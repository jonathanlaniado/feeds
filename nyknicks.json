Frank and Knox were subjected to 4 different coaches, including Fraudzale. It got capped off with Thibs, who really relies on vets.</p>\n<p>Now I'm not saying they both would have panned out, nor that they would be stars, but the teams that usually \"miss\" in the draft are usually shit organizations with terrible player development.</p>\n<p>A good example is Tim Hardaway, who gets better every time he left. We have great assistants now, so I feel the future is bright for our current rooks.</p>\n<p>Knox and Frank were Top 10 picks on most draft boards, but I think most rookies fail because of their situations. Take the Orlando Magic for example. They have a reputation of always picking one pick too late, but look at their picks: Oladipo (2), Aaron Gordon (4), Super Mario (5), Isaac (6) and Bamba (6). I really doubt those guys would all be busts or underachievers if they were drafted by another team. And Oladipo became a star when he left till the injuries.</p>\n<p>This is all a long way of saying that it's easy to always blame the players, but we have been a trash organization for a long time and the team should probably take more of the blame for the failure of these two guys. Luckily, I think we are on the right track now. I wish these guys the best in their future endeavors.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>EDIT: Controversial take on this sub:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Knicks have been terrible at developing players.</li>\n<li>Bad teams are bad at developing players.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Next time I'll post something less controversial.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>EDIT 2: This really is a nature vs. nurture debate it seems. </p></div>",
