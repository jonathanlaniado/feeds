Elf doesn\u2019t fit, DRose would be a decent back-up and IQ can fill the role of a PG/SG. Sexton won\u2019t cost us the entire team or our young chips like RJ, who I consider untouchable. Maybe they lure him with the two first rounders and Obi, whose only going to be a back-up to Julius. If they want to throw in Elf or Burks in the mix, I\u2019m fine with that as I think Bullock is a better defender then Alec. \n\nThe D Lil trade talk for me, is too much. Knicks trading away all of their young talent, like RJ and/or Mitch plus all of their draft capital for     a soon to be 32 year old seems like old Knicks. Go for the home run and strike out. Not saying I wouldn\u2019t take Lilliard, he\u2019s a superstar, but he\u2019ll cost us part of the future and franchise.",

Is Dame, Randle, Mitch and and whatever free agents we can get good enough to compete for a title? \n\nUnless one of the free agents is Kawhi, the answer is no. And if we would trade for Dame with the hopes of signing a big free agent next year, why don\u2019t we just wait? \n\nWe could avoid mortgaging our entire future and still sign 1-2 max players next offseason.
