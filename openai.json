For LLM self-supervised pre-training, the training signal is transformed from an indication of which token should be predicted next, into a probability distribution over all tokens by taking into account the prediction of the larger model. So the probability mass is distributed over all tokens in a meaningful way. A concrete example would be that the smaller model learns synonyms much faster, because the teacher has similar prediction probabilities for synonyms given a context. But this goes way beyond synonyms, it allows the student network to learn complex prediction targets, to take advantage of the \"wisdom\" of the teacher network, with far fewer parameters.</p>\n<p>Given a capable enough teacher and a well-designed distillation approach, it is plausible to get GPT-4 level performance, with half the parameters (or even fewer). </p>\n<p>This would make sense from a compute perspective. Because given a large enough user base, the compute required for training is quickly dwarfed by the compute required for inference. A teacher model can be impractically large for large-scale usage, but for distillation, inference is done only once for the training data of the student. For instance they could have a 5 trillion parameter model distilled into a 500 billion one, that still is better than GPT-4.</p>\n<p>This strategy would also allow controlled, gradual increase of capability of new releases, just enough to stay ahead of the competition, and not cause too much surprise and unwanted attention from the doomer crowd. </p>",

Told it to make up a Pomodoro Timer app from scratch. And the result was INCREDIBLE...As a software dev', I'm starting to shi* my pants a bit...HAHAHA</p>\n<p>Here's a breakdown of what it got:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The UI?</strong> Got everything: the timer, buttons to control it, settings to tweak your Pomodoro lengths, a neat section explaining the Pomodoro Technique, and even a task list.</li>\n<li><strong>Timer logic</strong>: Starts, pauses, resets, and switches between sessions.</li>\n<li><strong>Customize it your way</strong>: More chill breaks? Just hit up the settings.</li>\n<li><strong>Style</strong>: Got some cool pulsating effects and it's responsive too, so it looks awesome no matter where you're checking it from.</li>\n<li><strong>No edits, all AI</strong>: Yep, this was all Claud 3's magic. Dropped over 300 lines of super coherent code just like that.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Guys, I'm legit amazed here. Watching AI pull this off with zero help from me is just... wow. Had to share with y'all 'cause it's too cool not to. What do you guys think? Ever seen AI pull off something this cool?</p>\n<p>Went from:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/44bqgq4af5qc1.png?width=754&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e396ee8f8730795dbeeccacbb910bc28819ad14d\">FIRST VERSION</a></p>\n<p>To:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/bm0jkztff5qc1.png?width=491&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3833b4185f76f4964d03b02f7e657875a1672911\">FINAL VERSION</a></p>",

It's like having a photo with lots of static that makes it hard to see, and then the program cleans it up step by step until it looks like a normal photo.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how it works using a fun example:</p>\n<p>Imagine you have a very messy room (this is like the noisy image). Each day for a week (each step or T step), you clean up a bit of the mess (this is the denoising part). Each night, your little brother comes in and messes up the room again, but less than before (this is adding noise back but less each time). By the end of the week, your room is clean (this is the real, clear image). The math in the text tells the computer exactly how to clean the room each day and how much mess your brother will make each night.\u2019</p>\n<p>I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not a perfect explanation\u2026 but it gives me the motivation to read on and keep trying.</p>\n<p>I have to say, I\u2019m generally having an awesome time with GPT4 nowadays. Yes it can be a bit unpredictable at times. But good lord, I feel like a superhuman with this thing by my side.</p>\n<p>Sincerest thanks to Sam and the Team. </p><div><br></div><img src=\"https://i.redd.it/wt4x20qiz6mc1.jpeg\" />",
