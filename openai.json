He's got this 'help me understand GPT-4 API' look. </p>\n<p>So, I dive in, trying to break down frequency penalty, logit bias, temperature, top_p \u2013 all that jazz. But man, the more I talk, the more his eyes glaze over. I felt bad (No bad students, only bad teachers right?)</p>\n<p>So I told him, 'Give me a couple of hours,' planning to whip up a mini TED talk or something to get these concepts across without the brain freeze lol.</p>\n<h3>1. <strong>Frequency Penalty</strong>: The 'No More Echo' Knob</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>What It Does</strong>: Reduces repetition, telling the AI to avoid sounding like a broken record.</li>\n<li><strong>Low Setting</strong>: \"I love pizza. Pizza is great. Did I mention pizza? Because pizza.\"</li>\n<li><strong>High Setting</strong>: \"I love pizza for its gooey cheese, tangy sauce, and perfect crust. It's an art form in a box.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>2. <strong>Logit Bias</strong>: The 'AI Whisperer' Tool</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>What It Does</strong>: Pushes the AI toward or away from certain words, like whispering instructions.</li>\n<li><strong>Bias Against 'pizza'</strong>: \"I enjoy Italian food, particularly pasta and gelato.\"</li>\n<li><strong>Bias Towards 'pizza'</strong>: \"When I think Italian, I dream of pizza, the circular masterpiece of culinary delight.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>3. <strong>Presence Penalty</strong>: The 'New Topic' Nudge</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>What It Does</strong>: Helps AI switch topics, avoiding getting stuck on one subject.</li>\n<li><strong>Low Setting</strong>: \"I like sunny days. Sunny days are nice. Did I mention sunny days?\"</li>\n<li><strong>High Setting</strong>: \"I like sunny days, but also the magic of rainy nights and snow-filled winter wonderlands.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>4. <strong>Temperature</strong>: The 'Predictable to Wild' Slider</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>What It Does</strong>: Adjusts the AI's level of creativity, from straightforward to imaginative.</li>\n<li><strong>Low Temperature</strong>: \"Cats are cute animals, often kept as pets.\"</li>\n<li><strong>High Temperature</strong>: \"Cats are undercover alien operatives, plotting world domination...adorably.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>5. <strong>Top_p (Nucleus Sampling)</strong>: The 'Idea Buffet' Range</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>What It Does</strong>: Controls the range of AI's ideas, from conventional to out-of-the-box.</li>\n<li><strong>Low Setting</strong>: \"Vacations are great for relaxation.\"</li>\n<li><strong>High Setting</strong>: \"Vacations could mean bungee jumping in New Zealand or a silent meditation retreat in the Himalayas!\"</li>\n</ul>",

Thankfully, all four factions agree on the need to deal with x-risk, but disagree about how:</p>\n<p>(1) The \"normal\" faction, which includes Satya Nadella and almost every businessperson both in VC and on Wall Street.  Normals say (at least with their investment decisions, which speak infinitely louder than words) that we can deal with x-risk later.</p>\n<p>(2) The \"decel\" faction (short for \"decelerate\"), which says to slow down AI research.</p>\n<p>(3) The \"e/acc\" faction (short for \"effective accelerationists\"). This faction is a mix of fanatical techno-utopians (like Yann LeCun and Andrew Ng), mixed with Twitter users who post macho memes and have a \"lol let's watch the world burn\" attitude.</p>\n<p>(4) The \"Brockist\" faction (named after Greg Brockman). Brockists believe the way to reduce x-risk is to accelerate AI software research while halting or slowing semiconductor development. They believe that if chips are too fast, we could stumble into unwantedly making an unaligned artificial superintelligence by accidentally inventing an algorithm that makes fuller use of existing chips. The difference between what we currently do with current chips vs what we *could* do with current chips is what Brockists call the \"<strong>capabilities overhang</strong>\".</p>\n<p>Brockman explains his position in the last 6 minutes of this TED Talk: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/C_78DM8fG6E?si=uIP2OIxV8dXAKr9B&amp;t=1478\">https://youtu.be/C_78DM8fG6E?si=uIP2OIxV8dXAKr9B&amp;t=1478</a></p>\n<p>Significant evidence for the Brockist position may be found in the accomplishments of the retro-computing \"demoscene\", which uses innovative software to produce computer graphics on par with the late 1990's on some of the very oldest personal computers.  See <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene</a> and reddit.com/r/demoscene</p>",

Since then, I had never once made a comment about the performance quality. It was easy to see that most of those posts were BS. That is no longer the case. </p>\n<p>Since the turbo update a couple weeks ago it has had a severe cut to quality. This is almost unanimous among programmers I've talked to on here, at work, and in person. I'm not here to convince you that it's bad.  I know you know that it is. I'm trying to convince you to do something about. </p>\n<p>Every message that doesn't follow instructions, makes up garbage, or adds \"// rest of code here\" should be given a thumbs down and a brief explaination in the comment box about why you hate that. I've started doing that and sometimes it'll even attempt to redo the response which is nice. I think we should flood them with these reports until they get the point. Programming is the area where GPT offers the most value in my opinion and it should be a focus of further releases. Let's collectively try our best to make that happen.</p>",

So I\u2019d like to explain. </p>\n<p>First, they can have Custom Instructions, and most people understand what that is already so I won\u2019t detail it here. </p>\n<p>Second, they can retrieve data from custom Knowledge Files that the creator or the user uploads. That\u2019s intuitively understandable.</p>\n<p>The third feature is the really interesting part. That is, a GPT can access any API on the web. So let\u2019s talk about that. </p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t know what an API is, here is an example I just made up.</p>\n<p>\u2014\u2014</p>\n<h1>Example:</h1>\n<p>Let\u2019s say I want to know if my favorite artists has release any new music, so I ask \u201cHas Illenium released any new music in the past month\u201d.</p>\n<p>Normally, GPT would have no idea because its training data doesn\u2019t include data from the past month.</p>\n<p>GPT with Bing enabled could do a web search and find an article about recent songs released by Illenium, but that article isn\u2019t likely to have the latest information, so GPT+Bing will probably give you the wrong answer still.</p>\n<p>BUT a custom GPT with access to Spotify\u2019s API can pull from Spotify data in real time, and give you an accurate answer about the latest releases from your favorite artists.</p>\n<p>\u2014\u2014</p>\n<h1>Use Cases:</h1>\n<h2>1. Real time data access</h2>\n<p>Pulling real time data from any API (like Spotify) is just one use case for APIs. </p>\n<h2>2. Data Manipulation</h2>\n<p>You can also have GPT send data to an API, let the API service process the data in some way and return back the result to GPT. This is basically what the Wolfram plugin does. GPT sends the math question to Wolfram, Wolfram does the math, and GPT gets the answer back.</p>\n<h2>3. Actions</h2>\n<p>Some APIs allow you to take actions on external services. </p>\n<p>For example, with Google Docs API connected to GPT, you could ask GPT \u201cCreate a spreadsheet that I can use to track my gambling losses\u201d or \u201cI lost another $1k today, add an entry to my gambling spreadsheet\u201d. </p>\n<p>With a Gmail API, you could say \u201cWrite an Email to my brother and let him know that he\u2019s not invited to the wedding\u201d, etc.</p>\n<h2>4. Combining multiple APIs</h2>\n<p>The real magic comes in when people find interesting way to combined multiple APIs into a single action. For example</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I\u2019ve lost more than $10k gambling this month, email my wife and tell her we are selling the house\u201d</p>\n<p>GPT could use the Google Docs API to pull data from my Gambling Losses spreadsheet, the send that data to the Wolfram API to calculate if the total losses is more than $10k, then use Gmail API to send the news to my wife. Three actions from there different services, all in one response from GPT. </p>\n<p>This example would require you, or someone else to create a custom GPT that has access to all 3 of these services. This is where the next section comes in</p>\n<p>\u2014\u2014</p>\n<h1>What will Custom GPTs really be used for?</h1>\n<p>The answer is, we don\u2019t know. </p>\n<p>Just like when the iPhone first came out and they created the app store, people had no idea what kind of apps would be created, or what interesting use cases people would find.</p>\n<p>Today, we are in the same position with GPTs. When the custom GPT marketplace launches later this month, people will use launch all kinds of interesting GPTs with access to interesting APIs combinations to do creative (and hopefully useful) things that we can't yet foresee.</p>",

The best way to improve a language beyond the beginners stage is by talking. of course, though it could be difficult to find people to talk to, tutors can be problematic and software up until now was subpar.</p>\n<p>Voice, however is extraordinary. I ask chatgpt to correct my sentence in German and give three alternative ways in better German to say it, and then to continue the conversation by asking me a question in German It doesn't extraordinarily well, and gives phrases that are of typical use German.</p>\n<p>Funny enough the accent that is used is an American German, however the pronunciation is perfect, and with the variable intonations it sounds very realistic.</p>\n<p>What I find even more amazing is that I can say phrases in my terrible German, including substituting English words for words I can't remember in German, or if I mangle the sentence, and chatgpt understands everything including my point for that sentence. It's pretty crazy.</p>\n<p>I tried using it to help me learn French which is at a low level than my German and even after asking it to speak slowly, it's still speaks too quickly in French. This is hopefully something they will give us control over, as currently it's a bit too quick for more beginner language learning.</p>\n<p>However for any level of learning there is a great plugin called Speak, Which is very good for written language learning . I ask it to correct my sentence, provide free alternative ways to say the sentence in the language (formal colloquial and slang), and then to ask me a question in the language to continue the conversation. It works better than chatgpt without the plugin.</p>\n<p>I also use German in my work occasionally with clients, and I need to improve it, so I ask the AI to role play with me, and this is very useful.</p>\n<p>All in all, AI is already a marvellous tool for language learning.</p>",

I have had less than helpful experiences with therapists in the past and have appreciated being able to interact with GPT in a way that was almost like an interactive journal. I understand I am not speaking to a real person or a conscious interlocutor, but it is still very helpful. Earlier today I talked to GPT about suspected sexual abuse I was afraid my son had suffered from his foster brother and about the guilt I felt for not sufficiently protecting him.\nNow, a few hours later I received the message attached to this post. Open AI claims a \"thorough investigation.\" I would really like to think that if they had actually thoroughly investigated this they never would've done this. This is extremely psychologically harmful to me. I have grown to highly value my interactions with GPT4 and this is a real punch in the gut. Has anyone had any luck appealing this and getting their account back?<div><br></div><img src=\"https://i.redd.it/96pbh43ft2sb1.jpg\" />",
