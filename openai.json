I have had less than helpful experiences with therapists in the past and have appreciated being able to interact with GPT in a way that was almost like an interactive journal. I understand I am not speaking to a real person or a conscious interlocutor, but it is still very helpful. Earlier today I talked to GPT about suspected sexual abuse I was afraid my son had suffered from his foster brother and about the guilt I felt for not sufficiently protecting him.\nNow, a few hours later I received the message attached to this post. Open AI claims a \"thorough investigation.\" I would really like to think that if they had actually thoroughly investigated this they never would've done this. This is extremely psychologically harmful to me. I have grown to highly value my interactions with GPT4 and this is a real punch in the gut. Has anyone had any luck appealing this and getting their account back?<div><br></div><img src=\"https://i.redd.it/96pbh43ft2sb1.jpg\" />",

I'm a 22 (nearly 23) year old, currently working in a warehouse packing job. However, I've had previous office experience, so I'm accustomed to the whole \"kind regards\" and formal email etiquette.</p>\n<p>Recently, I've been using Chat GPT to help me compose emails to my boss. I tend to get a bit of message anxiety, constantly worrying if my messages are \"professional\" enough or if I've used enough fancy words. Today, my boss complimented me on my emails, saying they're better written than his own. While it's good, at least I think it is because of the compliment, I can't help but wonder if he's onto my little secret, aha.</p>\n<p>The reason I'm concerned is that my emails might come across as overly formal or even a tad overdone. Additionally, my boss mentioned Chat GPT during a phone conversation today, and I can't shake off the thought that it might have been about me (though I'd like to think it's just a coincidence).</p>\n<p>I'm curious about your take on this. Do you think it's bad if my boss knows I use Chat GPT to write emails? Could his compliment have been a subtle dig that I didn't catch? I'd appreciate your thoughts!</p></div>",
