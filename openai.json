I'm a 22 (nearly 23) year old, currently working in a warehouse packing job. However, I've had previous office experience, so I'm accustomed to the whole \"kind regards\" and formal email etiquette.</p>\n<p>Recently, I've been using Chat GPT to help me compose emails to my boss. I tend to get a bit of message anxiety, constantly worrying if my messages are \"professional\" enough or if I've used enough fancy words. Today, my boss complimented me on my emails, saying they're better written than his own. While it's good, at least I think it is because of the compliment, I can't help but wonder if he's onto my little secret, aha.</p>\n<p>The reason I'm concerned is that my emails might come across as overly formal or even a tad overdone. Additionally, my boss mentioned Chat GPT during a phone conversation today, and I can't shake off the thought that it might have been about me (though I'd like to think it's just a coincidence).</p>\n<p>I'm curious about your take on this. Do you think it's bad if my boss knows I use Chat GPT to write emails? Could his compliment have been a subtle dig that I didn't catch? I'd appreciate your thoughts!</p></div>",
