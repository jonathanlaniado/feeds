She\u2019s been less and less happy with all of the cool stuff I\u2019ve made and there is no way to convince her otherwise. Even when it\u2019s things she uses every day. </p>\n<p>So I\u2019m ripping all 40+ smart switches out of the house today. </p>\n<p>I guess I\u2019m just disappointed. </p>\n<p>Been a great and helpful community.  Take care you guys.</p>\n<p>EDIT. Well this got more response than I expected. Ha! My wife is an odd one. She\u2019s incredibly stubborn and right off the get go she made up her mind that she didn\u2019t like it. (She\u2019s a retired electrician and historically hated working on smart homes) I mistakenly pushed the issue and figured that if I just kept making our lives easier that she would see the value in it. It just didn\u2019t make any sense to me that something I find so useful would be unable to convince her of the value of it. </p>\n<p>I was mistaken.  We are just different people. She will never accept it if she has made up her mind not to. </p>\n<p>So. Basically it\u2019s not a hill I want to die on. </p>\n<p>We do get long pretty well overall. There\u2019s give and take in any relationship. If this is what she needs to feel happier in the house then I\u2019m ok with that. It just sucks. I really enjoy home automation.  </p>\n<p>I think her views are ridiculous, but someone\u2019s feelings are someone\u2019s feelings. No matter how I struggle to understand, the fact is that they still are there. </p>\n<p>Anyways. Thanks for all the response.</p>\n<p>EDIT EDIT: major breakthrough. She does admit to seeing value in some HA aspects. She now said she would be happy to just have all the main switches she uses put back.</p>",

My girlfriend is American and we live in Scandinavia. My mother in law (who still lives in America) can sometimes be very codependent emotionally. My girlfriend talk to her on the phone everyday and often have to help her with technical things like getting directions to new places and printing stuff. She would most likely be fine but I think she just like the reassurance. To have some connection to us. </p>\n<p>Last winter we were visiting her. We had just put up a camera at home and I was showing her the feed. She took an interest to it and that gave me an idea. I threw together a very easy dashboard. The camera feed, some sensors to show if we are home. Mostly just for fun I added the controller to our door. I help her install the app, gave her a user and limited the access to just the new dashboard, so she wouldn't be confused. She really liked it. To have a small windows in to our life. The camera is just in the driveway so it wasn't intruding on our privacy. </p>\n<p>A week later or so, we were heading home. It was a long trip (24h+) and when we finally got home we where exhausted. We brought in our stuff and pretty much fell asleep instantly. And I forgot to lock the door. No biggie. We live on the country side and just finding your way to our house is challenging enough. Having the door unlocked when we are home isn't a big concern to me. But when I woke up the door was locked. My mother in law told my girlfriend the next day during a call that she knew we where asleep, but she saw the door was unlocked, so she locked it. She was ectatic. I think she really enjoyed that she could do something for us. Be involved and keep us safe by locking the door.</p>\n<p>So ever since I sometimes \"forget\" to lock the door in the evenings, and in the mornings when I wake up, it's normally locked.</p>",
