Yesterday my genius son left a pot on the range unattended, it burned the pan and contents and filled the bottom floor and middle floor of the house with smoke. I was alerted on the top floor when the smoke detector went off on that level and turned on all the lights in the house (thanks Z-Wave smoke detectors!). Went down he was already taking the smoking pan outside, house was a smoke filled mess. Opened the doors on the lower level and windows to vent out. Then closed up and went out for the evening.</p>\n<p>Last night it got below freezing outside and I went over to spend the night with a friend. Was woken at 2am by my phone alarming that the bottom floor inside temp sensor had passed below 37 degrees F (2-3d C). Called the house and found that wonder child had decided to open the downstairs windows *AGAIN* to further air out the house and had gone to bed. On a below freezing night. After turning off the mini split heat.....</p>\n<p>Woke up said wonder boy and wife, and they closed the windows. Remotely turned on the lower floor mini-split heat as well as the old furnace (tied into HA with relay override controls) to warm the lower level and keep the pipes from freezing. Watched the temps come back up, went to sleep, came home and all was well.</p>\n<p>If HA had not been around I probably would have come home this morning to frozen and broken pipes. As it was it just turned out to be some nighttime calls. And if I hadn't been able to reach someone I could have either driven back to close the windows or turned off the water main with the HA controlled main water shut off valve.</p>\n<p>So thank you HA for saving me some serious money and plumber time today. Much appreciated!</p>",

Thought I would have it under a step so I could build automations with it based on if someone walked up the stairs.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, it was not sensitive enough to sense the vibrations from the stairs and I have had a hard time finding a sensible use for it.</p>\n<p>So that it wouldn't be a complete waste of money, I built an automation that makes my nest mini in the entrance say random nasty words every time I shake the sensor. I\u2019m calling it my tourettes button. I\u2019ts silly, I know.</p>\n<p>Tonight, after dinner, my 4 \u00bd year old daughter put on a unicorn mask and was going to put on a dance and song show along with her 2 year old sister for me and my partner. Taking turns, both children lined up all the toy figures in a crescent on the living room floor. Pretending they were gonna be the audience with me and my partner. Everyone got fake ice cream and sushi to enjoy before the show.</p>\n<p>Me and my partner were getting a little impatient, we had probably waited a good 10 minutes for the show to start. I began to suspect that maybe there wasn't a show and that my older daughter was procrastinating because she got stage fright or couldn\u2019t come up with a fitting song.</p>\n<p>So we pushed her a little and wondered if it was going to be a show or not.</p>\n<p>She goes out to the entrance as if to prepare for the grand opening. All of a sudden we hear the speaker in the entrance say out loud \"POOP D!*K!!!\"... *Silence for a couple of seconds* My daughter had accessed my tourettes button.</p>\n<p>What follows next is that my daughter jumps into the doorway to the living room, full on unicorn mode and proclaims:</p>\n<p>\"Today we're going to sing about the poop d!\u2019k, because Google said so\"</p>\n<p>Then follows 10 minutes of booth my kids scream-singing on the top of their lungs about the poop d!*k and that they are going to poop on the poop d!*k.</p>\n<p>I pray they forget about this before returning to preschool om monday.</p>",

We're in the final testing phase and are seeking beta testers. It uses an ESP32-C3 with local control through ESPHome so it will be easy to setup! We're looking for feedback on features that need enhancement or new ideas that could be incorporated. If you are interested in the AIR-1 as well as beta testing then please fill out our survey in the comments section below so we can notify you when available.</p>\n<p>AIR-1 Sensors:\n- MiCS-4514: CO, Methane, C2H5OH (Alcohol), H2, NO2, NH3\n- SCD40: CO2, temperature, humidity\n- SEN55: Particulate matter (PM1, PM2.5, PM 4, PM10), VOCs, NOx, humidity, temperature\n- DPS310: Barometric air pressure, temperature</p>\n<p>The AIR-1 measures just 61mm x 61mm x 30mm, and we have focused on efficient heat management within this small package to maintain sensor accuracy. This includes a thoughtful PCB layout and case design, incorporating ventilation and strategic component placement.</p>\n<p>Future sensor and power expandability with a modular connector... \ud83d\ude09</p>\n<p>All related resources, including CAD models and firmware, are open-source and available on our <a href=\"https://github.com/ApolloAutomation/AIR-1\">GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p>Check out the AIR-1 in our <a href=\"https://shop.apolloautomation.cloud/products/air-1\">Shop</a>.</p>\n<p>Feel free to let us know of any thoughts or improvements in the comments section below.

The hormann smart unit cost like \u00a3100 and required loads of wiring in. The gates might have been possible to use a 433mhz set up but frankly I\u2019ve integrated that into home assistant years ago and it was flaky. I did try and solder stuff directly onto the remote but I\u2019m a shit solderer and it was too fiddly. So I had a switchbot lying around and sure enough it works a treat so I got another - grabbed some of the kids Lego to house them and the switchbots now faithfully press the remote buttons to open the garage door and drive gates. Sometimes the least elegant solutions are the most reliable. Happy hacking.</p><div><br></div><img src=\"https://i.redd.it/57nss78cl0wb1.jpg\" />",

She\u2019s been less and less happy with all of the cool stuff I\u2019ve made and there is no way to convince her otherwise. Even when it\u2019s things she uses every day. </p>\n<p>So I\u2019m ripping all 40+ smart switches out of the house today. </p>\n<p>I guess I\u2019m just disappointed. </p>\n<p>Been a great and helpful community.  Take care you guys.</p>\n<p>EDIT. Well this got more response than I expected. Ha! My wife is an odd one. She\u2019s incredibly stubborn and right off the get go she made up her mind that she didn\u2019t like it. (She\u2019s a retired electrician and historically hated working on smart homes) I mistakenly pushed the issue and figured that if I just kept making our lives easier that she would see the value in it. It just didn\u2019t make any sense to me that something I find so useful would be unable to convince her of the value of it. </p>\n<p>I was mistaken.  We are just different people. She will never accept it if she has made up her mind not to. </p>\n<p>So. Basically it\u2019s not a hill I want to die on. </p>\n<p>We do get long pretty well overall. There\u2019s give and take in any relationship. If this is what she needs to feel happier in the house then I\u2019m ok with that. It just sucks. I really enjoy home automation.  </p>\n<p>I think her views are ridiculous, but someone\u2019s feelings are someone\u2019s feelings. No matter how I struggle to understand, the fact is that they still are there. </p>\n<p>Anyways. Thanks for all the response.</p>\n<p>EDIT EDIT: major breakthrough. She does admit to seeing value in some HA aspects. She now said she would be happy to just have all the main switches she uses put back.</p>",

My girlfriend is American and we live in Scandinavia. My mother in law (who still lives in America) can sometimes be very codependent emotionally. My girlfriend talk to her on the phone everyday and often have to help her with technical things like getting directions to new places and printing stuff. She would most likely be fine but I think she just like the reassurance. To have some connection to us. </p>\n<p>Last winter we were visiting her. We had just put up a camera at home and I was showing her the feed. She took an interest to it and that gave me an idea. I threw together a very easy dashboard. The camera feed, some sensors to show if we are home. Mostly just for fun I added the controller to our door. I help her install the app, gave her a user and limited the access to just the new dashboard, so she wouldn't be confused. She really liked it. To have a small windows in to our life. The camera is just in the driveway so it wasn't intruding on our privacy. </p>\n<p>A week later or so, we were heading home. It was a long trip (24h+) and when we finally got home we where exhausted. We brought in our stuff and pretty much fell asleep instantly. And I forgot to lock the door. No biggie. We live on the country side and just finding your way to our house is challenging enough. Having the door unlocked when we are home isn't a big concern to me. But when I woke up the door was locked. My mother in law told my girlfriend the next day during a call that she knew we where asleep, but she saw the door was unlocked, so she locked it. She was ectatic. I think she really enjoyed that she could do something for us. Be involved and keep us safe by locking the door.</p>\n<p>So ever since I sometimes \"forget\" to lock the door in the evenings, and in the mornings when I wake up, it's normally locked.</p>",
