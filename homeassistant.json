Lovelace is lovely, but once I start explaining which tab or section to find certain controls on, I can see eyes glaze over and I lose the people really quickly.  </p>\n<p>One of my inspirations is Madelena's really great dashboard:  <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/uc79cv/a_maximalist_approach_on_designing_the_ha/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/uc79cv/a_maximalist_approach_on_designing_the_ha/</a>  <br />\nBut while I personally love the style of maximalist info overload, for my intended audience, I tried to only pack in as much information as I could without cluttering anything.  </p>\n<p>So I've been working on a whole new dashboard using ha-floorplan and just wanted to share my progress so far. This is a very rough work-in-progress with a lot of placeholder images and non-finalized styling.

In our <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/1jahptr/should_we_launch_a_poe_mmwave_sensor_next/\">last post</a>, we asked whether we should make a PoE (Power over Ethernet) version of our existing mmWave sensor, the <a href=\"https://sensy-one.com/products/sensy-one-s1\">Sensy-One S1,</a> and your overwhelming response made our decision an easy one! We\u2019re excited to announce that the PoE version is now in development!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/x7gr1gqw2wpe1.png?width=539&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83fcca643fbba98c81606c35cab2a5649514fe4d\">ESP32-S3-POE-ETH (dev)</a></p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t need PoE, the original Sensy-One S1 is still available, and if you want to be the first to know when the PoE model launches (targeting early to mid-April), make sure to <a href=\"https://sensy-one.com/\">subscribe</a> on our website for updates!</p>\n<p>In the meantime, you can check out our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-Rij8gbK3s\">YouTube</a> video for an in-depth look at the S1 and explore our <a href=\"https://github.com/sensy-one/mmwave-sensor\">GitHub</a> repository for all the documentation. Thanks again for your support, and I can\u2019t wait to share more news soon!</p>",

It was only a side project as I could find something I liked for my dashboard. It's now one of the most used custom card in Home Assistant \ud83e\udd2f. Thank you all for your support \u2764\ufe0f.</p>\n<p>2 years ago, the <a href=\"https://www.home-assistant.io/dashboards/tile/\">tile card</a> has been introduced. The look and feel and many features are heavily inspired by Mushroom cards. Many people asked to add features from Mushroom to Home Assistant. Overtime, the official cards has been improved (tile, card features, badges, heading card, ...). And now... I get the inverse feedback : every time a new feature is added to official cards, I got the feature request for Mushroom \ud83d\ude43.</p>\n<p>If you have some time, I would be very grateful by your answer to these questions :</p>\n<p>- <strong>Why are you still using Mushroom cards?</strong></p>\n<p>- <strong>What features or reasons block you to switch to official Home Assistant cards</strong> (e.g. <a href=\"https://www.home-assistant.io/dashboards/tile/\">tile card</a> and <a href=\"https://www.home-assistant.io/dashboards/badges/\">badges</a>)?</p>\n<p>I already have a good idea of \u200b\u200bthe answers but I would like to have a more precise view to better guide the future development of Mushroom.</p>\n<p>The final goal is to have Mushroom cards as complementary cards instead of duplicating tile cards and badges to Mushroom.</p>\n<p>Thank you again for all the support \ud83c\udf44</p>",

When I see rude or demeaning comments on GitHub or the forum, it genuinely affects me - I know it shouldn't, but it does. I understand frustration when things aren't working or features are missing, but my time is limited, and I have to prioritize.</p>\n<p>With 17k-65k users (a wide range, I know), each with different devices and setups, and Roborock constantly releasing new models, I often have to focus on reverse-engineering new functionality just to keep things working. This takes priority over new features.</p>\n<p>Just because you don't see new entities with every release doesn't mean there's no progress. I'm constantly working on maintaining functionality, preventing IP bans, addressing API changes and dependency issues, and even currently working on a major map image improvement (with help from core devs). These things take time.</p>\n<p>My point is: please remember you're interacting with a volunteer. Frustration is understandable, but expressing it rudely discourages me. I appreciate the vast majority of users who are patient, kind, and appreciative. A little empathy goes a long way.</p>\n<p>EDIT: I am very appreciative of all of the kind words people are leaving below - I'm also always appreciate of when users stand up for me within github issues when other users are being rude. So thank you to all of you, I hope everyone can keep this post in the back of their mind when they interact on issue boards in the future!</p>",

Yesterday my genius son left a pot on the range unattended, it burned the pan and contents and filled the bottom floor and middle floor of the house with smoke. I was alerted on the top floor when the smoke detector went off on that level and turned on all the lights in the house (thanks Z-Wave smoke detectors!). Went down he was already taking the smoking pan outside, house was a smoke filled mess. Opened the doors on the lower level and windows to vent out. Then closed up and went out for the evening.</p>\n<p>Last night it got below freezing outside and I went over to spend the night with a friend. Was woken at 2am by my phone alarming that the bottom floor inside temp sensor had passed below 37 degrees F (2-3d C). Called the house and found that wonder child had decided to open the downstairs windows *AGAIN* to further air out the house and had gone to bed. On a below freezing night. After turning off the mini split heat.....</p>\n<p>Woke up said wonder boy and wife, and they closed the windows. Remotely turned on the lower floor mini-split heat as well as the old furnace (tied into HA with relay override controls) to warm the lower level and keep the pipes from freezing. Watched the temps come back up, went to sleep, came home and all was well.</p>\n<p>If HA had not been around I probably would have come home this morning to frozen and broken pipes. As it was it just turned out to be some nighttime calls. And if I hadn't been able to reach someone I could have either driven back to close the windows or turned off the water main with the HA controlled main water shut off valve.</p>\n<p>So thank you HA for saving me some serious money and plumber time today. Much appreciated!</p>",

Thought I would have it under a step so I could build automations with it based on if someone walked up the stairs.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, it was not sensitive enough to sense the vibrations from the stairs and I have had a hard time finding a sensible use for it.</p>\n<p>So that it wouldn't be a complete waste of money, I built an automation that makes my nest mini in the entrance say random nasty words every time I shake the sensor. I\u2019m calling it my tourettes button. I\u2019ts silly, I know.</p>\n<p>Tonight, after dinner, my 4 \u00bd year old daughter put on a unicorn mask and was going to put on a dance and song show along with her 2 year old sister for me and my partner. Taking turns, both children lined up all the toy figures in a crescent on the living room floor. Pretending they were gonna be the audience with me and my partner. Everyone got fake ice cream and sushi to enjoy before the show.</p>\n<p>Me and my partner were getting a little impatient, we had probably waited a good 10 minutes for the show to start. I began to suspect that maybe there wasn't a show and that my older daughter was procrastinating because she got stage fright or couldn\u2019t come up with a fitting song.</p>\n<p>So we pushed her a little and wondered if it was going to be a show or not.</p>\n<p>She goes out to the entrance as if to prepare for the grand opening. All of a sudden we hear the speaker in the entrance say out loud \"POOP D!*K!!!\"... *Silence for a couple of seconds* My daughter had accessed my tourettes button.</p>\n<p>What follows next is that my daughter jumps into the doorway to the living room, full on unicorn mode and proclaims:</p>\n<p>\"Today we're going to sing about the poop d!\u2019k, because Google said so\"</p>\n<p>Then follows 10 minutes of booth my kids scream-singing on the top of their lungs about the poop d!*k and that they are going to poop on the poop d!*k.</p>\n<p>I pray they forget about this before returning to preschool om monday.</p>",

The hormann smart unit cost like \u00a3100 and required loads of wiring in. The gates might have been possible to use a 433mhz set up but frankly I\u2019ve integrated that into home assistant years ago and it was flaky. I did try and solder stuff directly onto the remote but I\u2019m a shit solderer and it was too fiddly. So I had a switchbot lying around and sure enough it works a treat so I got another - grabbed some of the kids Lego to house them and the switchbots now faithfully press the remote buttons to open the garage door and drive gates. Sometimes the least elegant solutions are the most reliable. Happy hacking.</p><div><br></div><img src=\"https://i.redd.it/57nss78cl0wb1.jpg\" />",
