            "content_html": "<p>Over the past few months (pretty much since 'finishing' my<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/1eyzvlv/my_ios_inspired_dashboard/\"> iOS inspired dashboard</a>) I\u2019ve been designing and refining a custom Home Assistant dashboard for an iPad Pro that lives on our kitchen counter which acts as our central command for glanceable info and (occasional) smart home control. </p>\n<p>The goal was to create something that felt polished, flexible, and easy to use - something that both looks good and is functional. Most of the interface is built using custom:button-card, with dynamic behaviour driven by input_select helpers and templated YAML. </p>\n<p>The design is very much inspired by iOS and Liquid Glass, while the layout is basically an open-source version of the Amazon Echo Show 15.</p>\n<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Header (Top Row)</strong></p>\n<p>The top of the screen shows key conditional info as chips like \u201cWashing Finished\u201d, \u201cDishwasher has X remaining\u201d, \u201cGarage Door Open\u201d, or how long our one year old has been asleep. These update automatically based on sensor states or automations.</p>\n<p><strong>Footer (Bottom Row)</strong></p>\n<p>The bottom row stays consistent across pages. It provides:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Quick access to popups (for lights and climate) using custom:bubble-card</li>\n<li>Media now playing in the kitchen/living zone (also has popups to control music / TV)</li>\n<li>Garage door status and control</li>\n<li>A shortcut to launch Assist via voice or text on the tablet</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Swipeable Body (Middle Section)</strong></p>\n<p>The main body of the dashboard is a two-row, four-column layout that swipes between two \u201cpages\u201d. The cards within it dynamically change depending on real-world conditions, using input_select helpers to determine which custom card template to show in each slot.</p>\n<p>For Example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the weather forecast predicts rain, the Weather Radar card will automatically replace the Calendar card.</li>\n<li>If there\u2019s a game on, a live scorecard replaces the Shortcuts card (which is still accessible via the footer).</li>\n<li>If music is playing on the kitchen HomePod, the music tile will move to the first page, swapping with the Shortcuts card.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each card is built as a reusable custom:button-card template and saved at the top of my YAML config, making it easy to rearrange or reuse cards elsewhere and minimising the amount of YAML in the actual dashboard itself.</p>\n<p><strong>Hardware / Setup</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The dashboard runs full-screen in the companion app on an iPad Pro (overkill, I know), with Guided Access enabled to lock it in place and prevent exiting the app (which can of course still be done with a password if someone wants to use the iPad as an iPad).</li>\n<li>An invisible push notification (sent from Home Assistant) wakes the screen when motion is detected in the kitchen - making it feel responsive and alive without any interaction.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What\u2019s Next</strong></p>\n<p>This is still a work in progress and I\u2019m always tweaking and trying to improve it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Some ideas include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A brief news headline card for real-time traffic and news updates (probably using ChatGPT to figure out which news headlines I actually care about / want to see)</li>\n<li>A way for my wife (and eventually my son) to leave quick written notes, like digital Post-Its</li>\n<li>Displaying family photos via <a href=\"https://immich.app\">Immich</a> running on a Raspberry Pi (when I finally get around to setting it up)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>^(PS You'll notice some of the attached screenshots are from earlier in the year, I've been meaning to post this for a while!)</p>",

You can find the code and docs over at <a href=\"https://github.com/lupusbytes/cs2mqtt\">https://github.com/lupusbytes/cs2mqtt</a></p><div><br></div><img src=\"https://i.redd.it/pxcedaz3hxpf1.png\" />",

Unfortunately, the vacuum is just a bit too tall to fit under the door, so I had to come up with a workaround.</p>\n<p>I designed the entire mechanism in Rhino, calculating the exact opening angle so I could also add a kickboard and completely hide the base. For the motor, I went with an Aqara E1, normally meant for smart curtains, because I didn\u2019t want to bother with more complex custom electronics. It still provides more than enough torque to easily swing the door open.</p>\n<p>The door opens automatically based on the robot\u2019s status, and the Aqara is plugged into a smart outlet that turns on depending on the battery level, so it\u2019s only powered when needed.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ll be uploading the STL to Printables soon for anyone who wants to give it a try.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>So, two days ago, u/Xibby posted <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/s/tSOohTf1KB\">this PSA</a> about water leak sensors. I'm here to say that they are absolutely right. Gather round, boys and girls, because it's story time!</p>\n<p>Two days ago, we got a water softener installed in our new house. At first, it worked fine, and everything was completely normal - until, it wasn't.</p>\n<p>Last night, Home Assistant sent a notification to my phone that a leak sensor which I had placed next to the water softener had detected moisture. At first, I thought this was a little strange, and that perhaps the sensor was faulty. But, of course, I decided that I'd better go downstairs and investigate anyway.</p>\n<p>No sooner did I reach the basement that all hell broke loose. My utility room (which contains my server rack...thankfully untouched) and our storage room floors were FILLED with water. I still need to call the vendor that installed the water softener, but it appears to be an improper installation.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I went into full blown panic mode...I immediately shut off the water and called my wife, and we had to grab every mop and rag we could find to mop up all the water. And this was about 9pm, so I couldn't even run to Home Depot for...anything.</p>\n<p>Long story short, the leak was mostly contained to two rooms which concrete floors, although there is a wall that will likely need to be ripped open and inspected.</p>\n<p>But here's the kicker - I only installed that Aqara water leak sensor <em>yesterday afternoon</em> (one for the water tank, one for the softener) - about 5 hours before the leak.</p>\n<p>I can only shudder at the thought of how much worse this would have been if I hadn't set up the sensors when I did. Plus, the automation I set up only sent a single notification to my phone, which I only saw 10 minutes after it was sent.</p>\n<p>Before going to bed last night, I realized that if that sensor had been tripped in the middle of the night, things also would have been very different. But then I found a post by u/jpb on <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/xlxqts/i_got_home_assistant_to_use_pagerduty_to_notify_me/\">integrating PagerDuty notifications</a> into Home Assistant. Needless to say, my water leak sensors will now play an announcement on our Alexa speakers, as well as trigger a PD incident that will call and text me and my family repeatedly until we acknowledge the notifications.</p>\n<p>Water leak sensors are worth every penny...and needless to say, I will be buying a heck of a lot more of them. Every sink and toilet in the house is getting one of these!</p>\n<p>I cannot stress this enough - it doesn't matter what kind of house you have, or how old it is. You might think you don't need them, until you do. If you don't have water leak sensors...get them. <strong>Right freaking now.</strong></p><div><br></div><img src=\"https://i.redd.it/wm1x9f0u5thf1.jpeg\" />",

Same design language and simplicity of Graphite, but tuned for E-Ink displays. Always wanted to do it, now I finally did. And the best part, the name finally feels spot on.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the start of the E-Ink branch, so things might not be perfect, but I\u2019d love your feedback to help shape them! The light one already looks great with some basic dashboard on my ONYX BOOX Palma. I think it could also work great on som info dashboards.</p>\n<p>Also gave the Theme Patcher some love, it's now a bit more flexible and robust. If you\u2019re using it, I\u2019d really appreciate any thoughts!</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>You know that look. The one your partner gives you when you excitedly explain how you just spent 6 hours getting a temperature sensor to display correctly on your dashboard. Yeah, that look.</p>\n<p>I've been deep in the Home Assistant rabbit hole for 3 years now. Started with a few smart bulbs, now I have 187 entities, 4 ESP32 boards running ESPHome, custom Node-RED flows, and a dashboard that would make Tony Stark jealous. My wife? She just wanted the lights to work when she flipped the switch.</p>\n<p>Everything changed last month when our newborn arrived. Sleep deprivation hit HARD. One night at 3 AM, while stumbling to the nursery for the fifth time, I had an epiphany.</p>\n<p>I created what I call the \"Midnight Parent Mode\" automation. Here's what it does:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Motion sensor detects movement in our bedroom between 11 PM - 6 AM</li>\n<li>Dims hallway lights to 5% warm white (just enough to see, not enough to wake you fully)</li>\n<li>Nursery door sensor triggers soft amber nightlight</li>\n<li>Temperature automatically adjusts to optimal baby sleep temp (68\u00b0F/20\u00b0C)</li>\n<li>White noise machine starts at low volume</li>\n<li>After 20 minutes of no motion, everything gradually fades back to off</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The kicker? I added a physical Zigbee button by the bed. One press activates \"feeding mode\" - slightly brighter lights, starts the bottle warmer (smart plug), and even logs the feeding time to a spreadsheet for the pediatrician.</p>\n<p>My wife's reaction? \"Why didn't you build THIS three years ago?!\"</p>\n<p>Now she's asking me to automate more things. ASKING. She even suggested we get presence sensors for the cars so the garage lights turn on automatically when we pull up.</p>\n<p><strong>The real lesson here:</strong> We get so caught up in what's technically possible that we forget to solve actual problems. Your family doesn't care about your perfect YAML or your 300ms response time. They care about things that make life easier.</p>\n<p>What's your \"spouse approval factor\" automation? I'm collecting ideas for Version 2.0 of Parent Mode!</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>You know that moment when your spouse gives you <em>the look</em> after the lights randomly turn on at 3 AM? Yeah, that was me last month. Again.</p>\n<p>I've been deep in the Home Assistant rabbit hole since 2022. Started with a single smart bulb, now running 147 devices across Zigbee, Z-Wave, WiFi, and even some ESP32s I flashed myself. But here's the thing - my family was ready to go back to regular switches after my \"clever\" automations kept failing at the worst times.</p>\n<p>The breaking point came when my presence detection failed during a dinner party. Picture this: 12 guests, fancy dinner, and suddenly the house thinks everyone left. Lights off. Music stops. Thermostat drops to away mode. My mother-in-law literally asked if we forgot to pay the electric bill.</p>\n<p>So I spent the next two weeks rebuilding EVERYTHING with one goal: make it invisible. No more \"hey Google,\" no more explaining why the bathroom fan runs for exactly 7 minutes, no more debugging in front of guests.</p>\n<p>Here's what actually worked:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ditched WiFi presence detection for these $12 Aqara FP2 sensors (seriously, mmWave is magic)</li>\n<li>Created \"manual override\" switches that disable automations for 2 hours when toggled</li>\n<li>Built a hidden dashboard showing what automation is controlling each room</li>\n<li>Added a \"guest mode\" that simplifies everything to basic on/off</li>\n<li>Most importantly: every automation now has a 10-second delay before triggering, giving people time to manually override</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The result? My wife now ASKS me to automate things. Last week she said \"can you make the coffee machine turn on when I enter the kitchen in the morning?\" I nearly cried.</p>\n<p>The real secret wasn't better code or fancier sensors. It was accepting that the best automation is the one nobody notices. Your family doesn't care about your perfectly crafted Node-RED flows - they just want the lights to work.</p>\n<p>Anyone else struggle with the WAF challenge? What's your biggest automation fail that taught you something valuable?</p>",

Today, after 5 (incredible) months of development and beta testing, I\u2019m finally releasing Bubble Card 3 on HACS, the biggest update I\u2019ve ever released for this project \u2764\ufe0f",
            "content_html": "<p>As you can see in these screenshots, the main new feature is the Module System, which brings something I\u2019ve wanted to include for a long time: better modularity, a smoother setup process, and more tools directly in the editor.</p>\n<p>With the new Module Store and Module Editor, you can now install, update, customize, and even create modules without ever leaving the editor. It makes everything feel much more easier and flexible, whether you're just exploring or building something more advanced. No more copying and pasting styles or templates into every card, now everything can be managed globally.</p>\n<p>You can even add your own form fields in the editor, just like with any Home Assistant feature (e.g. the color picker in one of these screenshots). This means you can now share your modules with anyone, even if they\u2019re not comfortable with code. And to make that even easier, the built-in Module Store lets you browse and install modules in a couple of clicks. Just like any app store!</p>\n<p>The community has already started sharing some amazing modules, and I believe this will really help bring everyone closer and make the whole ecosystem even more advanced.</p>\n<p>This update also introduces a brand new card: a full Calendar Card! Add to that better pop-up creation, smoother sliders, a more polished editor, dozens of improvements, and the fact that most of the code has been rewritten, and you get one of the biggest updates Bubble Card has ever had.</p>\n<p>I won\u2019t go into everything here, since the changelog is much longer. You can check it out here:<br />\n<a href=\"https://github.com/Clooos/Bubble-Card/releases/tag/v3.0.0\"><em>https://github.com/Clooos/Bubble-Card/releases/tag/v3.0.0</em></a></p>\n<p>I also made a short video showing the new features in action, feel free to check it out:<br />\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/zL-z5GG3p7Y\"><em>https://youtu.be/zL-z5GG3p7Y</em></a></p>\n<p>Most importantly, I want to say thank you to all of you. For the kind words I get almost every day, for your help testing and sharing ideas, and for your support. I'm really proud of how far this release has come, and incredibly grateful for this amazing community.</p>\n<p>Have fun with this new version. I can\u2019t wait for your feedback, to see what you\u2019ll build with it and what new modules will show up in the store!  </p>\n<p>Cheers everyone! \ud83c\udf7b</p>",

I've been working on a project that I think some of you might find useful or inspiring. Below are six screenshots showcasing what I\u2019ve built so far.</p>\n<p>As usual, I\u2019ll include all the HACS integrations I\u2019ve used and give full credit to the incredible people whose work made this possible.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m planning to write up a proper GitHub page for it this weekend. If you're interested, here\u2019s the placeholder link: <a href=\"https://github.com/reylinux/Dark-Transparent-Tablet-Dashboard\"><strong>reylinux/Dark-Transparent-Tablet-Dashboard</strong></a></p>\n<p><strong>First Image Details</strong></p>\n<p>This is the homepage where you can find the most important stuffs.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1st row: clock, date, weather forecast information, and room occupancy toggles (to trigger climate automation). Moving to the right we've got indoor / outdoor temp with climate control for the first tab, and sprinkler control on the other tab. Then we have a media with speaker count, and calendar to fit schedules of mine, wife, and special events, with alarm and a count of notification that links to the notification/weather panel/alarm that I will explain a bit later.</li>\n<li>2nd row: room cards with temp/humidity readings, light switch, a count of open door / windows (when applicable). </li>\n<li>3rd row: four main cameras for quick action. I had an issue with swipe card earlier so currently only displaying four of them.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Second Image Details</strong></p>\n<p>This is an example of a room. Let's divide this into three sections from left to right.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Left section: lighting controls. You'll swipe left or right to control the brightness of the lights. And the bottom section is a collapsible card to make it tidy for the lights that we don't usually control.</li>\n<li>Middle section: Temp / Humidity readings with a waterfall card that has a similar hex value on each threshold. My lowest to the highest temperature gradient is deep purple &gt; purple &gt; light blue &gt; green &gt; yellow &gt; orange &gt; red. For humidity there are only red and green.</li>\n<li>Right section: this is only for a pure aesthetic to fill the page nicely and will have a night / day look into it depends on the time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Third Image Details</strong></p>\n<p>This is a notification / weather panel. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Left section: Currently it's only showing 1 speaker playing a music. It has hidden chips for recycle day, dryer / washing, etc.. Below it, will show what lights that currently active.</li>\n<li>Middle section: this area contains weather status, forecast, and warnings if any (currently there's none)</li>\n<li>Right section: an iframe from <a href=\"http://Windy.com\">Windy.com</a> which has plenty of other map variations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Fourth Image Details</strong></p>\n<p>This page contains all the cameras. I am using Reolink CX410 / CX810, and E1 Pro. Under each camera, I've assigned the light switches in that area / the closest area for quick action.</p>\n<p><strong>Fifth Image Details</strong></p>\n<p>This page has scenes that I like. It is handled by automation and scripts to only run for hue lights in Living Area (10+ lights). There will be an off button once I run the scene, and it will only switch the lights back to normal where the sensors detect us and turn the rest of it gracefully with 2 seconds delay on each light in an order with 3s transition time.</p>\n<p><strong>Six Image Details</strong></p>\n<p>Last but not least, an Alarmo dedicated page. I've set this recently and it was super fun to turn the lights into red and run the alarm siren sound throughout the living area with 8x Google Minis.</p>",

This is a very rough work-in-progress with a lot of placeholder images and non-finalized styling.

In our <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/1jahptr/should_we_launch_a_poe_mmwave_sensor_next/\">last post</a>, we asked whether we should make a PoE (Power over Ethernet) version of our existing mmWave sensor, the <a href=\"https://sensy-one.com/products/sensy-one-s1\">Sensy-One S1,</a> and your overwhelming response made our decision an easy one! We\u2019re excited to announce that the PoE version is now in development!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/x7gr1gqw2wpe1.png?width=539&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83fcca643fbba98c81606c35cab2a5649514fe4d\">ESP32-S3-POE-ETH (dev)</a></p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t need PoE, the original Sensy-One S1 is still available, and if you want to be the first to know when the PoE model launches (targeting early to mid-April), make sure to <a href=\"https://sensy-one.com/\">subscribe</a> on our website for updates!</p>\n<p>In the meantime, you can check out our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-Rij8gbK3s\">YouTube</a> video for an in-depth look at the S1 and explore our <a href=\"https://github.com/sensy-one/mmwave-sensor\">GitHub</a> repository for all the documentation. Thanks again for your support, and I can\u2019t wait to share more news soon!</p>",

It was only a side project as I could find something I liked for my dashboard. It's now one of the most used custom card in Home Assistant \ud83e\udd2f. Thank you all for your support \u2764\ufe0f.</p>\n<p>2 years ago, the <a href=\"https://www.home-assistant.io/dashboards/tile/\">tile card</a> has been introduced. The look and feel and many features are heavily inspired by Mushroom cards. Many people asked to add features from Mushroom to Home Assistant. Overtime, the official cards has been improved (tile, card features, badges, heading card, ...). And now... I get the inverse feedback : every time a new feature is added to official cards, I got the feature request for Mushroom \ud83d\ude43.</p>\n<p>If you have some time, I would be very grateful by your answer to these questions :</p>\n<p>- <strong>Why are you still using Mushroom cards?</strong></p>\n<p>- <strong>What features or reasons block you to switch to official Home Assistant cards</strong> (e.g. <a href=\"https://www.home-assistant.io/dashboards/tile/\">tile card</a> and <a href=\"https://www.home-assistant.io/dashboards/badges/\">badges</a>)?</p>\n<p>I already have a good idea of \u200b\u200bthe answers but I would like to have a more precise view to better guide the future development of Mushroom.</p>\n<p>The final goal is to have Mushroom cards as complementary cards instead of duplicating tile cards and badges to Mushroom.</p>\n<p>Thank you again for all the support \ud83c\udf44</p>",

When I see rude or demeaning comments on GitHub or the forum, it genuinely affects me - I know it shouldn't, but it does. I understand frustration when things aren't working or features are missing, but my time is limited, and I have to prioritize.</p>\n<p>With 17k-65k users (a wide range, I know), each with different devices and setups, and Roborock constantly releasing new models, I often have to focus on reverse-engineering new functionality just to keep things working. This takes priority over new features.</p>\n<p>Just because you don't see new entities with every release doesn't mean there's no progress. I'm constantly working on maintaining functionality, preventing IP bans, addressing API changes and dependency issues, and even currently working on a major map image improvement (with help from core devs). These things take time.</p>\n<p>My point is: please remember you're interacting with a volunteer. Frustration is understandable, but expressing it rudely discourages me. I appreciate the vast majority of users who are patient, kind, and appreciative. A little empathy goes a long way.</p>\n<p>EDIT: I am very appreciative of all of the kind words people are leaving below - I'm also always appreciate of when users stand up for me within github issues when other users are being rude. So thank you to all of you, I hope everyone can keep this post in the back of their mind when they interact on issue boards in the future!</p>",

Yesterday my genius son left a pot on the range unattended, it burned the pan and contents and filled the bottom floor and middle floor of the house with smoke. I was alerted on the top floor when the smoke detector went off on that level and turned on all the lights in the house (thanks Z-Wave smoke detectors!). Went down he was already taking the smoking pan outside, house was a smoke filled mess. Opened the doors on the lower level and windows to vent out. Then closed up and went out for the evening.</p>\n<p>Last night it got below freezing outside and I went over to spend the night with a friend. Was woken at 2am by my phone alarming that the bottom floor inside temp sensor had passed below 37 degrees F (2-3d C). Called the house and found that wonder child had decided to open the downstairs windows *AGAIN* to further air out the house and had gone to bed. On a below freezing night. After turning off the mini split heat.....</p>\n<p>Woke up said wonder boy and wife, and they closed the windows. Remotely turned on the lower floor mini-split heat as well as the old furnace (tied into HA with relay override controls) to warm the lower level and keep the pipes from freezing. Watched the temps come back up, went to sleep, came home and all was well.</p>\n<p>If HA had not been around I probably would have come home this morning to frozen and broken pipes. As it was it just turned out to be some nighttime calls. And if I hadn't been able to reach someone I could have either driven back to close the windows or turned off the water main with the HA controlled main water shut off valve.</p>\n<p>So thank you HA for saving me some serious money and plumber time today. Much appreciated!</p>",
