I've called it, or better it called itself <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/g/g-Vm2F2rz8l-artwork-muse\">Artwork Muse</a>. I created it to solve an actual problem. I have a very old Music Library that spans back decades and there are about 100 songs that have no artwork and that no software can find artwork for.</p>\n<p>I figured I really don't care about the artwork per se, all I need is some artwork, so when I scroll through my music app I can quickly recognise it.</p>\n<p>So I've created <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/g/g-Vm2F2rz8l-artwork-muse\">Artwork Muse</a>. You give it a song and a title, or you upload a whole list. I makes a little web search to enrich the data and generates 1 artwork per item. Then it asks you to proceed until it is done. </p>\n<p>The process of creating <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/g/g-Vm2F2rz8l-artwork-muse\">Artwork Muse</a> has been really amazing. An iterative process, like any other app development, with the only difference that trial and error now took a few seconds per iteration. I started with GPT builder but then ended up editing the configuration manually, as I realised it leads to more \"accurate\" and \"predictable\" results.</p>\n<p>Let me know what you think and happy to discuss the why and the how of the various instructions. I feel there is already some important understanding in this small morning project: https://chat.openai.com/g/g-Vm2F2rz8l-artwork-muse</p>",
