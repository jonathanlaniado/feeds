I know there\u2019s been plenty of chatter around this, but it\u2019s genuinely head scratching that I had to vent here.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s 100% possible to ship this entire product as an extension. Chrome extensions 100% supports tab awareness permissions, Safari App Extensions appear to as well - which would effectively give you the \u201cpowerful\u201d browser context that Dia is supposed to be unique for. </p>\n<p>Nothing about Dia is unique. It feels like the product team got distracted by what Windsurf, Cursor, Copilot etc. all shipped and felt like it would be a good idea to do the same thing. </p>\n<p>What they seem to also be (weirdly) bullish of is the idea that the already 100s of millions of happy users on Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini would bail on their entire setup to use this bespoke desktop browser with a completely different dataset and history from the rest of their digital life. </p>\n<p>OpenAI already has a standalone app that has context, Claude Code most likely will expand beyond just developer focus tooling at some point, and Gemini has the luxury of just being a fun update for their existing Chrome users.</p>\n<p>Last vent/ramble. That tweet thread with the CEO back in Jan where he hinted that Arc would be positioned more as Enterprise\u2026.yeah. No fucking way. No idea who your target demographic of a company is for that, but as a security leader, you\u2019re not going to ever get approval from Eng/Legal/Sec on that. Too many enterprise tooling and expectations of patching will never allow for it, and it would arguably piss off a lot of employees as Arc while awesome..I\u2019d argue is a bit too complex for older folks/less savvy to ramp up on.</p>\n<p>Alright, I feel better now. Hopefully Dia never leaves preview and gets abandoned in the next few months, at which point Arc is the priority and they can figure out better monetization options beyond trying to target Enterprise. </p>",

However, Zen lacks key features like DRM support and tab folders, making it not quite ready to replace Arc yet. Excited for Zen\u2019s future!</p>\n<p>I know that when TBC announced their new browser, many people (including myself) jumped ship. In my experience, Arc (on Mac) is an incredibly polished product that really does what it sets out to accomplish, and it does it very well. </p>\n<p>I spent much time with the Zen browser and its new beta, which was officially released today. Zen is amazing. It's Firefox-based, so the AD block works great. Better privacy and more customization. I love the idea of community-driven mods. I love that it's more customizable in the way that you can have everything, including the URL in your sidebar or not whatever you choose. It's open source, unlike Arc, and the devs actually listen very well to feedback and are constable making real changes to better the product. Currently, to my knowledge (I could be wrong), Zen lacks DRM-support for Mac and Windows, which is a deal breaker for me. It also lacks tab folders. Being able to rename your tabs without a 3rd party extension. Closing all your tabs at once is a small feature in Arc that I use all the time. The sidebar font size is small and not easily adjustable (I have bad eyes). Lots of little things that will certainly get worked out. </p>\n<p>I also understand that Zen is a much smaller team, vs Arc which was a larger team backed with more money and dev time i totally understand that and it is not a knock to the Zen time at all. I want Zen to succeed, and I will be on Team Zen! But right now, in a working person's workflow, Arc is just better (for now) I don't have the luxury of working through bugs and reporting them. I know others enjoy that more power to you. </p>\n<p>All that being said, Arc is not perfect, and its future is unknown. But for right now, Arc does what it does better than the rest (for now). I would like to see the day when Zen is going to replacement is just not there yet. I know it will be, and I will be in their corner waiting to switch! </p>\n<p>Let me know what you all think about Zen and your experience.</p>",

Closing them does nothing and I literally have to re-open the entire browser for it to respond again. I have never experienced this on any other browser and these things happen so many times they add up over time and they got me wondering why I'm still using Arc - probably because replacing browsers is a hassle.</p>\n<p>I have a good PC too so it's not anything like that (7800X3D, 4080 Super, 64GB ram). No idea. If anyone has a similar experience on the Windows version and has any tips to share I'd love to hear it and try it out, otherwise if this keeps happening I'm gonna have to switch back to something else... really disappointing performance by this browser.</p>",

The icon changed to a B for some reason (I'll provide screenshots of the odd new looks), and the home menu ui looks completely different. My first thought was it glitched and it updated to an unreleased version of Arc that was being tested; another thought was maybe it gave me a Beta update, but I\u2019m not on beta testing mode, so I shouldn't be getting Beta updates. I'll show you images of the things I've found as of now. Also, the only Arc MAX feature that shows up is \"ChatGPT in the Command Bar,\" and all the rest are gone. I think it might be a glitch, and from my findings and screenshots what seemed to be changed in this 9.9.0 update is a complete home menu UI change, Perplexity-like AI Search engine whenever you search something, an AI chat for in-website questions, horizontal tabs for some reason, new icon, pretty much every Max features removed, new 'Boost' login thing. Oh yea...

Boooy was I in for a treat.</p>\n<p>So what did happen suddenly?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I had my side/tab bar neatly organized, with the url/title in there, the settings and extention icons very conveniently available from the left hand side; under there was a selection of pinned apps and websites+folders;</li>\n<li>The url/title is back in the middle now, turning the full screen experience into a shithole experience; also I have two pairs of chrome extension icons in my tab bar and in my title bar on the right, because I probably need two pairs, just in case I lose one.</li>\n<li>Folders are a thing of the past, website organisation seems to be as well. Good thing I moved my bookmark organisation to <a href=\"http://raindrop.io\">raindrop.io</a> before all of this </li>\n<li>What the heck is this \"Ask a question\" bar that is so ugly blocking the bottom edge of the screen? That is a whole lot of white space it occupies, how the top and bottom margin doesnt align, how you lack the possibility to MAKE IT DISAPPEAR...</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What the hell happened? Did everyone at TBC jump ship? Finished the data mining?</p>\n<p>Honestly, I don't even want Arc back at this point. I did my homework while Arc was showing the first signs of acting up (CPU spikes for no reason, random breaking bugs for vital websites, the telemetry and data privacy affairs..) and decided to have Zen Browser and SigmaOS as alternatives on my MacBook Pro</p>\n<p>I can recommend both, although SigmaOS (despite the shitty name) is running like butter on Mac and has a slight better resemblance of Arc. Zen Browser is a nice project with a lot of nice perks and Firefox as basis but the migration (as of now) is not as smooth.</p>\n<p>Judging from the reactions in this sub and my own emotional outbursts, this is a turning point for Arc. It was good while it lasted. All the best</p>",

If you're looking for the most private Chromium experience, and you're not ready to give up on the speed/feeling of  Chromium, you should go with Ungoogled Chromium.  </p>\n<p>Ungoogled Chromium is open source, and is exactly like Chrome, but  without all the Google spyware, which makes it extremely private. And  it's much, much faster than Chrome and Arc, because your browser doesn't need to make 400 API calls to Google servers everytime you launch the <br />\nbrowser.  </p>\n<p>2) Z3n Browser. If you want something similar to Arc, but once again you want something open source and private, with an insanely dedicated developer who listens to user feedback, this is the move. It's running  on the same engine as Firefox.  </p>\n<p>You'll find spaces, the \"peek function\", vertical tabs, etc. And  it's open source so you know for sure your browsing history isn't  getting recorded by Arc without your consent.

Instead, it\u2019s an early research and development project designed to test ideas and get insights to shape the direction of their second product. Think of Number 10 as a temporary, experimental prototype\u2014not a preview of the next official product.</p>\n<p><strong>Why Was Number 10 Created?</strong></p>\n<p>The company used Number 10 to explore different concepts, features, and designs. By letting a small group of people use and test this prototype, they gathered feedback on what might work well and what needs improvement. However, Number 10 is not the final product, nor will it be released as one. It\u2019s part of an experimental phase to see what features might fit in future projects.</p>\n<p><strong>About the Beta Testing Program</strong></p>\n<p>The beta testing phase for Number 10 is now closed, and there will be no new opportunities to join. All current users who participated in the test will eventually transition off this experimental browser as the company wraps up this phase of development.</p>\n<p><strong>What\u2019s Next?</strong></p>\n<p>The team is taking the insights from Number 10 and using them to build a more polished, complete product that will be tailored to a larger audience. While there\u2019s no set launch date for this next product, they\u2019re working to make it something truly innovative based on what they learned from this research.</p>\n<p>To put it simply, Number 10 is not the upcoming product. It was a tool for the company to test new ideas and will not be part of any official launch. Any screenshots, features, or comments about Number 10 reflect the experimental nature of this prototype, not the design of the actual product they are creating.</p>\n<p><strong>Common Questions You Might Have:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cIf Number 10 is just an experiment, why did it seem like it was being marketed?\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To get accurate and honest feedback, the team needed users to feel they were testing a realistic product, not just a \u201csandbox\u201d or trial environment. This way, testers\u2019 reactions, likes, and dislikes were more authentic, helping the team see what might work in an actual product.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cWill any of the things I saw in media posts or screenshots be in the final product?\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It\u2019s possible, but not guaranteed. Features like horizontal tabs or an AI chatbot were part of the experimental design, and their inclusion in the final product will depend on what feedback and results came from the test.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cIs Number 10 the new Arc 2.0?

The beta testing program for Number 10 has closed, and there\u2019s no download available for it anymore. While the company will continue to build on its insights, Number 10 itself won\u2019t become a public product.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cHow do I know that everything I just read isn't a lie and just some slop to make me stop investigating\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You don't, but being who I am within this community, I assume one can believe that I have communicated with the browser company before (<a href=\"https://x.com/JaceThings/status/1796209880782520783\">I've even been to their office</a>) and have semi-quick contact with them, and managing this community has been getting harder based off of not knowing what is and what isn't true, so I reached out for a comment. If you still do not believe me, fair enough, you can wait and see what's going to happen just like the non-members of this community.</p>\n<p>If any of you have any other specific questions, please ask in the comments and I'll try my best to answer them within reason and respect.</p>\n<p>Thanks everyone.</p>",

I feel you guys must mostly agree with that if you\u2019re a part of this sub. </p>\n<p>Now the CEO announces that they are focusing on another project because Arc is essentially feature complete and most of you are acting like the sky is falling, making vast and wild assumptions about TBC and the founder that ring more as negative speculation than potentially accurate. </p>\n<p>Arc is a lovely product for me, as an internet power user. But I can already tell from trying to convince friends to jump onboard with it in the last two weeks that it\u2019s not really a mainstream product. </p>\n<p>If TBC feels that they want to release a new browser experience thats more mainstream I am in full support. Thank god they\u2019re not going the route of updating Arc one day to a completely different, more streamlined experience but instead they are creating something completely new and different. I personally am very excited to try it. </p>\n<p>The negative bandwagoning of Reddit culture is exhausting. Why is everyone so up in arms? You\u2019re acting like Chrome and Safari haven\u2019t essentially been just releasing stability and performance improvements for the last decade. </p>\n<p>Is anyone else just happy with Arc and also excited to see what else they\u2019re cooking up?</p>",

It's in the title. How do you drop support for the thing that's in your name, that you've been saying you built the entire company to do, and instead just go off and do some other AI bullshit?</p>\n<p>Arc Search on mobile seems to be doing... alright I guess. But Perplexity is pumping out free trials for Pro like there's no tomorrow (all Comcast customers get a <em>full year</em> of free Pro). Every company under the sun is trying and has so far failed to turn LLMs into things that can \"think\" or be \"agentic\" or whatever the fuck, and every single one of them has failed to make a compelling product that is a sustainable business that won't crumple the minute Microsoft or AWS start charging normal prices for compute (instead of the rate we have now that is slashed in half).</p>\n<p>I also do not know a single person (parents, grandparents, people who are bad with tech) that I would recommend use AI shit. They are too confused by technology to be able to know to check the LLM's outputs because every single goddamn piece of generative AI technology CAN JUST LIE TO YOU. IT MAKES UP BULLSHIT. And yes, that includes the Whisper model that just does transcription (apparently at medical institutions it is hallucinating racist shit into transcriptions of patient / doctor interactions). If you give something to people that don't understand tech and that talks authoritatively about stuff, it's going to go bad. Really bad. </p>\n<p>Also why would I want an LLM interacting with my websites for me?? In what world would I ever want that? </p>\n<p>Think about it for a second. My browser has direct access to the most private and sensitive information about me. Emails. Messages. Bank account details. All of my social media. In order to automate use of a browser with AI, you're going to have to ship the web page off to a server somewhere because there are currently no local LLM models that can interact with a fucking browser lmao. So what happens if I let this LLM navigate my browser for me, and it accidentally for some reason sends off my bank account number, or my social security number, or my emails, or my texts, anything (just by accident) to one of these services? Those outputs are <em>absolutely</em> going to be used to train the next models (despite what these companies might claim) and they're for sure going to be stored somewhere. That sounds like a security and privacy nightmare. </p>\n<p>Nobody wants this. Nobody is asking for this. The technology to automate a browser is currently and (for the foreseeable future) will not be there because it is not cost effective and the LLMs are EXTREMELY bad at anything that isn't basic summarization. Claude's new computer use model boils an ocean every five seconds because in order to work it has to analyze huge screenshot on your computer and count the # of pixels it needs to click on stuff. That is not cost effective and there is no world in which it magically becomes so. Rabbit tried (and failed) to do it via the accessibility tree for Android and Windows apps. There have been multiple other browser extensions and AI startups who try to automate browser use and absolutely nobody uses them because they all suck, get stuck in a loop, or lie to you. </p>",

YouTube Embeds, Verified Quotes, and all!</p>\n<p>https://reddit.com/link/1adfb2f/video/rs080dv7d9fc1/player</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>third, we designed the most delightful, fluid way to quickly toggle between multiple webpages.</p>\n<p>easily flick your way around multiple product pages or restaurant reviews without thinking.</p>\n<p>https://reddit.com/link/1adfb2f/video/wzr6xaobd9fc1/player</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>hh, and we wouldn\u2019t be the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/browsercompany\">@browsercompany</a> if we didn\u2019t cleanup your tabs every night: </p>\n<p>we auto-archive the junk so you can START FRESH every single morning. </p>\n<p>which brings me to my last point: what about Arc for Desktop? where\u2019s the sync experience?</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>now that Arc is on Windows we need to move off iCloud. So we\u2019re rolling our own cross-platform syncing experience.</p>\n<p>it will be called \u201cArc Anywhere\u201d \u2014 and it\u2019s almost done.</p>\n<p>as soon as it is, you\u2019ll be able to instantly sync tabs between this app and Arc on Mac/Windows.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>when \u201cArc Anywhere\u201d is finished, it will also \u2014 of course \u2014 sync all of your Spaces, Pinned Tabs, etc. to Arc Search as well.  </p>\n<p>Basically, we\u2019ll drop the \u201cSearch\u201d word from this app name and turn it into a full-fledged \u201cArc\u201d app on your iPhone (in the coming month or two). soon!</p>",

Arc fixes that, with their own animation, and its smooth.\n\u00b0Extension support: more of chromium extension work as they should like ublock origin etc.\n\u00b0Color shit : Some people may experience color shift while entering exiting full screen on YouTube or other streaming sites on arc, Actually its a chromium problem for hardware acceleration i.e GPU acceleration, its even present on Chrome. It's easy to fix.</p>\n<p>Currently windows version is in very early stage i.e CBT and isn't suitable for daily use. It lacks even some basic features for now, like bookmarks etc. It just feels like a Skeleton for now. But it's heading in right direction. It will get better.\nLet me know if you have any questions..</p><div><br></div><img src=\"https://i.redd.it/vs9bkuxo02ec1.png\" />",
