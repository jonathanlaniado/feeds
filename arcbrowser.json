This is freaking huge for me.<br />\n- Split-screen mode is SO MUCH BETTER than multiple tabs<br />\n- The keyboard shortcuts are so useful. If you learn a few of them you'll be superpowered.

I've been a loyal Firefox user since forever, but Arc finally gave me enough reason to switch.</p>\n<p>I've made a list of the most important bugs / feature requests that I repeatedly notice in my workflow. Some of these could resonate with the wider audience as well. Sharing them here in case the team is looking for feedback. I've tagged them with priorities (P0 &gt; P1 &gt; P2) to convey their relative importance.  </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Address bar</strong></li>\n<li>When you type a partial url and start updating it by removing some components at the end. Pressing enter takes you to the original url instead of the edited one. Suggestions should not take precedence if user has edited the url. <code>(P0)</code></li>\n<li>Arc overrides the natural behaviour of Opt + Left, Opt + Right, Opt + Delete (jumping only a single world) when working with the hostname part of a url, which gets treated as a single word. Sometimes one just needs to make minor changes to the hostname like changing the TLD or subdomain. <code>(P1)</code></li>\n<li><strong>Picture in picture</strong></li>\n<li>Ability to seek using arrow keys when PiP window is in focus. <code>(P0)</code></li>\n<li>Give an option to start PiP without switching tabs, e.g. by showing an icon on hover like Firefox does, or using a hot key. The most common use-case is when you're switching between apps, or scrolling through comments on the same page. And it's also useful for viewing videos on Instagram, YT shorts, etc. which don't show you video controls - PiP works as a nice hack to change that behaviour. <code>(P1)</code></li>\n<li>Double click could possibly maximise the player instead of opening the playing tab as there's already a \"Back to Tab\" option on hover for that. <code>(P2)</code></li>\n<li>Subtitles / CC support if the original player has them. <code>(P2)</code></li>\n<li>Seek and back / forward are missing on some streams, such as Netflix. <code>(P2)</code></li>\n<li><strong>Arc Max</strong></li>\n<li>No way to do regular search with Cmd + F when Ask page feature is enabled. That should not override a common browser shortcut. It should use a variation like long-pressing Cmd + F, or a different shortcut like Cmd + Shift + F. <code>(P0)</code></li>\n<li>No way to undo rename of tab title, like there is for undoing file rename. <code>(P2)</code></li>\n<li><strong>Sync</strong></li>\n<li>After installing Arc on a new laptop, sync behaved unexpectedly: <code>(P1)</code><ul>\n<li>Default space and bookmarks got created even though I was an existing user who had logged in.</li>\n<li>My existing spaces and profiles did not appear at first and there was no visual feedback to convey they weren't synced yet, so I ended up recreating them manually.</li>\n<li>The pinned / favourites section was missing in one of the spaces (space 2), and some favourites from space 2 were added in space 1.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Bookmarks</strong></li>\n<li>Pinned section is fine, but I still miss having bookmarks that are tucked away somewhere they won't add visual noise. The main feature of bookmarks for me is auto-completion in the address bar. Firefox allows filtering suggestions specific to bookmarks, history, page titles, etc by typing a symbol (such as * for bookmark) in the address bar. Something like that would be great in Arc. <code>(P1)</code></li>\n<li><strong>Developer Tools / Mode</strong></li>\n<li>Two finger swipe to go back / forward doesn't work sometimes. I've mostly noticed this when developer mode is enabled. <code>(P0)</code></li>\n<li>A keyboard shortcut for Network tab would be great. Firefox supports this (Cmd + Opt + E) but Chrome and related browsers don't. It's one of the most used dev tools for both backend and frontend engineers. I currently enable developer mode for a site to access it with one click. <code>(P1)</code></li>\n<li>A setting / hotkey to enable developer mode globally would be useful instead of having to toggle it on specific websites. <code>(P2)</code></li>\n<li>Ability to edit and resend requests from Network tab. Not sure how feasible this is in Chromium-based browsers, but FF supports this. <code>(P2)</code></li>\n<li><strong>Settings</strong></li>\n<li>There should be a way to access advanced / Chromium settings (arc://settings) from settings window. <code>(P2)</code></li>\n<li><strong>Error / negative response caching</strong></li>\n<li>Sometimes if I receive a non-200 response or chromium error page in a tab, it cannot be refreshed any way - Reload / Force Reload / Clear Cookies. This persists even if you change the URL of the tab and try navigating to a different page. <code>(P1)</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If any of these resonate with you, please comment to highlight their importance to the Arc team. Feel free to post your suggestions in this thread as well.</p>",

Thank you</p>\n<p>AI in browser is something I wanted for a long time and never knew why wouldn't browsers implement it because it has so much potential.</p>\n<p>As a web developer my time and focus are really of the essence. I've been using browser extension that summaries page, and it's been game changing for me. Seeing it in the browser really makes me happy.</p>\n<p>Enhancing Find (command + f) is a really really smart idea. Let's just enhance existing feature without altering it's default behaviour, and not bring in new one with new shortcut. I love it.</p>\n<p>Link previews are nice for specific use case. I personally don't find it useful, but I can see how good can it be for some people.</p>\n<p>Tidy tab titles are great but I'd personally would like to rename tab by pressing right click on it and then rename it with AI, since it would be more useful, because I don't want my pinned to have 15 pinned tabs. Actually I don't use pinned tabs at all :)</p>\n<p>GPT in command bar is not as useful as I want it to be, since tab with GPT is in my favourites, and is accessible with one click, instead of doing 3 keys combo.</p>\n<p>MAX has been getting some backlashes, and that is understandable. Every new product, idea or feature will get bad critics. It is also understandable that they hit limit on Open AI, hell, even Open AI hit limits with Open AI when ChatGPT first came out. I don't think hitting limit is a bad programming or bad QA. With that logic ChatGPT is bad programming and QA, which we can definitely say IT IS NOT.</p>\n<p>I also think that guys from Browser Company are great. They've been so open about their work, funding, future, past, everything they've been doing, and that really makes me feel like part of their team. I've been using Arc as my main browser since beta, and couldn't change it under no circumstances.</p>\n<p>Anyway, this was just my take on features and stuff that have been happening lately. I know how reddit can be harsh and toxic, and if you don't like something there is toggle to turn it off, and it will be like it never existed.</p>\n<p>Happy Wednesday everyone</p>",

Waiting 6 months to only get here feels very disappointing, especially when they made a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/joshm/status/1666821015585058822?s=46&amp;t=kA-7VIXPVHFu8R42AtK4Vw\">big deal</a> about spending the time to make it proper, and still ended up with a worse version of SigmaOS\u2019s.</p></div>",

I create some spaces like general/focus/chill, but it turns out that whenever i open arc, the first thing i do is not to think about which space should the tab that i want to open goes to; instead, i just put it wherever i am. And also, when im already in \u201cfocus\u201d space for a long time for example, and suddenly i have this very cool \u201cchilling\u201d idea, the first thing i would do is not to switch to \u201cchill\u201d space; instead the first reaction is always to open a new tab using my very handy shortcut whichever space im in. So in the end, the thing is always that one space gets especially crowded but the others are mostly empty because im too lazy to switch spaces or maybe this design is just anti-human. I dont know if anyone has similar experiences with me. But i still love the idea of grouping different tabs into separate spaces.</p></div>",

This way, we could disable or enable certain profiles (or spaces), depending on the Focus mode we are in. I would love to disable my casual space when I am at work, so that I get less distracted.</p></div>",
