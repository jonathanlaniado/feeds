YouTube Embeds, Verified Quotes, and all!</p>\n<p>https://reddit.com/link/1adfb2f/video/rs080dv7d9fc1/player</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>third, we designed the most delightful, fluid way to quickly toggle between multiple webpages.</p>\n<p>easily flick your way around multiple product pages or restaurant reviews without thinking.</p>\n<p>https://reddit.com/link/1adfb2f/video/wzr6xaobd9fc1/player</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>hh, and we wouldn\u2019t be the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/browsercompany\">@browsercompany</a> if we didn\u2019t cleanup your tabs every night: </p>\n<p>we auto-archive the junk so you can START FRESH every single morning. </p>\n<p>which brings me to my last point: what about Arc for Desktop? where\u2019s the sync experience?</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>now that Arc is on Windows we need to move off iCloud. So we\u2019re rolling our own cross-platform syncing experience.</p>\n<p>it will be called \u201cArc Anywhere\u201d \u2014 and it\u2019s almost done.</p>\n<p>as soon as it is, you\u2019ll be able to instantly sync tabs between this app and Arc on Mac/Windows.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>when \u201cArc Anywhere\u201d is finished, it will also \u2014 of course \u2014 sync all of your Spaces, Pinned Tabs, etc. to Arc Search as well.  </p>\n<p>Basically, we\u2019ll drop the \u201cSearch\u201d word from this app name and turn it into a full-fledged \u201cArc\u201d app on your iPhone (in the coming month or two). soon!</p>",

Arc fixes that, with their own animation, and its smooth.\n\u00b0Extension support: more of chromium extension work as they should like ublock origin etc.\n\u00b0Color shit : Some people may experience color shift while entering exiting full screen on YouTube or other streaming sites on arc, Actually its a chromium problem for hardware acceleration i.e GPU acceleration, its even present on Chrome. It's easy to fix.</p>\n<p>Currently windows version is in very early stage i.e CBT and isn't suitable for daily use. It lacks even some basic features for now, like bookmarks etc. It just feels like a Skeleton for now. But it's heading in right direction. It will get better.\nLet me know if you have any questions..</p><div><br></div><img src=\"https://i.redd.it/vs9bkuxo02ec1.png\" />",

Masses of beta versions, even more bugs, \"weird\" UX practices that were then changed, revisited again, then thrown out again. </p>\n<p>Added a ton of fiddly stuff - two versions of split view, PiP, ubiquitous CMD+T, sneak peek, MAX, Boosts, folders, screenshots (with or without desktop wallpaper), folder sharing, quote page sharing. </p>\n<p>All these add-ons are great, but do they really need to load right from chromium, which is mega resource-intensive anyway? </p>\n<p>Can't they be moved to some \"gallery\", where the user can decide for himself whether he actually needs it and possibly disable it?</p>\n<p>There are so many of these built-in capabilities that the average user, who hits at least from Firefox, gets a headache from the sheer number of \"extra\" things.</p>\n<p>If there are so many super things, why am I sick of Arc?</p>\n<p>Well, it's because the team has been so focused on shoving in all the possible fiches that can be crammed in, that they have forgotten about users who, for example, don't have 16GB of ram and an 8-core CPU.... </p>\n<p>I have an iMac in the highest configuration - there Arc works (almost)super, while on a year-old MacBook Air (basic variant), there is drama. Battery drain, boot time are dramatic. Has the problem been reported? Plenty of times. </p>\n<p>Why doesn't it work super on the iMac? Errors. I am a developer, my work tool is console, devTools, etc. Once opened devTools (not always, but in 90% of cases) it can't be closed afterwards, in a while. Ha! The whole tab can't be closed. Has the topic been reported? At least 5 times. Silence. Suspending PiP? Reported plenty of times. Synchronization with iCloud that takes 3 days? Yes. </p>\n<p>Closing information about the possibility of translating a particular site (with the option that THIS particular site should not be translated)? Just refresh and the message appears again. </p>\n<p>Google Meet. 3 people + screen sharing. Temperature? 70 degrees celsius (158F). Seriously...</p>\n<p>Somewhere, someone wrote that it's more fun to write about adding new featrues than about optimization. Perhaps. But I'm just using the browser for work, and I'm depending on 100% assurance that nothing will crash while I'm working. </p>\n<p>They are dealing with \"Act2\" now. What for? Why start painting a house if the walls continue to wobble? Too bad. A great pity, because I was really rooting for them with this project. But it's strange to look at a startup that selectively fixes some fuck-ups or adds a feature to take screenshots, but doesn't address things that actually affect the user experience. <br />\nAI everywhere. MAX, immediately opening 5 selected search results from Google. Seriously? Then maybe let's make just one popup for typing at all: \"Find ramen recipe\" and that's it! AI will generate a shopping list for us, download pictures of the recipe, call mom and buy bowls on Amazon.... It will do everything for us. We're getting an all-in-one combo. And I don't think I like the direction they are taking. What we're getting from the \"new Internet\" is Minority Report. I think I'll stand and wait for now. </p>\n<p>Quo Vadis, Arc?</p>",

You might remember seeing this ad on YouTube around that time: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roAp7TcOZuA\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roAp7TcOZuA</a></p>\n<p>I remember TBC talked about acquiring a company a while ago, and I believe this company was Cake Browser, as according to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cake_Browser\">Wikipedia</a>, They quietly shut down in 2022 and starting in January of 2023, their website now redirects to Arc's (go to <a href=\"http://www.cakebrowser.com/\">http://www.cakebrowser.com/</a>). In TBC's most recent youtube video talking about their announcement on Jan 30, they preview a demo of fetching the top links from a search engine like google and adding them as new tabs on your sidebar. This is basically Cake's premise, but for desktop. That leads me to the new \"Arc Browser 2.0\" for iOS that TBC is giving out to certain people for testing via TestFlight (perhaps a version of \"Blue\", their mobile demo from a while ago). I'm wondering if this browser will be similar to the Cake Browser, but with more Arc features and TBC polish. Thoughts?</p>",

I love most of its features - love the tiling mechanism, peek on links, Arc Max features, Little Arc, and the newest feature where we can search chatgpt directly from the new tab dialog box.  </p>\n<p>I guess they even added a functionality on my request - separate tab switching carousel for each space, and that just makes this browser even more special for me.  </p>\n<p>But the only thing I do not like is that it is a memory hog. The fact that this is based on chromium is most noticeable because of this behaviour to be honest. I am a CS student, so naturally have a lot of tabs open by default, using multiple web-apps from the sidebar and have vscode permanently open, with other utilities like Terminal/Warp, Obsidian, Preview and Spotify opened 80% of the time. So in most cases the memory consumption reaches 12GBs (very rarely exceeds that). But sometimes when Arc browser has been left opened for a long time (days) it sits on a lot of memory, which leads to bottlenecking and has led to swap usage (once). I tried shifting to Safari, but did not find it as comfortable as it lacked a lot of useful features.  </p>\n<p>The Arc team might be planning to shift from the chromium foundation to webkit (which is known for resource efficiency, eg: Safari, Orion) or an entirely new web engine in the long run (idk, #speculation), but starting with a little attention to the resource efficiency might be a good idea. Edge was also a chromium based browser, but they focussed on its memory aspect and now it is a solid competition to chrome for this. </p>",

But we don't need a web browser, we have web-browsers. We need what comes next\"</strong><br />\nNO, people certainly didn't think that these browsers are good, or good enough. your whole slogan is \"the chrome replacement...\".<br />\nArc should focus on being a \"GOOD WEB BROWSER\" and focus on the core fundamentals of the browser and make them better.<br />\nonce your focus is on adding more and more things other than the core of being good browser, you start becoming bloated and slow. <br />\nBuild a good web browser, fix bugs, make it truly cross platform first and stable (Windows, Linux, Android).<br />\nEvery Arc review I've seen, said pretty much is what attracted them to arc is taking the core fundamental ideas of web browser and change the way we use it. not inventing \"WHAT COMES NEXT\"</li>\n<li><strong>\"The internet is gonna come to you\"</strong><br />\nWhat the video showed here, is the idea of instead of googling something you just type it, and arc automatically opens 5 tabs for you.<br />\nSo... it's just \"I'm feeling lucky\" on Google but more tabs, because I don't feel that lucky!<br />\nand I don't like this because of the same reason me and others don't use I'm feeling lucky. <br />\nit's not that it doesn't work, it works really well actually. but it's that sense of control.<br />\nI don't want my browser to open 5 tabs for me. I want to choose what I open based on the title and the websites that I like.<br />\nAlso, as someone pointed out, sometimes we use google as an address book, like typing a website name to go to, instead of typing the URL because we are lazy. and I want to add to that, google image search, google video search, google news search. you can't replace that with the whole 5 tabs idea.</li>\n<li><strong>\"We wanna build like a new computer\"</strong><br />\nSo... a Chromebook?, the whole idea of the browser being your computer and a platform by itself and relying on like webapps, is the core idea being ChromeOS.<br />\nAnd if that what the company wants to do, forking ChromiumOS and replace chromium with arc browser, thus creating ARCOS, I'm all for it.<br />\nBut again, this has been done before. and I think the focus now should be on making arc better and cross platform, improving the core browser instead of spreading too thin.</li>\n<li><strong>\"Ai software\"</strong><br />\nIt feels from this video, that Arc's focus on ai, is only gonna increase more and more from this point onwards. Which scares me tbh.<br />\nI don't want my browser to be bloated or to be that million ai tools that does things automatically for me.<br />\nThat's why the first thing I do on edge is disabling copilot and all the automation thingys.<br />\nThis point is more personal and that's why I made it the last point, as people might like an AI BROWSER, but I really don't like this approach and I feel like it distracts from the core function of a browser.</li>\n</ol>",

Sure, the announcement for Arc for Windows gave some people false hope. But \u2014and this is my personal opinion\u2014 I feel like people who want everything and want it right now simply don't understand how this project works.</p>\n<p>Everyone here has a (tiny) role in creating the browsing experience of the future. It's actually incredible how much TBC is paying attention to what is said here. They are really passionate about their product and building something we will love. Let's help them by giving them constructive feedback instead of just moaning about what the difference is between an alpha or beta release, whether Josh should be less enthusiastic in his announcements, or that GDPR misunderstanding. </p>\n<p>Being a little nicer to each other doesn't cost anything, but it makes life much better for the people who are actually building the product we so desperately want to use.</p>",

Send this via iMessage or Twitter!</p>\n<p>\u2022 Little Arc Windows now auto-archive every 6 hours by default. You can edit this setting in Arc &gt; Settings &gt; General.

But corporate incentives hold back our internet more than we know.  If you\u2019re a reporter, go ask Google directly: \u201cDo you ship new features to Chrome if people LOVE them but they hurt search query volume in testing?\u201d  The answer is NO!</p>\n<p>The point is not that making money is bad. It\u2019s that if we  can break free from Google's grip on the Web, a more wondrous, creative internet life is waiting for us.  It\u2019s time to shake things up. It\u2019s time to move beyond Google.

It is \u26a1\ufe0f2x faster to use ChatGPT in Arc than in other browsers \u26a1\ufe0f (we counted the clicks).</p>\n<p>One final point: the fastest, easiest way to use ChatGPT on your computer didn\u2019t even take AI (or anything fancy) to pull off\u2026  </p>\n<p>Just a human-centric approach to having YOUR back on the Internet, instead of optimizing for Search Ads.  Now imagine what\u2019s possible WITH AI\u2026 \ud83d\ude43</p>\n<p>Now dream with us:</p>\n<p>If we freed our internet from optimizing for Search Ads, where would you want your browser to take you or do for you when you ask it for something new?  </p>\n<p>We\u2019ll prototype your favorite ideas internally and share what we learn!</p>\n<p>P.S. shoutout to the one-and-only <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jasdev\">@jasdev</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dustin\">@dustin</a> for bringing this to life, was an inspired project</p>\n<p>\u2013 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/joshm\"><strong>Josh Miller</strong></a> <strong>(</strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/joshm\">@joshm</a>) via X</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/joshm/thread/1729870181911204308\">https://twitter.com/joshm/thread/1729870181911204308</a></p>",

That is a super simplistic way of determining whether or not Arc is good at memory management.  For example, just go and use Safari and you'll notice that it uses a lot of memory, but what you will also notice is that your memory pressure on the machine is much lower than it is with Arc or some other browser. Not even Edge can touch it.  </p>\n<p>But there are times when people will post that Arc sucks with memory use but when I look at the screen shot of their activity monitor I see that it's actually not doing a bad job.
