            "content_html": "<p>I gave it my best shot. I tried using Dia yesterday at launch out of curiosity. Maybe they focused on it for a reason? Perhaps it was truly a better browser? I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt since ARC literally changed my life and how I interact with the internet. Well, after about an hour and a half of using it, and I use \u201cusing\u201d very loosely here, I cannot for the life of me figure out what in the hell this product is meant to do other than overcomplicate and annoy me. Nothing about the UI/UX makes any sense, nor do any of the recommended use cases. They didn\u2019t even port over THE ONE THING THAT MADE ARC AMAZING: SPACES AND SIDEBAR NAVIGATION WITH TABS AND PINS. This is what is known as a \u201cproduct for no one that no one asked for and solves only made up problems that do not exist.\u201d There is absolutely no reason that they could not have built DIA into ARC itself from what I can tell, and they even seemed to be on the path to doing so with some of their actually kinda usable AI features in ARC. Confounding business decision that seems to be based on solely being able to generate new hype for a new product as opposed to making an old and supremely viable product better. Very disappointed to say the least. I don\u2019t want to pile on the people who made the product because I am sure they are working very hard to make it good, but the executive team at TBC needs a good slap upside the head and whichever investors invariably pushed them into this decision should be removed from the cap table. Ugh.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>I don't usually post on Reddit (mostly a lurker), but the recent discussions around Arc's maintenance mode and Dia have been... intense. Figured I'd share my perspective as someone who actually uses these tools for work.</p>\n<h1>My Arc Journey</h1>\n<p>As an AI researcher, my workflow involves juggling dozens of tabs, dev tools, inspection panels, and resource-heavy websites. Before Arc, I was bouncing between Brave and Firefox like everyone else. Arc's vertical tab management was a revelation \u2013 once my brain recalibrated to it, my productivity genuinely improved.</p>\n<p>Since I don't have a Mac, I've only used Arc on Windows. Here's how much I loved Arc: I'm an Arch Linux user of several years, but I kept a Windows partition <em>specifically</em> for Arc. That's right \u2013 I dual-booted just to use this browser, despite Windows Arc being a second-class citizen with missing features compared to the Mac version. On my main Arch setup, I've been using Zen as the closest Arc alternative, so I had a pretty good sense of where both browsers stood.</p>\n<h1>The Maintenance Mode Reality Check</h1>\n<p>I wasn't following this subreddit closely, but I <em>felt</em> something was off. Arc became a memory hog, increasingly buggy, and frankly annoying to use daily. So I switched to Zen across all my machines before I even knew about the maintenance announcement.</p>\n<p>When I finally stumbled into this subreddit and learned Arc was being sunset, I was baffled. Sure, it's niche \u2013 vertical tabs aren't exactly normie-friendly (trust me, I've tried converting people). But for those of us who \"got it,\" Arc <em>worked</em>. The idea that they expected it to become a mainstream browser seems like a fundamental misunderstanding of their own product.</p>\n<h1>On Dia: Promising but Problematic</h1>\n<p>The Dia concept is interesting from an AI perspective. I've started using Claude and Grok for research instead of traditional search, and there's definitely something there. LLMs can surface information in ways that feel more natural than parsing through search results.</p>\n<p>But here's the problem: you're adding another layer of filtering between users and information. How do you trust a model trained by a company to remain unbiased? It's a valid concern, especially when that model becomes your primary information gateway.</p>\n<p>Realistically, I don't see Dia going mainstream. Big Tech has the resources to offer expensive AI features for free until competitors suffocate. We've seen this playbook before.</p>\n<p>Plus, The Browser Company is setting themselves up for a brutal squeeze from LLM providers. They'll either get crushed by API costs as they scale, or they'll have to invest massive resources into building their own models \u2013 something that requires Google/OpenAI-level capital and talent.</p>\n<h1>The Bigger Picture</h1>\n<p>This feels like classic CEO-user disconnect. Arc had captured a specific market (power users, developers, researchers) with virtually no competition. Instead of doubling down on that strength, they pivoted to chase a broader market that probably never wanted what they were selling anyway.</p>\n<p>Now I'm using Zen, which isn't perfect \u2013 it's buggy, incomplete, very much a work in progress. But with Arc's exit, it's likely to get more contributors and attention.</p>\n<p>Once again, open source outlasts the venture capital darling.</p>\n<h1>Edit: TL;DR for my lazy friends</h1>\n<p>TL;DR: Loved Arc so much I kept Windows just to use it (I'm an Arch user). Switched to Zen when Arc got buggy, then found out about maintenance mode. Dia pivot makes no business sense - they're abandoning a working niche product to chase mainstream users who don't want vertical tabs, while setting themselves up to get crushed by LLM API costs or Big Tech competition. Classic CEO disconnect. Open source (Zen) wins again.</p>",

It was exciting.</p>\n<p>Fast forward to now, and it feels like a completely different story.</p>\n<p>All we get are Chromium security patches. The Windows version? Miles behind macOS \u2014 and honestly, it should never have been released to the public in the state it was. That moment was when I really started feeling like they stopped caring. What once felt like a browser built for people became a ghost of its original vision.</p>\n<p>I recently came across Zen Browser, based on Firefox, and\u2026 it\u2019s basically everything Arc was supposed to be. Smoother performance, better animations, and a design that feels polished and cared for. It captures that initial spark Arc had \u2014 except it\u2019s doing it better.</p>\n<p>Also, let\u2019s talk about how Arc makes it nearly impossible to switch \u2014 no option to export bookmarks?

Our students have used it to break down lectures, draft project docs, quiz themselves, and do things we never could have anticipated.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This should help clarify that Dia's audience is college students, whereas Arc's was for more general use cases.</p>",

I know there\u2019s been plenty of chatter around this, but it\u2019s genuinely head scratching that I had to vent here.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s 100% possible to ship this entire product as an extension. Chrome extensions 100% supports tab awareness permissions, Safari App Extensions appear to as well - which would effectively give you the \u201cpowerful\u201d browser context that Dia is supposed to be unique for. </p>\n<p>Nothing about Dia is unique. It feels like the product team got distracted by what Windsurf, Cursor, Copilot etc. all shipped and felt like it would be a good idea to do the same thing. </p>\n<p>What they seem to also be (weirdly) bullish of is the idea that the already 100s of millions of happy users on Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini would bail on their entire setup to use this bespoke desktop browser with a completely different dataset and history from the rest of their digital life. </p>\n<p>OpenAI already has a standalone app that has context, Claude Code most likely will expand beyond just developer focus tooling at some point, and Gemini has the luxury of just being a fun update for their existing Chrome users.</p>\n<p>Last vent/ramble. That tweet thread with the CEO back in Jan where he hinted that Arc would be positioned more as Enterprise\u2026.yeah. No fucking way. No idea who your target demographic of a company is for that, but as a security leader, you\u2019re not going to ever get approval from Eng/Legal/Sec on that. Too many enterprise tooling and expectations of patching will never allow for it, and it would arguably piss off a lot of employees as Arc while awesome..I\u2019d argue is a bit too complex for older folks/less savvy to ramp up on.</p>\n<p>Alright, I feel better now. Hopefully Dia never leaves preview and gets abandoned in the next few months, at which point Arc is the priority and they can figure out better monetization options beyond trying to target Enterprise. </p>",

However, Zen lacks key features like DRM support and tab folders, making it not quite ready to replace Arc yet. Excited for Zen\u2019s future!</p>\n<p>I know that when TBC announced their new browser, many people (including myself) jumped ship. In my experience, Arc (on Mac) is an incredibly polished product that really does what it sets out to accomplish, and it does it very well. </p>\n<p>I spent much time with the Zen browser and its new beta, which was officially released today. Zen is amazing. It's Firefox-based, so the AD block works great. Better privacy and more customization. I love the idea of community-driven mods. I love that it's more customizable in the way that you can have everything, including the URL in your sidebar or not whatever you choose. It's open source, unlike Arc, and the devs actually listen very well to feedback and are constable making real changes to better the product. Currently, to my knowledge (I could be wrong), Zen lacks DRM-support for Mac and Windows, which is a deal breaker for me. It also lacks tab folders. Being able to rename your tabs without a 3rd party extension. Closing all your tabs at once is a small feature in Arc that I use all the time. The sidebar font size is small and not easily adjustable (I have bad eyes). Lots of little things that will certainly get worked out. </p>\n<p>I also understand that Zen is a much smaller team, vs Arc which was a larger team backed with more money and dev time i totally understand that and it is not a knock to the Zen time at all. I want Zen to succeed, and I will be on Team Zen! But right now, in a working person's workflow, Arc is just better (for now) I don't have the luxury of working through bugs and reporting them. I know others enjoy that more power to you. </p>\n<p>All that being said, Arc is not perfect, and its future is unknown. But for right now, Arc does what it does better than the rest (for now). I would like to see the day when Zen is going to replacement is just not there yet. I know it will be, and I will be in their corner waiting to switch! </p>\n<p>Let me know what you all think about Zen and your experience.</p>",

Closing them does nothing and I literally have to re-open the entire browser for it to respond again. I have never experienced this on any other browser and these things happen so many times they add up over time and they got me wondering why I'm still using Arc - probably because replacing browsers is a hassle.</p>\n<p>I have a good PC too so it's not anything like that (7800X3D, 4080 Super, 64GB ram). No idea. If anyone has a similar experience on the Windows version and has any tips to share I'd love to hear it and try it out, otherwise if this keeps happening I'm gonna have to switch back to something else... really disappointing performance by this browser.</p>",

The icon changed to a B for some reason (I'll provide screenshots of the odd new looks), and the home menu ui looks completely different. My first thought was it glitched and it updated to an unreleased version of Arc that was being tested; another thought was maybe it gave me a Beta update, but I\u2019m not on beta testing mode, so I shouldn't be getting Beta updates. I'll show you images of the things I've found as of now. Also, the only Arc MAX feature that shows up is \"ChatGPT in the Command Bar,\" and all the rest are gone. I think it might be a glitch, and from my findings and screenshots what seemed to be changed in this 9.9.0 update is a complete home menu UI change, Perplexity-like AI Search engine whenever you search something, an AI chat for in-website questions, horizontal tabs for some reason, new icon, pretty much every Max features removed, new 'Boost' login thing. Oh yea... AND I CAN'T LOG BACK IN ;-;</p>\n<p>I don't know to flair this as 'help' or 'bug' because I don't know if this is a bug.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/kou0ho5ng3zd1.png?width=3348&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cde0d006ae5ad3a8640f2e2ff8ee19c63280b5c3\">AND THIS is the completely new menu design that I opened up to when it updated (it deleted all my old tabs, and some things are inaccessible, and some things are new).</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/c7lor9gxg3zd1.png?width=848&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ccceaa42717e95a89f7ac5ed62e75da1d3afd054\">And yea, this is the completely new version that it is at for some reason.</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/tczlskyqh3zd1.png?width=3348&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9f3ae70a4ea9e8663752eb0bfed6137b5d98ecd0\">(I am making new discoveries as I type this.) I wanted to Google something (don't judge me, I was curious about the box office), so I typed in the \\\"Search or enter URL\\\" and it randomly started getting information like on Arc Search, and it came up with an answer. This is the craziest new thing that has happened on here.</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/m93vswpwm3zd1.png?width=3348&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f211e1088a052bfb814d2fa8c6aea147eefc7f5f\">I went to Duolingo to see features on any normal website, and now this \\\"Ask a question...\\\" shows up at the bottom, and if I ask multiple questions, it will have a \\\"Back to Chat\\\" icon on the lower left.</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/9qaopwqtn3zd1.png?width=3348&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d96a0475a5a04790004f972cebca0861c5c2dd6\">This is the most cursed of them all, Arc with horizontal tabs. I don't know why, but when I pressed the sandwich icon that is supposed to make the screen size for the tabs bigger, it put all the tabs into horizontal mode.</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/c1p4fjedo3zd1.png?width=3348&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11d4298415ae241e93e92a6d87e42681dfd252c3\">This is how it looks on a blank tab.</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/f4jjf8npo3zd1.png?width=1690&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=27bbd4a383a1b3d467e93e1edecae3054b03715f\">As you can see, I'm not on the Early Birds version or Stable but for some reason on this PR-28992 version. Is it some kind of early-early beta version or something?</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/mo3ozrktp3zd1.png?width=1696&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3fe1e967892cb1f6b069d04623ef426d2513942f\">This is the odd new icon that shows up by default.</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/e2n9taocq3zd1.png?width=1698&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f990361b8a4580ed99cd282e3e9f2de1bc84c446\">This is the only Arc Max feature that shows up available.</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/mkkhlbzzr3zd1.png?width=3004&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9fffb4fe684dd016ee88f118135539d8c0fa2a47\">I quit the app, and now when I reopened it, it asks me to log in again. It says, for some reason, \\\"Welcome back to Boost.\\\" What is Boost? I'll log in (or try) and see what happens next.</a></p>",
