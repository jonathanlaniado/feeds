Well, after about an hour and a half of using it, and I use \u201cusing\u201d very loosely here, I cannot for the life of me figure out what in the hell this product is meant to do other than overcomplicate and annoy me. Nothing about the UI/UX makes any sense, nor do any of the recommended use cases. They didn\u2019t even port over THE ONE THING THAT MADE ARC AMAZING: SPACES AND SIDEBAR NAVIGATION WITH TABS AND PINS. This is what is known as a \u201cproduct for no one that no one asked for and solves only made up problems that do not exist.\u201d There is absolutely no reason that they could not have built DIA into ARC itself from what I can tell, and they even seemed to be on the path to doing so with some of their actually kinda usable AI features in ARC. Confounding business decision that seems to be based on solely being able to generate new hype for a new product as opposed to making an old and supremely viable product better. Very disappointed to say the least. I don\u2019t want to pile on the people who made the product because I am sure they are working very hard to make it good, but the executive team at TBC needs a good slap upside the head and whichever investors invariably pushed them into this decision should be removed from the cap table.

            "title": "An AI researcher's take on Arc and the Dia pivot",
            "content_html": "<p>I don't usually post on Reddit (mostly a lurker), but the recent discussions around Arc's maintenance mode and Dia have been... intense. Figured I'd share my perspective as someone who actually uses these tools for work.</p>\n<h1>My Arc Journey</h1>\n<p>As an AI researcher, my workflow involves juggling dozens of tabs, dev tools, inspection panels, and resource-heavy websites. Before Arc, I was bouncing between Brave and Firefox like everyone else. Arc's vertical tab management was a revelation \u2013 once my brain recalibrated to it, my productivity genuinely improved.</p>\n<p>Since I don't have a Mac, I've only used Arc on Windows. Here's how much I loved Arc: I'm an Arch Linux user of several years, but I kept a Windows partition <em>specifically</em> for Arc. That's right \u2013 I dual-booted just to use this browser, despite Windows Arc being a second-class citizen with missing features compared to the Mac version. On my main Arch setup, I've been using Zen as the closest Arc alternative, so I had a pretty good sense of where both browsers stood.</p>\n<h1>The Maintenance Mode Reality Check</h1>\n<p>I wasn't following this subreddit closely, but I <em>felt</em> something was off. Arc became a memory hog, increasingly buggy, and frankly annoying to use daily. So I switched to Zen across all my machines before I even knew about the maintenance announcement.</p>\n<p>When I finally stumbled into this subreddit and learned Arc was being sunset, I was baffled. Sure, it's niche \u2013 vertical tabs aren't exactly normie-friendly (trust me, I've tried converting people). But for those of us who \"got it,\" Arc <em>worked</em>. The idea that they expected it to become a mainstream browser seems like a fundamental misunderstanding of their own product.</p>\n<h1>On Dia: Promising but Problematic</h1>\n<p>The Dia concept is interesting from an AI perspective. I've started using Claude and Grok for research instead of traditional search, and there's definitely something there. LLMs can surface information in ways that feel more natural than parsing through search results.</p>\n<p>But here's the problem: you're adding another layer of filtering between users and information. How do you trust a model trained by a company to remain unbiased? It's a valid concern, especially when that model becomes your primary information gateway.</p>\n<p>Realistically, I don't see Dia going mainstream. Big Tech has the resources to offer expensive AI features for free until competitors suffocate. We've seen this playbook before.</p>\n<p>Plus, The Browser Company is setting themselves up for a brutal squeeze from LLM providers. They'll either get crushed by API costs as they scale, or they'll have to invest massive resources into building their own models \u2013 something that requires Google/OpenAI-level capital and talent.</p>\n<h1>The Bigger Picture</h1>\n<p>This feels like classic CEO-user disconnect. Arc had captured a specific market (power users, developers, researchers) with virtually no competition. Instead of doubling down on that strength, they pivoted to chase a broader market that probably never wanted what they were selling anyway.</p>\n<p>Now I'm using Zen, which isn't perfect \u2013 it's buggy, incomplete, very much a work in progress. But with Arc's exit, it's likely to get more contributors and attention.</p>\n<p>Once again, open source outlasts the venture capital darling.</p>\n<h1>Edit: TL;DR for my lazy friends</h1>\n<p>TL;DR: Loved Arc so much I kept Windows just to use it (I'm an Arch user). Switched to Zen when Arc got buggy, then found out about maintenance mode. Dia pivot makes no business sense - they're abandoning a working niche product to chase mainstream users who don't want vertical tabs, while setting themselves up to get crushed by LLM API costs or Big Tech competition. Classic CEO disconnect. Open source (Zen) wins again.</p>",

I remember looking forward to \u201cArc Thursdays\u201d \u2014 new features rolled out every week, thoughtful updates, actual innovation. It was exciting.</p>\n<p>Fast forward to now, and it feels like a completely different story.</p>\n<p>All we get are Chromium security patches. The Windows version? Miles behind macOS \u2014 and honestly, it should never have been released to the public in the state it was. That moment was when I really started feeling like they stopped caring. What once felt like a browser built for people became a ghost of its original vision.</p>\n<p>I recently came across Zen Browser, based on Firefox, and\u2026 it\u2019s basically everything Arc was supposed to be. Smoother performance, better animations, and a design that feels polished and cared for. It captures that initial spark Arc had \u2014 except it\u2019s doing it better.</p>\n<p>Also, let\u2019s talk about how Arc makes it nearly impossible to switch \u2014 no option to export bookmarks? Seriously? That feels like a trap more than a feature. Sure, I love how seamless the sync is between my Windows and iPhone Arc apps \u2014 being able to access open/bookmarked tabs across devices is great \u2014 but it\u2019s just not enough to justify staying anymore.</p>\n<p>Arc had so much hype and potential\u2026 and it\u2019s just disappointing to see how far it\u2019s fallen.</p><div><br></div><img src=\"https://i.redd.it/vj26t6lbub2f1.jpeg\" />",

No idea who your target demographic of a company is for that, but as a security leader, you\u2019re not going to ever get approval from Eng/Legal/Sec on that.

However, Zen lacks key features like DRM support and tab folders, making it not quite ready to replace Arc yet. Excited for Zen\u2019s future!</p>\n<p>I know that when TBC announced their new browser, many people (including myself) jumped ship. In my experience, Arc (on Mac) is an incredibly polished product that really does what it sets out to accomplish, and it does it very well. </p>\n<p>I spent much time with the Zen browser and its new beta, which was officially released today. Zen is amazing. It's Firefox-based, so the AD block works great. Better privacy and more customization. I love the idea of community-driven mods. I love that it's more customizable in the way that you can have everything, including the URL in your sidebar or not whatever you choose. It's open source, unlike Arc, and the devs actually listen very well to feedback and are constable making real changes to better the product. Currently, to my knowledge (I could be wrong), Zen lacks DRM-support for Mac and Windows, which is a deal breaker for me. It also lacks tab folders. Being able to rename your tabs without a 3rd party extension. Closing all your tabs at once is a small feature in Arc that I use all the time. The sidebar font size is small and not easily adjustable (I have bad eyes). Lots of little things that will certainly get worked out. </p>\n<p>I also understand that Zen is a much smaller team, vs Arc which was a larger team backed with more money and dev time i totally understand that and it is not a knock to the Zen time at all. I want Zen to succeed, and I will be on Team Zen! But right now, in a working person's workflow, Arc is just better (for now) I don't have the luxury of working through bugs and reporting them. I know others enjoy that more power to you. </p>\n<p>All that being said, Arc is not perfect, and its future is unknown. But for right now, Arc does what it does better than the rest (for now). I would like to see the day when Zen is going to replacement is just not there yet. I know it will be, and I will be in their corner waiting to switch! </p>\n<p>Let me know what you all think about Zen and your experience.</p>",

Closing them does nothing and I literally have to re-open the entire browser for it to respond again. I have never experienced this on any other browser and these things happen so many times they add up over time and they got me wondering why I'm still using Arc - probably because replacing browsers is a hassle.</p>\n<p>I have a good PC too so it's not anything like that (7800X3D, 4080 Super, 64GB ram). No idea. If anyone has a similar experience on the Windows version and has any tips to share I'd love to hear it and try it out, otherwise if this keeps happening I'm gonna have to switch back to something else... really disappointing performance by this browser.</p>",

The icon changed to a B for some reason (I'll provide screenshots of the odd new looks), and the home menu ui looks completely different. My first thought was it glitched and it updated to an unreleased version of Arc that was being tested; another thought was maybe it gave me a Beta update, but I\u2019m not on beta testing mode, so I shouldn't be getting Beta updates. I'll show you images of the things I've found as of now. Also, the only Arc MAX feature that shows up is \"ChatGPT in the Command Bar,\" and all the rest are gone. I think it might be a glitch, and from my findings and screenshots what seemed to be changed in this 9.9.0 update is a complete home menu UI change, Perplexity-like AI Search engine whenever you search something, an AI chat for in-website questions, horizontal tabs for some reason, new icon, pretty much every Max features removed, new 'Boost' login thing. Oh yea...

Boooy was I in for a treat.</p>\n<p>So what did happen suddenly?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I had my side/tab bar neatly organized, with the url/title in there, the settings and extention icons very conveniently available from the left hand side; under there was a selection of pinned apps and websites+folders;</li>\n<li>The url/title is back in the middle now, turning the full screen experience into a shithole experience; also I have two pairs of chrome extension icons in my tab bar and in my title bar on the right, because I probably need two pairs, just in case I lose one.</li>\n<li>Folders are a thing of the past, website organisation seems to be as well. Good thing I moved my bookmark organisation to <a href=\"http://raindrop.io\">raindrop.io</a> before all of this </li>\n<li>What the heck is this \"Ask a question\" bar that is so ugly blocking the bottom edge of the screen? That is a whole lot of white space it occupies, how the top and bottom margin doesnt align, how you lack the possibility to MAKE IT DISAPPEAR...</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What the hell happened? Did everyone at TBC jump ship? Finished the data mining?</p>\n<p>Honestly, I don't even want Arc back at this point. I did my homework while Arc was showing the first signs of acting up (CPU spikes for no reason, random breaking bugs for vital websites, the telemetry and data privacy affairs..) and decided to have Zen Browser and SigmaOS as alternatives on my MacBook Pro</p>\n<p>I can recommend both, although SigmaOS (despite the shitty name) is running like butter on Mac and has a slight better resemblance of Arc. Zen Browser is a nice project with a lot of nice perks and Firefox as basis but the migration (as of now) is not as smooth.</p>\n<p>Judging from the reactions in this sub and my own emotional outbursts, this is a turning point for Arc. It was good while it lasted. All the best</p>",

And  it's much, much faster than Chrome and Arc, because your browser doesn't need to make 400 API calls to Google servers everytime you launch the <br />\nbrowser.  </p>\n<p>2) Z3n Browser. If you want something similar to Arc, but once again you want something open source and private, with an insanely dedicated developer who listens to user feedback, this is the move. It's running  on the same engine as Firefox.  </p>\n<p>You'll find spaces, the \"peek function\", vertical tabs, etc. And  it's open source so you know for sure your browsing history isn't  getting recorded by Arc without your consent.

Instead, it\u2019s an early research and development project designed to test ideas and get insights to shape the direction of their second product. Think of Number 10 as a temporary, experimental prototype\u2014not a preview of the next official product.</p>\n<p><strong>Why Was Number 10 Created?</strong></p>\n<p>The company used Number 10 to explore different concepts, features, and designs. By letting a small group of people use and test this prototype, they gathered feedback on what might work well and what needs improvement. However, Number 10 is not the final product, nor will it be released as one. It\u2019s part of an experimental phase to see what features might fit in future projects.</p>\n<p><strong>About the Beta Testing Program</strong></p>\n<p>The beta testing phase for Number 10 is now closed, and there will be no new opportunities to join. All current users who participated in the test will eventually transition off this experimental browser as the company wraps up this phase of development.</p>\n<p><strong>What\u2019s Next?</strong></p>\n<p>The team is taking the insights from Number 10 and using them to build a more polished, complete product that will be tailored to a larger audience. While there\u2019s no set launch date for this next product, they\u2019re working to make it something truly innovative based on what they learned from this research.</p>\n<p>To put it simply, Number 10 is not the upcoming product. It was a tool for the company to test new ideas and will not be part of any official launch. Any screenshots, features, or comments about Number 10 reflect the experimental nature of this prototype, not the design of the actual product they are creating.</p>\n<p><strong>Common Questions You Might Have:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cIf Number 10 is just an experiment, why did it seem like it was being marketed?\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To get accurate and honest feedback, the team needed users to feel they were testing a realistic product, not just a \u201csandbox\u201d or trial environment. This way, testers\u2019 reactions, likes, and dislikes were more authentic, helping the team see what might work in an actual product.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cWill any of the things I saw in media posts or screenshots be in the final product?\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It\u2019s possible, but not guaranteed. Features like horizontal tabs or an AI chatbot were part of the experimental design, and their inclusion in the final product will depend on what feedback and results came from the test.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cIs Number 10 the new Arc 2.0? I heard it\u2019s available for download.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>No, Number 10 is not Arc 2.0, and it\u2019s not intended to replace Arc. The beta testing program for Number 10 has closed, and there\u2019s no download available for it anymore. While the company will continue to build on its insights, Number 10 itself won\u2019t become a public product.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cHow do I know that everything I just read isn't a lie and just some slop to make me stop investigating\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You don't, but being who I am within this community, I assume one can believe that I have communicated with the browser company before (<a href=\"https://x.com/JaceThings/status/1796209880782520783\">I've even been to their office</a>) and have semi-quick contact with them, and managing this community has been getting harder based off of not knowing what is and what isn't true, so I reached out for a comment. If you still do not believe me, fair enough, you can wait and see what's going to happen just like the non-members of this community.</p>\n<p>If any of you have any other specific questions, please ask in the comments and I'll try my best to answer them within reason and respect.</p>\n<p>Thanks everyone.</p>",

They are too confused by technology to be able to know to check the LLM's outputs because every single goddamn piece of generative AI technology CAN JUST LIE TO YOU. IT MAKES UP BULLSHIT. And yes, that includes the Whisper model that just does transcription (apparently at medical institutions it is hallucinating racist shit into transcriptions of patient / doctor interactions). If you give something to people that don't understand tech and that talks authoritatively about stuff, it's going to go bad. Really bad. </p>\n<p>Also why would I want an LLM interacting with my websites for me?? In what world would I ever want that? </p>\n<p>Think about it for a second. My browser has direct access to the most private and sensitive information about me. Emails. Messages. Bank account details. All of my social media. In order to automate use of a browser with AI, you're going to have to ship the web page off to a server somewhere because there are currently no local LLM models that can interact with a fucking browser lmao. So what happens if I let this LLM navigate my browser for me, and it accidentally for some reason sends off my bank account number, or my social security number, or my emails, or my texts, anything (just by accident) to one of these services? Those outputs are <em>absolutely</em> going to be used to train the next models (despite what these companies might claim) and they're for sure going to be stored somewhere. That sounds like a security and privacy nightmare. </p>\n<p>Nobody wants this. Nobody is asking for this. The technology to automate a browser is currently and (for the foreseeable future) will not be there because it is not cost effective and the LLMs are EXTREMELY bad at anything that isn't basic summarization. Claude's new computer use model boils an ocean every five seconds because in order to work it has to analyze huge screenshot on your computer and count the # of pixels it needs to click on stuff. That is not cost effective and there is no world in which it magically becomes so. Rabbit tried (and failed) to do it via the accessibility tree for Android and Windows apps. There have been multiple other browser extensions and AI startups who try to automate browser use and absolutely nobody uses them because they all suck, get stuck in a loop, or lie to you. </p>",
