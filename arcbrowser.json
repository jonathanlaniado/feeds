You might remember seeing this ad on YouTube around that time: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roAp7TcOZuA\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roAp7TcOZuA</a></p>\n<p>I remember TBC talked about acquiring a company a while ago, and I believe this company was Cake Browser, as according to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cake_Browser\">Wikipedia</a>, They quietly shut down in 2022 and starting in January of 2023, their website now redirects to Arc's (go to <a href=\"http://www.cakebrowser.com/\">http://www.cakebrowser.com/</a>). In TBC's most recent youtube video talking about their announcement on Jan 30, they preview a demo of fetching the top links from a search engine like google and adding them as new tabs on your sidebar. This is basically Cake's premise, but for desktop. That leads me to the new \"Arc Browser 2.0\" for iOS that TBC is giving out to certain people for testing via TestFlight (perhaps a version of \"Blue\", their mobile demo from a while ago). I'm wondering if this browser will be similar to the Cake Browser, but with more Arc features and TBC polish. Thoughts?</p>",

I love most of its features - love the tiling mechanism, peek on links, Arc Max features, Little Arc, and the newest feature where we can search chatgpt directly from the new tab dialog box.  </p>\n<p>I guess they even added a functionality on my request - separate tab switching carousel for each space, and that just makes this browser even more special for me.  </p>\n<p>But the only thing I do not like is that it is a memory hog. The fact that this is based on chromium is most noticeable because of this behaviour to be honest. I am a CS student, so naturally have a lot of tabs open by default, using multiple web-apps from the sidebar and have vscode permanently open, with other utilities like Terminal/Warp, Obsidian, Preview and Spotify opened 80% of the time. So in most cases the memory consumption reaches 12GBs (very rarely exceeds that). But sometimes when Arc browser has been left opened for a long time (days) it sits on a lot of memory, which leads to bottlenecking and has led to swap usage (once). I tried shifting to Safari, but did not find it as comfortable as it lacked a lot of useful features.  </p>\n<p>The Arc team might be planning to shift from the chromium foundation to webkit (which is known for resource efficiency, eg: Safari, Orion) or an entirely new web engine in the long run (idk, #speculation), but starting with a little attention to the resource efficiency might be a good idea. Edge was also a chromium based browser, but they focussed on its memory aspect and now it is a solid competition to chrome for this. </p>",

We need what comes next\"</strong><br />\nNO, people certainly didn't think that these browsers are good, or good enough. your whole slogan is \"the chrome replacement...\".<br />\nArc should focus on being a \"GOOD WEB BROWSER\" and focus on the core fundamentals of the browser and make them better.<br />\nonce your focus is on adding more and more things other than the core of being good browser, you start becoming bloated and slow. <br />\nBuild a good web browser, fix bugs, make it truly cross platform first and stable (Windows, Linux, Android).<br />\nEvery Arc review I've seen, said pretty much is what attracted them to arc is taking the core fundamental ideas of web browser and change the way we use it. not inventing \"WHAT COMES NEXT\"</li>\n<li><strong>\"The internet is gonna come to you\"</strong><br />\nWhat the video showed here, is the idea of instead of googling something you just type it, and arc automatically opens 5 tabs for you.<br />\nSo... it's just \"I'm feeling lucky\" on Google but more tabs, because I don't feel that lucky!<br />\nand I don't like this because of the same reason me and others don't use I'm feeling lucky. <br />\nit's not that it doesn't work, it works really well actually. but it's that sense of control.<br />\nI don't want my browser to open 5 tabs for me. I want to choose what I open based on the title and the websites that I like.<br />\nAlso, as someone pointed out, sometimes we use google as an address book, like typing a website name to go to, instead of typing the URL because we are lazy. and I want to add to that, google image search, google video search, google news search. you can't replace that with the whole 5 tabs idea.</li>\n<li><strong>\"We wanna build like a new computer\"</strong><br />\nSo... a Chromebook?, the whole idea of the browser being your computer and a platform by itself and relying on like webapps, is the core idea being ChromeOS.<br />\nAnd if that what the company wants to do, forking ChromiumOS and replace chromium with arc browser, thus creating ARCOS, I'm all for it.<br />\nBut again, this has been done before. and I think the focus now should be on making arc better and cross platform, improving the core browser instead of spreading too thin.</li>\n<li><strong>\"Ai software\"</strong><br />\nIt feels from this video, that Arc's focus on ai, is only gonna increase more and more from this point onwards. Which scares me tbh.<br />\nI don't want my browser to be bloated or to be that million ai tools that does things automatically for me.<br />\nThat's why the first thing I do on edge is disabling copilot and all the automation thingys.<br />\nThis point is more personal and that's why I made it the last point, as people might like an AI BROWSER, but I really don't like this approach and I feel like it distracts from the core function of a browser.</li>\n</ol>",

They don't know what they want and what's more useful. I just think that developers' of ArcBrowser are listening too much to the user's feedback.

Head to the Site Settings Button in the URL bar and click the Pin icon on any extension you want easily accessible. Hover over the URL Bar to access any pinned extensions.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Introducing Tab Handoff! Arc keeps your place on each tab regardless of which window you\u2019re using. This is a game-changer, especially for forms, scrolled pages, and videos. This means only one instance of each tab will load, even across multiple windows.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Arc Max\u2019s ChatGPT Command Bar integration is even faster. If you have it enabled, you\u2019ll now see it as a suggestion when typing queries.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Highlighting text on any webpage now exposes a \"Share Quote\" option in the URL bar and right-click menu. Clicking now creates and copies a custom hyperlink to your webpage, with an image that features the quote. Send this via iMessage or Twitter!</p>\n<p>\u2022 Little Arc Windows now auto-archive every 6 hours by default. You can edit this setting in Arc &gt; Settings &gt; General. You can view all archived tabs by hitting CMD T and typing \"View Archive\". Filter for Little Arc.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Right-clicking on the Arc Icon in the Mac Dock provides an option to \"Show/Hide All Little Arc Windows\".</p>\n<p>\u2022 We\u2019ve made fixes to the tab scroll speed and \"overflow indicator\" when navigating to a tab that\u2019s no longer in view in the sidebar.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Easily create a new split by hitting CMD T and typing \"Add Right Split\", \"Add Left Split\", \"Add Top Split\", or \"Add Bottom Split\".</p>\n<p>\u2022 The Library will now automatically open to the last-used section. For example, after downloading, the Downloads section will be selected first upon opening the Library.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Restoring tabs from the Archive now automatically routes back to the Space they came from.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Text fields in Easels now have spell check enabled by default.</p>\n<p>\u2022 The Space Viewer in the Library now allows dragging/dropping tabs into empty Spaces.</p>\n<p>\u2022 It\u2019s now possible to mute a tab in Split View by right-clicking on the split and selecting \"Mute\" under the tab\u2019s name. It\u2019s also now possible to duplicate a split in the tab\u2019s right-click menu.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Adding Shared Folders to your sidebar will now always insert at the bottom of your Pinned Tabs section.</p>\n<p>\u2022 We\u2019ve fixed the formatting of text on Easel link cards.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Site Search on X (formerly Twitter) now uses the new X branding and name.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Right-click on a shortcut in Arc &gt; Settings to more easily \"Reset Shortcut to Default\".</p>\n<p>\u2022 Enabling and Disabling Previews can now be done in the Site Settings button in the URL Bar.</p>\n<p>\u2022 The \"Back to PiP\" button from the Mini Audio Player now animates while heading to the proper location.</p>\n<p>\u2022 We\u2019ve fixed a long-standing bug where hitting the Share button on an Easel in Peek didn\u2019t work.</p>\n<p>\u2022 We fixed the issue causing custom space-switching shortcuts to be reset on restart of Arc.</p>\n<p>\u2022 We\u2019ve fixed a bug where downloads were defaulting to the \"last saved location\" as the destination, despite selecting a specific folder in preferences.</p>\n<p>\u2022 We\u2019ve fixed a bug where Arc Max Tidy Downloads were incorrectly renaming files.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Performance improvement: We\u2019ve fixed a potential performance issue that could arise from leaving the Preferences window open in the background.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Performance improvement: each Little Arc window will perform fewer per-profile actions when first opening.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Arc v1.19.1 contains an important security fix for a Chromium vulnerability. We strongly recommend updating to Arc v1.19.1 as soon as you can, as it is based on Chromium 119.0.6045.199, which contains this fix. Update and stay safe out there!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Manual Download Link:</strong>\nhttps://releases.arc.net/release/Arc-1.19.1-43687.zip</p>\n<p><strong>Release Notes:</strong>\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh7AHK7zD50</p>",

But corporate incentives hold back our internet more than we know.  If you\u2019re a reporter, go ask Google directly: \u201cDo you ship new features to Chrome if people LOVE them but they hurt search query volume in testing?\u201d  The answer is NO!</p>\n<p>The point is not that making money is bad. It\u2019s that if we  can break free from Google's grip on the Web, a more wondrous, creative internet life is waiting for us.  It\u2019s time to shake things up. It\u2019s time to move beyond Google.

It is \u26a1\ufe0f2x faster to use ChatGPT in Arc than in other browsers \u26a1\ufe0f (we counted the clicks).</p>\n<p>One final point: the fastest, easiest way to use ChatGPT on your computer didn\u2019t even take AI (or anything fancy) to pull off\u2026  </p>\n<p>Just a human-centric approach to having YOUR back on the Internet, instead of optimizing for Search Ads.

That is a super simplistic way of determining whether or not Arc is good at memory management.  For example, just go and use Safari and you'll notice that it uses a lot of memory, but what you will also notice is that your memory pressure on the machine is much lower than it is with Arc or some other browser. Not even Edge can touch it.  </p>\n<p>But there are times when people will post that Arc sucks with memory use but when I look at the screen shot of their activity monitor I see that it's actually not doing a bad job.  Anyways, just wanted to throw that out there and let me know from real CS folk if I'm saying something stupid.</p>",

This is freaking huge for me.<br />\n- Split-screen mode is SO MUCH BETTER than multiple tabs<br />\n- The keyboard shortcuts are so useful. If you learn a few of them you'll be superpowered. Especially shift-cmd-W!<br />\n- Promoting links from Current to Pinned is effortless and amazing<br />\n- Clearing history after 12 hours is delicious<br />\n- Mini-arc makes browsing most sites like reddit where you need to read an inner document so good.  </p>\n<p>There's probably a 1000 more things I can think of after I hit Save here.
