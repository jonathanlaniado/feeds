Thank you</p>\n<p>AI in browser is something I wanted for a long time and never knew why wouldn't browsers implement it because it has so much potential.</p>\n<p>As a web developer my time and focus are really of the essence. I've been using browser extension that summaries page, and it's been game changing for me. Seeing it in the browser really makes me happy.</p>\n<p>Enhancing Find (command + f) is a really really smart idea. Let's just enhance existing feature without altering it's default behaviour, and not bring in new one with new shortcut. I love it.</p>\n<p>Link previews are nice for specific use case. I personally don't find it useful, but I can see how good can it be for some people.</p>\n<p>Tidy tab titles are great but I'd personally would like to rename tab by pressing right click on it and then rename it with AI, since it would be more useful, because I don't want my pinned to have 15 pinned tabs. Actually I don't use pinned tabs at all :)</p>\n<p>GPT in command bar is not as useful as I want it to be, since tab with GPT is in my favourites, and is accessible with one click, instead of doing 3 keys combo.</p>\n<p>MAX has been getting some backlashes, and that is understandable. Every new product, idea or feature will get bad critics. It is also understandable that they hit limit on Open AI, hell, even Open AI hit limits with Open AI when ChatGPT first came out. I don't think hitting limit is a bad programming or bad QA. With that logic ChatGPT is bad programming and QA, which we can definitely say IT IS NOT.</p>\n<p>I also think that guys from Browser Company are great. They've been so open about their work, funding, future, past, everything they've been doing, and that really makes me feel like part of their team. I've been using Arc as my main browser since beta, and couldn't change it under no circumstances.</p>\n<p>Anyway, this was just my take on features and stuff that have been happening lately. I know how reddit can be harsh and toxic, and if you don't like something there is toggle to turn it off, and it will be like it never existed.</p>\n<p>Happy Wednesday everyone</p>",

I saw a post earlier that suggested Arc\u2019s going paid. I haven\u2019t seen any copy that suggests a paid bundle, and Josh/TBC's <a href=\"https://x.com/joshm/status/1707508665643565172?s=46&amp;t=kA-7VIXPVHFu8R42AtK4Vw\">comments</a> make this unlikely.</p>\n<p>However, models like GPT-4 are costly, so I imagine to stay free Max will have to continue on much worse models like Anthropic. Personally I reckon it\u2019d be better to pay to get actually decent results.</p>\n<p>I was excited to see where AI could go in the browser. Waiting 6 months to only get here feels very disappointing, especially when they made a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/joshm/status/1666821015585058822?s=46&amp;t=kA-7VIXPVHFu8R42AtK4Vw\">big deal</a> about spending the time to make it proper, and still ended up with a worse version of SigmaOS\u2019s.</p></div>",

I create some spaces like general/focus/chill, but it turns out that whenever i open arc, the first thing i do is not to think about which space should the tab that i want to open goes to; instead, i just put it wherever i am. And also, when im already in \u201cfocus\u201d space for a long time for example, and suddenly i have this very cool \u201cchilling\u201d idea, the first thing i would do is not to switch to \u201cchill\u201d space; instead the first reaction is always to open a new tab using my very handy shortcut whichever space im in. So in the end, the thing is always that one space gets especially crowded but the others are mostly empty because im too lazy to switch spaces or maybe this design is just anti-human. I dont know if anyone has similar experiences with me. But i still love the idea of grouping different tabs into separate spaces.</p></div>",

This way, we could disable or enable certain profiles (or spaces), depending on the Focus mode we are in. I would love to disable my casual space when I am at work, so that I get less distracted.</p></div>",
