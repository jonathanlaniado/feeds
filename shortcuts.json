Every now and then I will accidentally turn my alarm off instead of hitting snooze and this has helped. \nI have a daily weekday alarm labeled work that goes off at 6am and a second alarm not on a schedule to go off at 6:20. This shortcut runs every weekday one minute before my 6am alarm and checks to see if that alarm is on or off (holidays or scheduled days off I manually turn off the 6am alarm). If the 6am alarm is on, it turns on my 6:20 alarm. If my phone is still plugged in at 6:20, that second alarm will also sound. If I unplug my phone before 6:20, the second alarm turns off. </p>\n<p>Just sharing as this has helped me</p>",

Yes you read that right.And once it verifies that all the screenshots have been converted then the shortcut will delete the original screenshot for you (although you can find the deleted screenshots in the \u201crecently deleted\u201d in photos app, if for any reason you want to recover the original screenshots)And after that's done it also shows a notification with how much space the original screenshot took and how much space the new converted screenshots take.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><strong><em>Prerequisite:</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT</strong>.

(Recommended)<strong>OR</strong></li>\n<li>Just use it manually whenever you want to compress the screenshots.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>PS - If you have a large number of Screenshots, it will take a significant of time for them to be converted and saved so be patient during your first time using this and if possible just clear out and close all other apps and maybe restart your phone before starting the process (only for the first time and only if you have hundreds or thousands of screenshots)</p>\n<p><strong><em>Also you would need to allow the shortcut to access/save a multiple images.</em></strong></p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/4n07zi56wfsb1.png?width=1170&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff794a70f411ef507f4be2b26869a0db5d17abd8</p>",

You can do this when your PC is completely off! Note- this guide is only for LOCAL remote starts. It's possible to do it remotely, but I won't be going over that in this post- it just takes some extra elbow grease!</p>\n<p>Things you'll need-</p>\n<p>-An apple device that can run shortcuts<br />\n-Ethernet connection from router to PC<br />\n-Wolow App  (I use the paid version, not sure if the free one let's you do the same thing)<br />\n-Wolow Companion App for PC (Not required, but nice if you want to remote shut-down/restart your PC as well)<br />\n<a href=\"https://wolow.site/\">Wolow - Wake on LAN</a> (They have their own guide as well!)  </p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Make sure WOL is enabled for your PC (I had to go into bios and enable \" Power On By PCI-E\"). You may have to open your ethernet adapter properties-&gt;networking-&gt;configure-&gt;advanced-&gt;Enable Wake on Magic Packet  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>BE SURE YOUR PC HAS A STATIC IP ADDRESS, OTHERWISE YOU'LL HAVE TO CONSTANTLY UPDATE IT MANUALLY. I bumped into issues when I assigned it in my network settings <strong>on my PC</strong>, so instead I opened my <strong>router settings</strong> and reserved the IP under the \"devices\" section for my PC.(This will vary from one router to another, you'll just have to google how to do this for your own)<br />\n<strong>Note:</strong> I'm not sure if WOLOW companion automatically updates the IP address of your device. If it does, then I guess you can just skip step 2, unless you want to setup a remote start outside of your local network.  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If I remember correctly, if you use the paid version with Wolow Companion, you can just press \"Scan Network\" in the Wolow App, and it should automatically fill in the information for whichever PC it finds on your network. If this is the case for you, then skip to step 6- If not, go to step 4!  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Note the following information (Can be found by doing \"ipconfig /all\" in the command prompt )--MAC &amp; IP Address of the computer you want to remote start-Ping Address (IPv4 address)-Wake on LAN (WoL) port, which is usually 9,7, or 0 (9 is most common)  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Open up the Wolow app, add new device, type in the information from step 3 (You can name it whatever you want)  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you did everything correctly, once you have your device selected, it should show the awake status as \"Awake\" and give you a response time on the right. It will now start when you press the power button in the middle!  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Go into your shortcuts app, create a new shortcut, select \"Wake up device\", choose your PC on the selection screen, rename the shortcut to whatever you want!(You don't HAVE to rename the shortcut- I only did so I can just say \"Siri, <strong>Start my PC</strong>\"- do whatever you want though!)<br />\n<strong>Note:</strong> You can also create a shutdown shortcut, though you need the Wolow Companion app in order for it to work.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Hopefully this guide helps some of you! If you guys have any questions just let me know, I'll try my best to answer them!</p>\n<p>Edit: Formatting</p>",

My Apple Pay transactions all happen in Chilean Pesos, which tend to fluctuate quite a bit compared to the US Dollar. I set up a personal automation that automatically converts my Apple Pay transactions into my preferred currency using the new Transaction Automation in Shortcuts. Thought it would be useful to share for those who live in another country or just want to set this up before an international trip.</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/6ix7ewta37rb1.jpg?width=1125&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e5c2f56c93e8e1c164595029761219c259a83006</p>\n<p>Getting this configured takes a few steps, but isn\u2019t too hard. I'm sharing the base shortcut here, which makes it easier to get started.</p>\n<p>First install <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/id1494942612\">Morpho Converter</a> to do the currency conversion (full disclosure: I am a developer on this app). Run the app once to make sure its currencies are populated. Then install the <a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/56c18846112f4c279a1462e3e821e973\">Apple Pay Conversion shortcut</a>. During setup you will be asked to configure the currency payments are made in and the currency you would like to convert to.</p>\n<p>Then you have to configure your personal automation. Open the <strong>Shortcuts</strong> app and navigate to the <strong>Automations</strong> tab. Tap the <strong>+</strong> button to add a new automation. Scroll down to and select <strong>Transaction</strong>.</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/5567cu4d37rb1.jpg?width=1125&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99d31dbe700bfd424d1a00fc5b95d33521a72560</p>\n<p>The next screen allows you to select which cards and categories you want this automation to apply to. I keep all selected. But at the bottom of the screen choose <strong>Run Immediately</strong> to avoid having to manually confirm that you want the conversion to run. You can keep <strong>Notify When Run</strong> turned off, as the shortcut itself will end up sending you a notification. Tap <strong>Next</strong> to continue.</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/slrw6efg37rb1.jpg?width=1125&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77ff7e25a8e66a3934cbf2bb0ea185be19c1ede5</p>\n<p>Transaction automations have a unique shortcut input that we\u2019ll need to configure, so rather than choosing your shortcut directly, choose <strong>New Blank Automation</strong>. Inside your new automation, tap <strong>Add Action</strong> and add a <strong>Run Shortcut</strong> action.</p>\n<p>Tap <strong>Shortcut</strong> and choose the newly installed <strong>Apple Pay Conversion</strong> shortcut. To ensure it receives the correct input, tap the button to expand the shortcut. Tap <strong>Choose Variable</strong> and choose <strong>Shortcut Input</strong>. Here\u2019s the non-obvious part: tap again where it now says <strong>Shortcut Input</strong> to configure which part of the transaction gets passed in for conversion. You\u2019ll want to select <strong>Amount</strong>.</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/h8nyoq7i37rb1.jpg?width=1125&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52ad32992d7816075b4f981367708c79d1ca1f24</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Your automation is now configured. Just tap <strong>Done</strong> and you\u2019re good to go. Would love to hear if anyone has ideas to improve the shortcut or automation. Hope you find it helpful.</p></div>",

If you\u2019re connected to WiFi, and you run this shortcut, cellular data will be turned off to preserve battery and WiFi will be left on. Same applies to vice versa.</p>\n<p>Comments detailing each section of the shortcut so that you can (somewhat) tinker with the shortcut and suit it to your needs, if need be.</p>\n<p>Slow execution time, I don\u2019t know how to speed it up, since it goes through so many checks, but it\u2019s not too slow and it works.</p>\n<p>Initial setup menu, allowing you to toggle individually what you want to be toggled when running the shortcut, such as Bluetooth, airplane mode, and various other features that this shortcut has.</p>\n<p>Config reset protocol. Previously, you had to manually look up the config folder in files and then manually delete it, but now all you have to do is set both your volume and brightness to maximum and your focus to Driving, and run the shortcut. After that, a prompt will appear to delete the config folder. This will help you decide which setup option is best for you in an easy way.</p>\n<p>Advanced charging, where you can choose to fully power up your phone when charging, display a notification when your battery reaches 80%, so that you can preserve your battery health, and show a rough estimate of when your battery is gonna be fully charged.</p>\n<p>This shortcut does not require you to install any third party app, and was made to work on any iPhone model having iOS 16+. I\u2019ve been using this shortcut on my 14 for a year now, and I\u2019ve been very satisfied with it since it works without issues, which is also why I believe this will be the last update for it.</p>\n<p>Install: https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/4239cb6be5e246f1acd02a7e84988cd7</p>\n<p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS</strong></p>\n<p>Run the shortcut, go through the setup process, then go to automations and create 3 automations. One for when low power mode is turned on or off, one when the battery level is at 80% (not less and not more, just when it\u2019s specifically 80%) and one where your phone is connected / disconnected from power. Insert a \u201cRun shortcut\u201d action into each of them, and select the advanced low power mode shortcut. That\u2019s it!</p>\n<p>Edit:</p>\n<p>If you do use this shortcut, please take some time and leave a comment. It would make my day seeing that the shortcut I\u2019ve put months of work into is getting some recognition (previously it hasn\u2019t done very well) and do tell what you would like to see improved in the shortcut.</p></div>",

For users without an iPhone 15 Pro (Max), there is an alternative by placing a shortcut on your home screen. The explanation of how to install this is described in this article (perfectly translatable via your browser).</p>\n<p>Setting up Shortcuts requires several steps, sorry for that. It is a very comprehensive shortcut that works with Focus mode and the Files app to temporarily save data.</p>\n<p>You can find the explanation how to install the shortcuts here: <a href=\"https://www.appletips.nl/actieknop-iphone-uitbreiden/\">https://www.appletips.nl/actieknop-iphone-uitbreiden/</a> (article is in Dutch, but you can translate it via your browser)</p>\n<p>I am curious to hear what you guys think of my Shortcut.</p></div>",

Turning mute on provides double tap haptic feedback, turning mute off provide single tap haptic feedback. </p>\n<p>-If the iPhone is in landscape left orientation (dynamic island on the left), it will immediately launch the camera app in photo mode when pressing the action button. </p>\n<p>-I have two duplicate menus setup (screenshot above), one menu is shown when NO focus mode is enabled, and another menu when ANY focus mode is enabled. This could easily be modified as needed for specific focus mode names. I just duplicated all the menu items as a demo. The menu is only shown if the device is NOT in either of the orientations above that directly launch mute/camera. </p>\n<p>- \"Climate On\" is for Tesla cars, and will automatically turn on climate control to the existing setting. </p>\n<p>-The main action button shortcut relies on the \"Super mute\" shortcut.</p>\n<p>-The shortcut also relies on the free \"Actions\" iPhone app for additional shortcut actions.</p>\n<p>Main shortcut: <a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/cdee391a4bc94aeb8fd0c863b0dd20b0\">https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/cdee391a4bc94aeb8fd0c863b0dd20b0</a></p>\n<p>Super Mute shortcut: <a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/e19a628546b94634a7450c450a52b577\">https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/e19a628546b94634a7450c450a52b577</a></p>\n<p>iOS Actions App (free): <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/actions/id1586435171\">https://apps.apple.com/us/app/actions/id1586435171</a></p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p></div>",
