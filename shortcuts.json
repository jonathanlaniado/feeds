It lets you use a variety of themes and icons, and you can apply them with shortcuts to be used with any app. The app is called <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/iconic-app-icon-themer/id6454675338\">Iconic - App Icon Themer</a>, and although it includes a few themes for free, I'm going to be giving away a lifetime key to unlock all themes and future content!

I put the link here:</p>\n<p>https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/25b4f0ba1e124ca2af78c81609a54f27</p>\n<p>\ud83d\udd39Why the shortcut:\nThe main frustration I had so far with the current calendar app is that whenever I wasn\u2019t sure where I was going / supposed to go for my event, I had to open up maps on the side, look up the address, verify it\u2019s the right place in the right city, copy the addy and come back on the calendar app to paste it. I also feel setting up events via the menu feature of shortcuts is more user friendly, feels more smooth to set up an event.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve built this up so I can benefit from the Apple Maps feature with the Calendar app. I think that would be great something similar gets integrated into the Calendar app by Apple itself at some point, there\u2019s def some UX improvements they can do on that</p>\n<p>\ud83d\udd39How it works \nHere\u2019s how the shortcut works: \n1 - Event title\n2 - Set start and end event \n3 - Look up the address for your event (just directly click Ok if no address) \n3.1 - Once you have your location, click share then copy to copy the address, click Ok to confirm &amp; add the location for the event \n4 - Set yourself an alert, you have the none option (A second alert at time to leave is set by default as well to get to your location in time)\n5 - Add yourself a note if necessary (just click Ok if none)</p>\n<p>\ud83d\udd39Conclusion\nThat\u2019s it, your event is set up, with location, alerts and notes done so you stay organized and prepared</p>\n<p>\ud83d\udd39Feedback\nAnyway, have a look yourself and let me know what you think! I\u2019d love to get your feedback and if you think of additional features that should/could be added to it, please share with us your improvements</p>\n<p>Thank you!!</p>",

So i created an automation to log texts as they came in and before they get deleted, especially helpful when I'm not near my devices to try and see the text before it's deleted. </p>\n<p>Step 1. Create a note to act as your log and save it in whatever folder you want. If you rename it or move it later, you'll have to fit the automation to look for the new note/location. I called it Test Message Log for the image above. </p>\n<p>Step 2. Create an automation based on receiving a text from someone. Select the person (i used 'Test' in the image above) and any keywords you may want to use as filters. I left it blank so any message from them will be captured. Select 'Run immediately'. Hit next. </p>\n<p>Step 3. Select 'New blank automation'.</p>\n<p>Step 4. Search for and add the  'Get text from input' action. Select shortcut input as the variable. </p>\n<p>Step 5. Search for and add the 'Text' action.  Format the text as you would like it to appear in the note. Select the 'current date' variable and format it how you wish. Select the 'text' variable to get the text from Step 4 above.\n(I put in some dashes as a separator for the messages, a couple of stars around the date to make it stand out a bit). </p>\n<p>Step 6. Search for and add the 'Append to note' action. Set the variable to the text created in Step 5. Select the note you created in Step 1.  </p>\n<p>[I probably don't need the first 'get text from input' action and could just pass that text from the message right into the 'text' action. ]</p><div><br></div><img src=\"https://i.redd.it/bwiu1uueex6c1.jpeg\" />",

This shortcut runs every weekday one minute before my 6am alarm and checks to see if that alarm is on or off (holidays or scheduled days off I manually turn off the 6am alarm). If the 6am alarm is on, it turns on my 6:20 alarm. If my phone is still plugged in at 6:20, that second alarm will also sound.

You can do this when your PC is completely off! Note- this guide is only for LOCAL remote starts. It's possible to do it remotely, but I won't be going over that in this post- it just takes some extra elbow grease!</p>\n<p>Things you'll need-</p>\n<p>-An apple device that can run shortcuts<br />\n-Ethernet connection from router to PC<br />\n-Wolow App  (I use the paid version, not sure if the free one let's you do the same thing)<br />\n-Wolow Companion App for PC (Not required, but nice if you want to remote shut-down/restart your PC as well)<br />\n<a href=\"https://wolow.site/\">Wolow - Wake on LAN</a> (They have their own guide as well!)  </p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Make sure WOL is enabled for your PC (I had to go into bios and enable \" Power On By PCI-E\"). You may have to open your ethernet adapter properties-&gt;networking-&gt;configure-&gt;advanced-&gt;Enable Wake on Magic Packet  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>BE SURE YOUR PC HAS A STATIC IP ADDRESS, OTHERWISE YOU'LL HAVE TO CONSTANTLY UPDATE IT MANUALLY. I bumped into issues when I assigned it in my network settings <strong>on my PC</strong>, so instead I opened my <strong>router settings</strong> and reserved the IP under the \"devices\" section for my PC.(This will vary from one router to another, you'll just have to google how to do this for your own)<br />\n<strong>Note:</strong> I'm not sure if WOLOW companion automatically updates the IP address of your device. If it does, then I guess you can just skip step 2, unless you want to setup a remote start outside of your local network.  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If I remember correctly, if you use the paid version with Wolow Companion, you can just press \"Scan Network\" in the Wolow App, and it should automatically fill in the information for whichever PC it finds on your network. If this is the case for you, then skip to step 6- If not, go to step 4!  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Note the following information (Can be found by doing \"ipconfig /all\" in the command prompt )--MAC &amp; IP Address of the computer you want to remote start-Ping Address (IPv4 address)-Wake on LAN (WoL) port, which is usually 9,7, or 0 (9 is most common)  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Open up the Wolow app, add new device, type in the information from step 3 (You can name it whatever you want)  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you did everything correctly, once you have your device selected, it should show the awake status as \"Awake\" and give you a response time on the right. It will now start when you press the power button in the middle!  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Go into your shortcuts app, create a new shortcut, select \"Wake up device\", choose your PC on the selection screen, rename the shortcut to whatever you want!(You don't HAVE to rename the shortcut- I only did so I can just say \"Siri, <strong>Start my PC</strong>\"- do whatever you want though!)<br />\n<strong>Note:</strong> You can also create a shutdown shortcut, though you need the Wolow Companion app in order for it to work.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Hopefully this guide helps some of you! If you guys have any questions just let me know, I'll try my best to answer them!</p>\n<p>Edit: Formatting</p>",

My Apple Pay transactions all happen in Chilean Pesos, which tend to fluctuate quite a bit compared to the US Dollar. I set up a personal automation that automatically converts my Apple Pay transactions into my preferred currency using the new Transaction Automation in Shortcuts. Thought it would be useful to share for those who live in another country or just want to set this up before an international trip.</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/6ix7ewta37rb1.jpg?width=1125&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e5c2f56c93e8e1c164595029761219c259a83006</p>\n<p>Getting this configured takes a few steps, but isn\u2019t too hard. I'm sharing the base shortcut here, which makes it easier to get started.</p>\n<p>First install <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/id1494942612\">Morpho Converter</a> to do the currency conversion (full disclosure: I am a developer on this app). Run the app once to make sure its currencies are populated. Then install the <a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/56c18846112f4c279a1462e3e821e973\">Apple Pay Conversion shortcut</a>. During setup you will be asked to configure the currency payments are made in and the currency you would like to convert to.</p>\n<p>Then you have to configure your personal automation. Open the <strong>Shortcuts</strong> app and navigate to the <strong>Automations</strong> tab. Tap the <strong>+</strong> button to add a new automation. Scroll down to and select <strong>Transaction</strong>.</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/5567cu4d37rb1.jpg?width=1125&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99d31dbe700bfd424d1a00fc5b95d33521a72560</p>\n<p>The next screen allows you to select which cards and categories you want this automation to apply to. I keep all selected. But at the bottom of the screen choose <strong>Run Immediately</strong> to avoid having to manually confirm that you want the conversion to run. You can keep <strong>Notify When Run</strong> turned off, as the shortcut itself will end up sending you a notification. Tap <strong>Next</strong> to continue.</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/slrw6efg37rb1.jpg?width=1125&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77ff7e25a8e66a3934cbf2bb0ea185be19c1ede5</p>\n<p>Transaction automations have a unique shortcut input that we\u2019ll need to configure, so rather than choosing your shortcut directly, choose <strong>New Blank Automation</strong>. Inside your new automation, tap <strong>Add Action</strong> and add a <strong>Run Shortcut</strong> action.</p>\n<p>Tap <strong>Shortcut</strong> and choose the newly installed <strong>Apple Pay Conversion</strong> shortcut. To ensure it receives the correct input, tap the button to expand the shortcut. Tap <strong>Choose Variable</strong> and choose <strong>Shortcut Input</strong>. Here\u2019s the non-obvious part: tap again where it now says <strong>Shortcut Input</strong> to configure which part of the transaction gets passed in for conversion. You\u2019ll want to select <strong>Amount</strong>.</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/h8nyoq7i37rb1.jpg?width=1125&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52ad32992d7816075b4f981367708c79d1ca1f24</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Your automation is now configured. Just tap <strong>Done</strong> and you\u2019re good to go. Would love to hear if anyone has ideas to improve the shortcut or automation. Hope you find it helpful.</p></div>",

One for when low power mode is turned on or off, one when the battery level is at 80% (not less and not more, just when it\u2019s specifically 80%) and one where your phone is connected / disconnected from power. Insert a \u201cRun shortcut\u201d action into each of them, and select the advanced low power mode shortcut. That\u2019s it!</p>\n<p>Edit:</p>\n<p>If you do use this shortcut, please take some time and leave a comment. It would make my day seeing that the shortcut I\u2019ve put months of work into is getting some recognition (previously it hasn\u2019t done very well) and do tell what you would like to see improved in the shortcut.</p></div>",

This allows the Action Button to have multiple Shortcuts associated with it, and have a shortcut executed by pressing 1x, 2x or 3x on the Action Button. For users without an iPhone 15 Pro (Max), there is an alternative by placing a shortcut on your home screen.

Turning mute on provides double tap haptic feedback, turning mute off provide single tap haptic feedback. </p>\n<p>-If the iPhone is in landscape left orientation (dynamic island on the left), it will immediately launch the camera app in photo mode when pressing the action button. </p>\n<p>-I have two duplicate menus setup (screenshot above), one menu is shown when NO focus mode is enabled, and another menu when ANY focus mode is enabled. This could easily be modified as needed for specific focus mode names. I just duplicated all the menu items as a demo. The menu is only shown if the device is NOT in either of the orientations above that directly launch mute/camera. </p>\n<p>- \"Climate On\" is for Tesla cars, and will automatically turn on climate control to the existing setting. </p>\n<p>-The main action button shortcut relies on the \"Super mute\" shortcut.</p>\n<p>-The shortcut also relies on the free \"Actions\" iPhone app for additional shortcut actions.</p>\n<p>Main shortcut: <a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/cdee391a4bc94aeb8fd0c863b0dd20b0\">https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/cdee391a4bc94aeb8fd0c863b0dd20b0</a></p>\n<p>Super Mute shortcut: <a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/e19a628546b94634a7450c450a52b577\">https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/e19a628546b94634a7450c450a52b577</a></p>\n<p>iOS Actions App (free): <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/actions/id1586435171\">https://apps.apple.com/us/app/actions/id1586435171</a></p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p></div>",
