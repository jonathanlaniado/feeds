Most are very simple actions. They range from talking to AI, to rolling D&amp;D dice, to background noises, to finding a lost phone. I did not author all of these, only some, and some were borrowed and then altered. </p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br />\n\u2022 <strong>Backup Shortcuts.</strong> Takes all your Shortcuts and puts them in a .zip file in your iCloud Drive. You can then unzip and recover Shortcuts individually if anything has gone wrong with any or all of them (like when I edit one and accidentally delete half of it). https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/1da201ddc03146ecaaffa1d820a0c3fb</p>\n<p>\u2022 <strong>ChatGPT Voice Chat.</strong> This quickly opens the ChatGPT app to the voice chat page. It\u2019s literally one step, but I find it most useful added as a \u201cback tap\u201d action, so that tapping the phone talks to ChatGPT. Sharing for that reason. https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/01c08a4b200444ef974234344ab690ad</p>\n<p>\u2022 <strong>Pro AI.</strong> Someone\u2019s ChatGPT voice bot without the app. https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/cbe8040cc8824975a69d53699255191a</p>\n<p>\u2022 <strong>Gemini.</strong> AI powered by Google\u2019s Gemini. Can accept text, voice, images, and files. https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/4ee97df41eef4782a14d89c35b39f98c</p>\n<p>\u2022 <strong>Google Lens.</strong> Get Google Lens on your iPhone. Search for whatever is on your screen. Requires Google app. https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/98763a5ae2a440ef98f9d8eba95f3338</p>\n<p>\u2022 <strong>Find Nearest Hospital.</strong> Gets your location and quickly outputs the nearest hospitals. Gives various options to get there: walking, driving, transit, various ride share apps. For ride share, it then adds the address to the clipboard and opens that app. Author\u2019s name is in the notes. One of the actions says it won\u2019t be supported in future versions. If anyone knows how to fix it that\u2019d be great. It works for now. https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/6cb4117f9ac64812ba40d09e0409b0ac</p>\n<p>\u2022 <strong>Randomizer.</strong> Generates random numbers from atmospheric noise. Generates coin flips, dice rolls, playing card hands, first and last names, hex colors, or random items from a list you enter. Requires the other Shortcut \u201cMulti-Dice\u201d to do dice rolls. I\u2019ll fix that some day. https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/dbb7a566a151458ea873f7ce68c9c092</p>\n<p>\u2022 <strong>Multi-Dice Roll.</strong> Simulates rolling multiple dice with any number of sides. https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/a4a9bc9135254edcaa8d9cf5e71b8e70</p>\n<p>\u2022 <strong>D&amp;D Dice.</strong> Same as Multi-Dice Roll, but with added Advantage and Disadvantage (rolling twice and taking the higher or lower number) for Dungeons and Dragons. https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/aed105c0dfe145d6b593333923c354bd</p>\n<p>\u2022 <strong>Background Sounds On/Off.</strong> Lets you choose a background sound (rain, stream, various white noises) to turn on, or turn off the sound. This is usually buried in Accessibility settings. https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/a0676ddf48b94d4cbd8b6dba34bcd24a</p>\n<p>\u2022 <strong>4 Hour Background Noise.</strong> Turns on background noise for 4 hours and then stops. https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/2674bffe233b4b41ac9a5c10f8016b10. For now it depends on this other Shortcut for the waiting time: https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/06993ff0bfd945029c2bc24791a757da. They shouldn\u2019t be too hard to combine; I just haven\u2019t.</p>\n<p>\u2022 <strong>Toggle VPN.</strong> Toggles VPN, then repeatedly checks until it has finished connecting and then displays \u201cConnected,\u201d or in the other case \u201cDisconnected.\u201d You\u2019ll have to replace the Connect and Disconnect actions (there\u2019s only 1 of each) with those for your particular VPN. If there\u2019s a better way to check when it connects besides excessive waiting and checking, please share! https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/db5956f536a0488cae3e302b1b0337d8</p>\n<p>\u2022 <strong>Where Are You?.</strong> If you can\u2019t find your phone, but it might be nearby, this will make it speak and play a loud alarm. Use with \u201cHey Siri\u201d voice activation (\u201cHey Siri, where are you?\u201d) https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/bbd654e76cd94d5e87c460818801d955</p>\n<p>\u2022 <strong>I Found You.</strong> Use after finding the phone after using \u201cWhere are you?\u201d Returns volume to normal and ends alarm. Change volume number as you please. https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/2bbff787e691454a91fee0224c413e63</p>\n<p>\u2022 <strong>I\u2019m Getting Pulled Over.</strong> For police interactions and more. Dims the screen and begins recording from the front camera. When you end recording (manually), it texts the video to who you choose when you first set it up and uploads it to iCloud or wherever you choose. You\u2019ll have to fill in the contact and save location before using. https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/109c41acb51e40b8803642ad8d34bf9f</p>\n<p>\u2022 <strong>What\u2019s the Speed Limit?</strong> Gets the speed limit for the road you\u2019re on. https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/af01647a5bf148d5aab6b65fbf9c77e9</p>\n<p>\u2022  <strong>Text Above Picture.</strong> Adds text above a chosen image. https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/5768d012cb2746c985774152c655642d</p>\n<p>\u2022 <strong>Live Photo to GIF.</strong> Turns selected Live Photo to a GIF. https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/d64947db613349cbaeb8570081589a39</p>\n<p>\u2022 <strong>Save File As.</strong> Choose what to save a file as. https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/3c990a57edf9466b9131996067daecb5</p>\n<p>\u2022 <strong>All Media Downloader.</strong> Downloads media from various sites, including Reddit, via the Share Sheet. https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/d1d14ea3cb264f3d9f52a6b4ccd5165b</p>\n<p><strong>Apple News to Safari.</strong> Opens Apple News pages in Safari. https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/5ddddee2ead94fedb6b6f650ef7ce3f8</p>\n<p>\u2022 <strong>Face ID App Locker.</strong> Set as automation when opening a particular app. Brings up the Lock Screen when opening that app, preventing someone without the Face ID or password from seeing its contents (may be visible for a second or two). Set the re-lock interval to the number of minutes you want it to wait before locking again. Sometimes this interval doesn\u2019t work, and it locks every time. If anyone knows a fix, please share! https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/6e9ba129381949b3acfef16cee3adab1</p>\n<p>\u2022 <strong>32 Second Timer.</strong> Set as automation for when an alarm is stopped. Waits 16 seconds (so you can\u2019t immediately stop it) to set a 16 second timer. Makes an (optionally more annoying) timer go off 32 seconds after the original alarm. Change the numbers to suit you. Very simple, but helps me wake up and pay attention. https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/b918e837b7634f8e800207d846067be5</p>\n<p>\u2022 <strong>Choose Shortcut from list.</strong> Lists all of your Shortcuts alphabetically, and you can choose and run any of them. https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/857d658953d54e2683b68f634d72bf7c</p>\n<p>I also recommend using automations to change the battery percent at which low power mode is turned on and off. It saves tons of battery. I do: on at 60%, off at 65%.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br />\nSome of these require the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/actions/id1586435171\">Actions</a> and <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/toolbox-pro-for-shortcuts/id1476205977\">Toolbox Pro</a> apps to be installed, which add action options to the Shortcuts app. Both are free in the App Store.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br />\nSorry for the sheer volume. I hope someone finds one or more of these useful. They have been for me, and I wanted to share the wealth.</p>",

I used to meditate, journal, read, etc almost every morning. But now that I have a 4.5 month old things are a little different. I am just now getting some time back in the mornings and evenings but I find myself still struggling to do my calming routines. Instead, I just want to numb out and scroll on my phone.</p>\n<p>I am by no means a shortcut expert, so I am not sure if I created these in the best way (open to feedback) but I did really enjoy this little project making these two shortcuts that have helped me feel more calm when I wake up and go to sleep! Both shortcuts are linked at the bottom of this post.</p>\n<p>I had ChatGPT read me the shortcut functions in the style of a \u201cfriendly, encouraging spiritual friend\u201d but sometimes I have fun switching that out to something more fun, like Jesse Pinkman from Breaking Bad (YO YO YO!). Here is what each shortcut does:</p>\n<p><strong>Morning Routine</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Greets me</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reminds me to drink water</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tells me the current date</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Gives me a rundown of the weather for today (current temperature, high, low, chance of rain, and sunset time.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Gives me outfit ideas based on the weather.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Lets me know if there are any birthdays today (based on contacts)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reads me my upcoming events for today and tomorrow</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Gives me ideas for activities if there are no events scheduled</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reads me my reminders due today and overdue reminders</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reads me a daily bible verse</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reads me my Gemini horoscope</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tells me how long I slept last night and my \u201creadiness\u201d for the day based on the AutoSleep app data</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Encourages me to log my mood (using the log mood feature in the health app) and opens the health app, then gives me one minute to do so.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Encourages me to journal and gives me ideas for journal prompts. Opens the journal app and waits 5 minutes to give me time to journal. (Option to skip journaling as well)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Prompts me to read my morning affirmations by giving me the option to read on my own (opens up my notes app daily affirmations and waits 3 minutes) or have them read to me. (Option to skip affirmations as well).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Encourages me to choose one more activity to do: reading, which opens my kindle app, meditate, which opens my insight timer meditation app, or exercise, which gives me options and starts that exercise based on previously made shortcuts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Finally, it sends me off for the day with an encouraging message.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Night Time Routine</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Greets me</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Prompts me to pick a calming Spotify playlist from a list I made with some options, or play no music</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Encourages me to log my mood (using the log mood feature in the health app) and opens the health app, then gives me one minute to do so.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reads my upcoming events for tomorrow</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reads me the weather for tomorrow (high, low, chance of rain, sunrise time)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Encourages me to reflect on the day and list three things I enjoyed or was grateful for using the \u201cAsk Input\u201d feature, then saves my answer into my notes app</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Encourages me to choose a relaxing activity to do next: Binaural beats (opens my favorite YouTube channel for this), meditate (opens InsighTimer), or read (opens kindle app). Also encourages me to spend some time in prayer.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Wishes me a calm an peaceful night.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I am happy to share these but it is pretty personalized to me so you\u2019ll have to edit some things.

Despite this, the tracking stops working when airplane mode is turned on (by thief).</p>\n<p>This is where this automation comes in.</p>\n<p><strong>Function:</strong>\nWhen the Airplane mode is turned on, this automation asks for a password. When it\u2019s entered incorrectly, not within 3 seconds, or the prompt is dismissed. The phone automatically locks the screen, turns airplane mode back off and goes into low power mode with the screen brightness set to 0.</p>\n<p><strong>Setup:</strong>\nFor this to work you\u2019ll need ToolBox Pro.\nCreate the two automations (as shown in the picture). This makes sure that when the password request is not fulfilled that the other shortcuts that locks the screen and turns off Airplane mode still runs. (Otherwise the thief could easily disable this automation).</p>\n<p>Alternative to ToolBox Pro: It should be possible to create/read and edit a file or note and use this las the global variable.</p>\n<p><strong>Possible Improvements:</strong>\nIt would be cool if the phone would shut down, or restart when the password is not correct. Because a restarted phone needs the passcode to enter control center. So far, the action \u201crestart\u201d prompts the user and we can\u2019t have that here. For now I just set the notification center to not be accessible when the device is locked.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Those are automation shortcuts and thus not shareable through a link.</li>\n<li>I hope this helps u and feel free to write ur suggestions in the comments.</li>\n</ul>",

INTRODUCTION:</h2>\n<p>This simple shortcut is incredibly handy for anyone who's ever needed to copy or translate text directly from their iPhone screen. Sometimes, apps don't allow you to copy text from certain elements, or they insist you copy an entire post/comment/message when you only want a part of it (maybe just one or a few sentences). This shortcut is the solution to that problem. It lets you quickly take a screenshot that pops up in a Quick Look window.</p>\n<p>This screenshot is immediately available for you to use as needed, without saving it to your phone. You can effortlessly copy any text or translate the entire text area right from this temporary snapshot. The shortcut is easily triggered with a convenient back tap\u2014either 2 or 3, based on your preference.</p>\n<p>Using this shortcut has helped me avoid filling up my phone's storage with countless unnecessary screenshots. It's a simple yet effective solution for the annoying text copying problem, and I'm confident it can make your life easier too.</p>\n<h2>II. HOW TO USE:</h2>\n<h4>1. Set Up the Shortcut for the Back Tap feature</h4>\n<p>Assign this shortcut to the Back Tap feature in your iPhone settings. If you're already familiar with setting up Back Tap, simply choose this shortcut for either a Double Tap or Triple Tap.</p>\n<p><strong>For those new to Back Tap:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Accessibility</strong> &gt; <strong>Touch</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Scroll to <strong>Back Tap</strong> and choose this shortcut for either <strong>Double Tap</strong> or <strong>Triple Tap</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2. Copy or Translate Text from the temporary screenshot</h4>\n<p>After setting up Back Tap:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Activate the shortcut by double or triple tapping the back of your iPhone. A screenshot instantly appears in a Quick Look window.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>To copy text:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Touch and hold the text on the screenshot to select it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Adjust the selection handles if necessary and tap \"Copy.\"</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>To translate text:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Tap the \"Text\" icon, which is usually located near the bottom-right corner of the screen.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This will process the text areas on the screenshot for translation, similar to how you translate text in photos within the Photos app.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>3. Close the Quick Look Window</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Tap \u201cDone\u201d in the top-right corner to exit. The screenshot will not be saved unless you choose to do so.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If the \"Done\" button is not visible, tap the screenshot again to make the button reappear.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

It prompts a pause and suggests alternative activities when you try to open social media apps, adjusting its behavior based on the time of day. You can customize an optional off-work break period and specify how long you wish to use social media when prompted.</p>\n<p><strong>For experienced users:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Install the \"Social Media Detox\" shortcut.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Choose to enable/disable the optional off-work break (5:30 PM - 10:30 PM) during setup.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Set up an automation in the Shortcuts app to trigger this shortcut when opening social media apps.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To adjust the off-work break setting later, edit the second text box in the shortcut's actions.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Download it here (version 1.4)</p>\n<p>https://routinehub.co/shortcut/18244/</p>\n<p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p>\n<p><strong><em>COMPLETE DOCUMENTATION</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>I. INTRODUCTION</strong>:</p>\n<p>Introducing \"Social Media Detox\u201d, a shortcut designed to help you reduce excessive social media use and make your time more productive and meaningful.</p>\n<p><strong>How it Works:</strong></p>\n<p>\"Social Media Detox\" works with the automation feature of the Shortcuts app to activate every time you open a chosen social media app. Whenever triggered, the shortcut displays a full-screen Quick Look window that temporarily obscures the social media app, encouraging you to take a 10-second pause to read a thoughtful message. This message is intended to motivate you to use your time more constructively. You can dismiss the Quick Look window by tapping \"done.\"</p>\n<p><strong>After that, the shortcut\u2019s behavior adjusts accordingly to the time of the day:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>From 7:30 AM to 10:30 PM (with an optional break from 5:30 PM to 10:30 PM):</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>When you open a social media app during these hours, the shortcut suggests alternative, more meaningful activities. Suggestions include working out, meditating, learning something helpful, or enjoying the fresh air outside. If you choose one of these activities, the social media app closes, and a motivational quote related to your selected activity is displayed.</p>\n<p>There are two unique activity options:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\"Another meaningful activity\": This simply closes the app and presents a general motivational message.</li>\n<li>\"I still want to use social media for an important reason\": This option allows you to specify the duration of your social media use with preset time intervals, such as 10 minutes, 30 minutes, 2 hours, 4 hours, etc. You can also manually enter a custom time. The shortcut will not interrupt your social media use during the specified period. If you decide to stop using the app, select \"I have changed my mind. I want to close the app now.\"</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You also have the choice to set a daily break period from 5:30 PM to 10:30 PM, during which the \"Social Media Detox\" shortcut will not activate, allowing you to enjoy social media without interruption.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>After 10:30 PM:</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The shortcut's approach changes, no longer suggesting alternative activities but instead encouraging you to rest. Your options are limited to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Using social media for 10 minutes</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Using social media for 30 minutes.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>**The shortcut will not retrigger during the specified time</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>\"I want to sleep\": Selecting this closes the app, promoting a healthier sleep routine.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>From 12:00 AM to 4:00 AM (Important Sleep Period):</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>During these late-night hours, \"Social Limit\" strongly discourages social media use. Each attempt to access a social media app will prompt you to shut it down. If you choose to continue, the alert will reappear upon reopening or switching back to the app. The only way to disable this persistent reminder is by turning off the shortcut's automation.</p>\n<p>\u2014&gt; In short, \"Social Media Detox\" is a tool aimed at supporting you in achieving a healthier digital lifestyle by providing structured and thoughtful prompts to help you consciously reduce your social media time to live a more meaningful life.</p>\n<p><strong>II. HOW TO USE</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Short Version for Experienced Users:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add the \"Social Media Detox\" shortcut.</li>\n<li>During the initial setup promt, choose whether to enable the off-work break (5:30 PM - 10:30 PM) by entering <code>0</code> for no or <code>1</code> for yes.</li>\n<li>Set up an Automation in the Shortcuts app to run the shortcut \"Social Media Detox\" immediately upon opening the chosen social media apps.</li>\n<li>To toggle the off-work break on or off later, edit the second text box within in the shortcut\u2019s editing interface</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Detailed Guide for New Shortcuts Users:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Install &amp; set up the shortcut</strong></p>\n<p>1) Add the shortcut to the Shortcuts app on your iPhone.</p>\n<p>2) Upon adding, a prompt will appear asking you to set up the shortcut. You'll see a question: \"Would you like to set a break from 5:30 PM to 10:30 PM? Type the number <code>1</code> for yes or <code>0</code> for no in the text box below.\"</p>\n<p>3) Enter \u201c0\u201d if you don\u2019t want to have the break time, or \u201c1\u201d if you want it.</p>\n<p>**To create an automation for your apps: **</p>\n<p>1) Open the Shortcuts app and navigate to the 'Automation' tab.</p>\n<p>2) Tap the '+' icon in the top-right corner to create a new automation.</p>\n<p>3) Scroll down the list and choose 'App' </p>\n<p>4) In the \"When\" page, choose the social media apps you want to monitor from the app list provided.

With my current setup, Siri acts as my personal assistant, providing reminders for everything from a morning greeting to exercise, cleaning, meditation, and more, as the day progresses. This is all without me having to fo anything. This system has simplified my life, and I\u2019m excited to share my experience.</p>\n<p>What am I talking about? Upon waking, Siri greets me good morning, and shortly after, prompts me to meditate, even launching my meditation app. Following meditation, Siri suggests a shower, and then, reminds me to enjoy a 30-minute cleaning session, specifying the areas to clean that day. Before work begins, Siri alerts me 15 minutes in advance. At noon, Siri tells me it\u2019s time to break my fast, all orchestrated seamlessly by what feels like an autonomous smartphone assistant.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how I implemented this system: I first outlined my desired daily schedule on ChatGPT, focusing on becoming more productive, organized, and allocating time for exercise, cleaning, and relaxation. After refining this plan, I recognized the importance of having a timetable for routine tasks. I then created silent alarms in the Clock app for each voice reminder I wanted from Siri, labeling them for easy identification and setting them for specific days.</p>\n<p>For the voice reminders, I crafted speak text prompts in Shortcuts, tailoring Siri\u2019s announcements to my liking. Here are a few examples of the prompts I\u2019ve used:</p>\n<pre><code>\u2022   \u201cThe current time is 4:15. You have your daily walk in 30 minutes. Please change into your fitness clothing.\u201d\n\u2022   \u201cI hope you\u2019re feeling warm and relaxed after your shower because it\u2019s now time for your evening meditation. Remember, good sleep is as crucial as physical and mental health. Enjoy your meditation and sweet dreams.\u201d\n\u2022   \u201cHappy Hump Day. Let\u2019s make your bed, clean the entryway, start some laundry, and declutter as needed.\u201d\n</code></pre>\n<p>After creating these speak text commands, I customized the voice, pitch, and speed, and saved them. Then, I set up automations triggered by the silent alarms, attaching the corresponding speak text shortcuts to ensure that when the silent alarm goes off, Siri recites the prepared phrase.</p>\n<p>I chose alarms with no sound selection over calendar events for their user-friendly interface in selecting repetition options. This flexibility allows me to assign different cleaning tasks to specific days by linking them to the day\u2019s alarm. In the clock app you choose specific days of the week for your alarms too. This is great for tasks I only want occurring on the weekday versus weekend or weekly tasks.</p>\n<p>This approach helps immensely with my busy schedule, combating mental exhaustion by removing the burden of schedule management and task planning. I work full time, attend two classes, and work with a fitness coach, among other commitments. Living alone and working from home, this system suits me perfectly, though I recognize it may not be for everyone.</p>\n<p>For some tasks, I have Siri provide double prompts\u2014one 15 minutes before the task begins and another at the start time, allowing for creativity in managing my day.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019ve never done this please give it a go and tell me what you think about it. To me this makes my life feel very futuristic and I don\u2019t have to do anything with my phone after the initial set up. I hope this helps someone out if they are also dealing with a busy schedule or just feeling like life is pretty exhausting right now and just need a little help managing it all.</p>\n<p>Thanks for stopping by \u263a\ufe0f.</p>",

Later on, I found some apps that did this but didn't have support for many apps. This is where my app comes in! It lets you use a variety of themes and icons, and you can apply them with shortcuts to be used with any app. The app is called <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/iconic-app-icon-themer/id6454675338\">Iconic - App Icon Themer</a>, and although it includes a few themes for free, I'm going to be giving away a lifetime key to unlock all themes and future content!

I also feel setting up events via the menu feature of shortcuts is more user friendly, feels more smooth to set up an event.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve built this up so I can benefit from the Apple Maps feature with the Calendar app. I think that would be great something similar gets integrated into the Calendar app by Apple itself at some point, there\u2019s def some UX improvements they can do on that</p>\n<p>\ud83d\udd39How it works \nHere\u2019s how the shortcut works: \n1 - Event title\n2 - Set start and end event \n3 - Look up the address for your event (just directly click Ok if no address) \n3.1 - Once you have your location, click share then copy to copy the address, click Ok to confirm &amp; add the location for the event \n4 - Set yourself an alert, you have the none option (A second alert at time to leave is set by default as well to get to your location in time)\n5 - Add yourself a note if necessary (just click Ok if none)</p>\n<p>\ud83d\udd39Conclusion\nThat\u2019s it, your event is set up, with location, alerts and notes done so you stay organized and prepared</p>\n<p>\ud83d\udd39Feedback\nAnyway, have a look yourself and let me know what you think! I\u2019d love to get your feedback and if you think of additional features that should/could be added to it, please share with us your improvements</p>\n<p>Thank you!!</p>",

So i created an automation to log texts as they came in and before they get deleted, especially helpful when I'm not near my devices to try and see the text before it's deleted. </p>\n<p>Step 1. Create a note to act as your log and save it in whatever folder you want. If you rename it or move it later, you'll have to fit the automation to look for the new note/location. I called it Test Message Log for the image above. </p>\n<p>Step 2. Create an automation based on receiving a text from someone. Select the person (i used 'Test' in the image above) and any keywords you may want to use as filters. I left it blank so any message from them will be captured. Select 'Run immediately'. Hit next. </p>\n<p>Step 3. Select 'New blank automation'.</p>\n<p>Step 4. Search for and add the  'Get text from input' action. Select shortcut input as the variable. </p>\n<p>Step 5. Search for and add the 'Text' action.  Format the text as you would like it to appear in the note. Select the 'current date' variable and format it how you wish. Select the 'text' variable to get the text from Step 4 above.\n(I put in some dashes as a separator for the messages, a couple of stars around the date to make it stand out a bit). </p>\n<p>Step 6. Search for and add the 'Append to note' action. Set the variable to the text created in Step 5. Select the note you created in Step 1.  </p>\n<p>[I probably don't need the first 'get text from input' action and could just pass that text from the message right into the 'text' action. ]</p><div><br></div><img src=\"https://i.redd.it/bwiu1uueex6c1.jpeg\" />",

You can do this when your PC is completely off! Note- this guide is only for LOCAL remote starts. It's possible to do it remotely, but I won't be going over that in this post- it just takes some extra elbow grease!</p>\n<p>Things you'll need-</p>\n<p>-An apple device that can run shortcuts<br />\n-Ethernet connection from router to PC<br />\n-Wolow App  (I use the paid version, not sure if the free one let's you do the same thing)<br />\n-Wolow Companion App for PC (Not required, but nice if you want to remote shut-down/restart your PC as well)<br />\n<a href=\"https://wolow.site/\">Wolow - Wake on LAN</a> (They have their own guide as well!)  </p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Make sure WOL is enabled for your PC (I had to go into bios and enable \" Power On By PCI-E\"). You may have to open your ethernet adapter properties-&gt;networking-&gt;configure-&gt;advanced-&gt;Enable Wake on Magic Packet  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>BE SURE YOUR PC HAS A STATIC IP ADDRESS, OTHERWISE YOU'LL HAVE TO CONSTANTLY UPDATE IT MANUALLY. I bumped into issues when I assigned it in my network settings <strong>on my PC</strong>, so instead I opened my <strong>router settings</strong> and reserved the IP under the \"devices\" section for my PC.(This will vary from one router to another, you'll just have to google how to do this for your own)<br />\n<strong>Note:</strong> I'm not sure if WOLOW companion automatically updates the IP address of your device. If it does, then I guess you can just skip step 2, unless you want to setup a remote start outside of your local network.  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If I remember correctly, if you use the paid version with Wolow Companion, you can just press \"Scan Network\" in the Wolow App, and it should automatically fill in the information for whichever PC it finds on your network. If this is the case for you, then skip to step 6- If not, go to step 4!  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Note the following information (Can be found by doing \"ipconfig /all\" in the command prompt )--MAC &amp; IP Address of the computer you want to remote start-Ping Address (IPv4 address)-Wake on LAN (WoL) port, which is usually 9,7, or 0 (9 is most common)  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Open up the Wolow app, add new device, type in the information from step 3 (You can name it whatever you want)  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you did everything correctly, once you have your device selected, it should show the awake status as \"Awake\" and give you a response time on the right. It will now start when you press the power button in the middle!  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Go into your shortcuts app, create a new shortcut, select \"Wake up device\", choose your PC on the selection screen, rename the shortcut to whatever you want!(You don't HAVE to rename the shortcut- I only did so I can just say \"Siri, <strong>Start my PC</strong>\"- do whatever you want though!)<br />\n<strong>Note:</strong> You can also create a shutdown shortcut, though you need the Wolow Companion app in order for it to work.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Hopefully this guide helps some of you! If you guys have any questions just let me know, I'll try my best to answer them!</p>\n<p>Edit: Formatting</p>",
