If you\u2019re connected to WiFi, and you run this shortcut, cellular data will be turned off to preserve battery and WiFi will be left on. Same applies to vice versa.</p>\n<p>Comments detailing each section of the shortcut so that you can (somewhat) tinker with the shortcut and suit it to your needs, if need be.</p>\n<p>Slow execution time, I don\u2019t know how to speed it up, since it goes through so many checks, but it\u2019s not too slow and it works.</p>\n<p>Initial setup menu, allowing you to toggle individually what you want to be toggled when running the shortcut, such as Bluetooth, airplane mode, and various other features that this shortcut has.</p>\n<p>Config reset protocol. Previously, you had to manually look up the config folder in files and then manually delete it, but now all you have to do is set both your volume and brightness to maximum and your focus to Driving, and run the shortcut. After that, a prompt will appear to delete the config folder. This will help you decide which setup option is best for you in an easy way.</p>\n<p>Advanced charging, where you can choose to fully power up your phone when charging, display a notification when your battery reaches 80%, so that you can preserve your battery health, and show a rough estimate of when your battery is gonna be fully charged.</p>\n<p>This shortcut does not require you to install any third party app, and was made to work on any iPhone model having iOS 16+. I\u2019ve been using this shortcut on my 14 for a year now, and I\u2019ve been very satisfied with it since it works without issues, which is also why I believe this will be the last update for it.</p>\n<p>Install: https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/4239cb6be5e246f1acd02a7e84988cd7</p>\n<p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS</strong></p>\n<p>Run the shortcut, go through the setup process, then go to automations and create 3 automations. One for when low power mode is turned on or off, one when the battery level is at 80% (not less and not more, just when it\u2019s specifically 80%) and one where your phone is connected / disconnected from power. Insert a \u201cRun shortcut\u201d action into each of them, and select the advanced low power mode shortcut. That\u2019s it!</p>\n<p>Edit:</p>\n<p>If you do use this shortcut, please take some time and leave a comment. It would make my day seeing that the shortcut I\u2019ve put months of work into is getting some recognition (previously it hasn\u2019t done very well) and do tell what you would like to see improved in the shortcut.</p></div>",

This allows the Action Button to have multiple Shortcuts associated with it, and have a shortcut executed by pressing 1x, 2x or 3x on the Action Button. For users without an iPhone 15 Pro (Max), there is an alternative by placing a shortcut on your home screen. The explanation of how to install this is described in this article (perfectly translatable via your browser).</p>\n<p>Setting up Shortcuts requires several steps, sorry for that. It is a very comprehensive shortcut that works with Focus mode and the Files app to temporarily save data.</p>\n<p>You can find the explanation how to install the shortcuts here: <a href=\"https://www.appletips.nl/actieknop-iphone-uitbreiden/\">https://www.appletips.nl/actieknop-iphone-uitbreiden/</a> (article is in Dutch, but you can translate it via your browser)</p>\n<p>I am curious to hear what you guys think of my Shortcut.</p></div>",

Turning mute on provides double tap haptic feedback, turning mute off provide single tap haptic feedback. </p>\n<p>-If the iPhone is in landscape left orientation (dynamic island on the left), it will immediately launch the camera app in photo mode when pressing the action button. </p>\n<p>-I have two duplicate menus setup (screenshot above), one menu is shown when NO focus mode is enabled, and another menu when ANY focus mode is enabled. This could easily be modified as needed for specific focus mode names. I just duplicated all the menu items as a demo. The menu is only shown if the device is NOT in either of the orientations above that directly launch mute/camera. </p>\n<p>- \"Climate On\" is for Tesla cars, and will automatically turn on climate control to the existing setting. </p>\n<p>-The main action button shortcut relies on the \"Super mute\" shortcut.</p>\n<p>-The shortcut also relies on the free \"Actions\" iPhone app for additional shortcut actions.</p>\n<p>Main shortcut: <a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/cdee391a4bc94aeb8fd0c863b0dd20b0\">https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/cdee391a4bc94aeb8fd0c863b0dd20b0</a></p>\n<p>Super Mute shortcut: <a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/e19a628546b94634a7450c450a52b577\">https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/e19a628546b94634a7450c450a52b577</a></p>\n<p>iOS Actions App (free): <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/actions/id1586435171\">https://apps.apple.com/us/app/actions/id1586435171</a></p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p></div>",
