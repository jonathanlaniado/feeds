I hope you're all doing well. I wanted to share one of my recent projects with you. I\u2019ve developed a set of shortcuts to help me efficiently track and manage my car\u2019s mileage. </p>\n<p>The mileage tracking is automated using Drivey, which starts recording as soon as my phone connects to CarPlay. This data is then processed and stored in a Data Jar list, where it is compared against a predefined oil change limit. This setup allows me to monitor when I\u2019m approaching the oil change threshold and receive notifications if I exceed it. When an oil change is performed, the shortcuts provide an option to reset the cycle and start fresh.</p>\n<p>Additionally, each month\u2019s mileage data is stored separately in a dedicated folder on my phone for easy reference and control.</p>\n<p>The Mileage Shortcut system is divided into three parts, which I\u2019ll outline below:</p>\n<p>1- Daily Mileage Update: https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/f61240978b304ff7886a9edd2afaf11a</p>\n<p>2-Mileage Database: https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/cee4c112ac0e4840a3677bfd2a8a7359</p>\n<p>3-Maintenance Report: https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/c923c211f269435aae4052503d17432c</p>\n<p>Let me know what you think and if there is anything I can help with setting it up let me know.</p>\n<p>Best regards</p>\n<p>Created by Agenor Maradiaga<br />\nLinkedIn: http://linkedin.com/in/agenor-maradiaga-6410471a6  <br />\nEmail: amaradiagad26@gmail.com<br />\n\u00a9 2024 All rights reserved.</p><div><br></div><img src=\"https://i.redd.it/vgxu4otaai1e1.jpeg\" />",

Is this overly-complicated? Yes. Is this likely unnecessary? Yes. Overkill? Definitely. Was it worth it? Absolutely!</p>\n<p>I wanted to make a shortcut for my action button that I would find useful regardless of the scenario I was in. This mainly came down to location so that was the main motivator here. </p>\n<p>I have my action button set to run the \u201cAction Button\u201d shortcut. It then checks if my phone is facing down. If it is then it toggles the flashlight. This is because you never know when you need a flashlight, but when you do you don\u2019t want to be messing with menus or anything. Quick, easy, simple. Then we check to see where the device is located so we can bring up so more context-related menus. That\u2019s where the \u201cLocation Category\u201d shortcut is ran which is the real meat and potatoes of this shortcut. </p>\n<p>I won\u2019t go into too much detail for the sake of my fingers, but it basically has a list of locations in a dictionary that I\u2019m interested in making a menu for. Each of those entries has a \u201cquery\u201d which is used to find that location with maps, as well as a tolerance which is the radius (in miles) of how close I have to be to make location\u2019s menu trigger. You may ask, \u201cwhy not just put a specified address for each of those locations and call it a day?\u201d Well to answer that, it\u2019s because I would like these menus to pop up no matter what location I\u2019m at, regardless of what gym, grocery store, movie theater, Walmart, etc. I decide to visit. With this approach, any location I\u2019m interested in making a menu for will always be covered under these general queries. Continuing on, the lower \u201crepeat with each\u201d block loops through each of the locations in the dictionary and queries maps with their respective \u201cquery\u201d and returns the closest x locations to me. Then with each of those it checks their distance from my current location. If it lies within the tolerance, I must be at that location. It will then return the location category back to the action button shortcut so it can run that specific menu. </p>\n<p>The upper \u201crepeat with each\u201d is a sort of caching mechanism and is a consequence of the overall querying taking a tad too long for my liking, especially at locations where service is spotty. It didn\u2019t ever take terribly long but I felt like when pushing the action button I should be able to see a menu right away and get to where I want to go with no time wasted. It basically looks for its cache file and loops through the lines, each of which with the format \u201ccategory:latitude,longitude\u201d, and compares it to my current location\u2019s latitude and longitude completely offline. It does this with the haversine formula which is accurate enough for this use case. If a match isn\u2019t found in the cache then it continues with the lower \u201crepeat with each\u201d block as previously explained and adds that location to the cache for faster access next time. This in practice cuts a whole lot of time off of the location checking and makes things almost instant. If a match isn\u2019t found then it returns nothing.</p>\n<p>Returning back to the \u201cAction Button\u201d shortcut, if something is returned from the \u201cLocation Category\u201d shortcut then it runs that category\u2019s menu. If nothing is returned then no match was found for the location and it simply opens the utility menu. The menus themselves contain actions that I might find useful in that scenario. Some are unfinished but it\u2019s a work in progress (always is).</p>\n<p>I tried mapping out the shortcut as best I could in the diagram in terms of control flow. Sorry for any fuzziness on the smaller fonts, it\u2019s the best I could do. Lots of work getting this idea to work (probably a little too much). Let me know if you have any questions!</p><div><br></div><img src=\"https://i.redd.it/gh6ll5impkzd1.jpeg\" />",

I\u2019ve tried to remedy this by adjusting \u201cAuto Lock\u201d to \u201cNever\u201d (I do this via the \u201cAuto Lock\u201d shortcut at the beginning of the sequence; this is a simple URL action shortcut). Even after setting auto lock to \u201cNever\u201d after the audio recording begins the screen will darken and turn off after about 30 seconds. I can prevent this by tapping the screen just in time but this is difficult to do while having a conversation. </p>\n<p>Does anyone know of any solutions or work around for this problem?

(Hence not going into more details)</li>\n<li>Once everything is set up, search for the 'Nothing' action in the search bar below and add it.</li>\n<li>Tap &amp; hold the \u2018Nothing\u2019 action and drag it to the first position.</li>\n<li>You are all set. No more annoying shortcut banner when opening an app with a custom icon.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>P.S. I wanted to share a video walkthrough but couldn\u2019t due to community guidelines.

The wallpapers are sourced from a dedicated album named \"Wallpaper Collection\", which contains only images suitable for wallpapers. This approach helps users easily select and set wallpapers, and quickly switch between multiple wallpapers in the album whenever desired.</p>\n<h2>Quick Setup Steps</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Create an album named \"Wallpaper Collection\" in your Photos app.</li>\n<li>Add images suitable for wallpapers to this album. You can start with just a few and add more later as needed.</li>\n<li>Run the shortcut and choose the feature you want to use.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong><em>Example of a \"Wallpaper Collection\" album:</em></strong></p>\n<p>[See the attached image of this post for a visual example]</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Select a single wallpaper for both Lock Screen and Home Screen</li>\n<li>Choose different wallpapers for Lock Screen and Home Screen sequentially</li>\n<li>Set Lock Screen wallpaper individually</li>\n<li>Set Home Screen wallpaper individually</li>\n<li>View the current wallpaper pair in the selected slot</li>\n<li>Easily switch between different wallpaper slots</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Some special types of wallpaper slots do not allow the shortcut to change wallpapers. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Photo Shuffle (e.g., shuffling between multiple wallpapers on the lock screen by tapping)</li>\n<li>Astronomy</li>\n<li>Kaleidoscope</li>\n<li>Emoji</li>\n<li>Apple may add more special wallpaper types in the future that can't be changed by shortcuts.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In some wallpaper slots, users may unintentionally enable certain options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>\"Pair\" option</strong>: When enabled, this makes the Home Screen wallpaper match the Lock Screen wallpaper. This affects the \"Select Lock Screen wallpaper\" feature, preventing separate Lock Screen wallpaper changes. If \"pair\" is enabled, selecting the wallpaper for only the Lock Screen will also change the Home Screen to have the same wallpaper. To resolve this, uncheck the \"pair\" option.</li>\n<li><strong>\"Blur\" option</strong>: When enabled, the Home Screen wallpaper becomes blurred. For a clear Home Screen view, uncheck this option.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Compatibility</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Requires iOS 16 or later</li>\n<li>Works on iPhone and iPad</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Feedback</h2>\n<p>If you encounter any issues, please leave a comment below.

The fast analysis coupled with the friendly and cool webpage UI provides a professional feeling and entertaining time. </p>\n<p>Along with showing your most played musical media, Top Tunes has a Quick Lists summary page, condensing the data into screenshot-able and shareable content (perfect to brag to your friends!). Finally, there is a consistency page which shows your artists and albums with the top average plays per song.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>The most consistent albums and artists are those with the highest average playcount per song. To qualify as an album, it must contain at least 8 songs, ensuring that a single with a high playcount doesn't overshadow a full album. Similarly, an artist must have at least 25 songs to be considered, preventing a one-hit-wonder with a high-playcount single from being the most consistent artist.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This shortcut may glitch out the first couple of times running it. You will get several notifications saying <strong>Allow \u201cTop Tunes\u201d to open \u201cSafari\u201d with 3000+ music items</strong>. It is important to click <strong>Always Allow</strong> so the shortcut runs smoothly from then on. Note that this shortcut does not use internet at all, so if you feel uncomfortable with the possibility of this shortcut stealing and sharing this data, feel free to turn your wifi off for added peace of mind. You can also review the shortcut code, but I guarantee it is safe to download and use.</p>\n<h2>Customization</h2>\n<p>There are a few ways to customize the shortcut to better tailor your needs. All of these customizations are within the shortcut. They can be found by editing the shortcut and reading its comments. </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Places Shown</strong> (defaults to 15): This is the number of top songs/artists/albums to show. It defaults to the top 15.</li>\n<li><strong>AVERAGE_ALBUM_THRESHOLD</strong> (defaults to 8): This is the number of songs an album must have to be considered for the most consistent albums. There needs to be a threshold, because otherwise an album with only two songs, both of which are highly played, would overshadow a complete album for average playcount per song.</li>\n<li><strong>AVERAGE_ARTIST_THRESHOLD</strong> (defaults to 25): This is the number of songs an artist must have to be considered for the most consistent artists. There needs to be a threshold because otherwise, a one-hit-wonder with one highly played song could overshadow one of your favourite artists for average playcount per song.</li>\n<li><strong>Album Cover Resizing</strong>: For the visual webpage, albums are resized to either 200x200 (for large album display) and 50x50 (for small album display). However, if you have a larger device, the images may be blurry. To fix this, you can increase the album resizing (these options are in the middle of the shortcut).<blockquote>\n<p><em>Note: increasing </em><em>Places Shown</em><em> or </em><em>Album Cover Resizing</em><em> will result in more data handled, which may cause the shortcut to glitch out.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Note: This shortcut may not work for everyone due to the massive amount of data handled and the device it runs on.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Is it glitching out or failing due to some error?</strong></p>\n<p>Top Tunes throws a massive amount of data around to generate the stats and album images. This immense information may cause the shortcut break. You can try several things to fix this:\n- Rerun the shortcut\n- Restart your phone.\n- Near the top of the shortcut, there is a Number action defaulting to 15. This is the number of songs/artists/albums to show in the top list. Setting the number lower, like the top 10, will use less data, so the shortcut may work.\n- In the middle of the shortcut, album covers are resized to either 200x200 for large images or 50x50 for small images. If you resize them smaller, the shortcut may work.</p>\n<p><strong>Does the webpage look bad?</strong></p>\n<p>The webpage is mobile-designed, meaning it may not look the best on an iPad or iMac. If you have any concerns or advice, feel free to contact me.</p>\n<p><strong>Is the data shifted around so the album covers, song titles, and artist names don't match?</strong></p>\n<p>The shortcut only works when every song has a title, album, artist, and album cover. Sometimes, downloaded audio files will be saved to your Apple Music (mostly on the Mac). If this is the case, they may mess up the data. In this case, your best bet would be to try it on your phone instead or delete the audio files.</p>\n<p><strong>Why were two artists conjoined?</strong></p>\n<p>There is absolutely no way to differentiate between artists with the same name. So if you have two artists named Bill Evans, they will sadly be assumed the same artist, and their discography will be combined.</p>\n<p><strong>Feedback</strong>\nI always welcome feedback, suggestions, and other feature requests.</p>\n<p>- Wesley Ormsby</p>",

Should you choose to lock an app behind Face ID and I\u2019m assuming Touch ID as I can\u2019t test that, that your automations set for actions of that app may not work due to needing the authentication. This is if you\u2019re using the new option to Require Face ID to open an app byway of tapping and holding onto an app icon on your Home Screen or App Library and selecting the new option.</p>\n<p>So for example, if you rely on the Files app to store and retrieve variables within .txt files at a scheduled time and you're not using your device, your automation will fail if you've locked the Files app behind Face ID.</p>\n<p>Using the Toolbox Pro and Actions app ways of \u201clocking an app\u201d is not affected by this other than to actually open the app, but also isn\u2019t a solid secure way of doing so. </p>",

Instagram offers the option to share content with others providing a link. That link contains a share id which makes it possible to track the usage back to you. So when my friend clicks on the link meta knows that he is connected with me.</p>\n<p>Removing the share id is fairly simple but also stupid work when you have to do it every time by yourself. So i created a shortcut that removes the share id and copies the link to my clipboard.</p>\n<p>Maybe it helps somebody. :)</p>\n<p>Cheers</p><div><br></div><img src=\"https://i.redd.it/b602rj706w7d1.jpeg\" />",

Natural Calendar takes your voice input in natural language, transcribes it, and uses the ChatGPT app to create calendar events instantly. Just describe your day, and watch your calendar populate in seconds!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Supports relative time references like \u201ctonight,\u201d \u201cin 2 days,\u201d or \u201cin an hour\u201d.</li>\n<li>Powered by GPT-3.5 (by default) for fast and reliable output</li>\n<li>Requires the ChatGPT app on your Mac, iPad, iPhone, or Apple Vision</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can say things like: \u201cSchedule my jog at 7 AM tomorrow, a team meeting at 3 PM on Thursday, and dinner with Sarah at 8 PM next Friday. Also, book a doctor\u2019s appointment for next Monday at 10 AM.\", and it will add it your calendar.</p>\n<p>Natural Calendar is now available for free in the iTech Everything Siri Shortcut Collection. I can\u2019t wait for you to try it out and save time in your planning workflow!</p>\n<p>A demo of Natural Calendar in action is included in the announcement post on my website \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffb</p>\n<p>Read more from the announcement<a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/4a6b12e7424e4c4da274d027736e2073\">:</a> <a href=\"https://www.itecheverything.com/post/introducing-natural-calendar-use-natural-language-to-schedule-your-day\">https://www.itecheverything.com/post/introducing-natural-calendar-use-natural-language-to-schedule-your-day</a></p>\n<p>Install it by clicking <a href=\"http://itecheverything.com/natural-calendar\">here</a>.</p>",

Most are very simple actions. They range from talking to AI, to rolling D&amp;D dice, to background noises, to finding a lost phone. I did not author all of these, only some, and some were borrowed and then altered. </p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br />\n\u2022 <strong>Backup Shortcuts.</strong> Takes all your Shortcuts and puts them in a .zip file in your iCloud Drive. You can then unzip and recover Shortcuts individually if anything has gone wrong with any or all of them (like when I edit one and accidentally delete half of it). https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/1da201ddc03146ecaaffa1d820a0c3fb</p>\n<p>\u2022 <strong>ChatGPT Voice Chat.</strong> This quickly opens the ChatGPT app to the voice chat page. It\u2019s literally one step, but I find it most useful added as a \u201cback tap\u201d action, so that tapping the phone talks to ChatGPT. Sharing for that reason. https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/01c08a4b200444ef974234344ab690ad</p>\n<p>\u2022 <strong>Pro AI.</strong> Someone\u2019s ChatGPT voice bot without the app. https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/cbe8040cc8824975a69d53699255191a</p>\n<p>\u2022 <strong>Gemini.</strong> AI powered by Google\u2019s Gemini. Can accept text, voice, images, and files. https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/4ee97df41eef4782a14d89c35b39f98c</p>\n<p>\u2022 <strong>Google Lens.</strong> Get Google Lens on your iPhone. Search for whatever is on your screen. Requires Google app. https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/98763a5ae2a440ef98f9d8eba95f3338</p>\n<p>\u2022 <strong>Find Nearest Hospital.</strong> Gets your location and quickly outputs the nearest hospitals. Gives various options to get there: walking, driving, transit, various ride share apps. For ride share, it then adds the address to the clipboard and opens that app. Author\u2019s name is in the notes. One of the actions says it won\u2019t be supported in future versions. If anyone knows how to fix it that\u2019d be great. It works for now. https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/6cb4117f9ac64812ba40d09e0409b0ac</p>\n<p>\u2022 <strong>Randomizer.</strong> Generates random numbers from atmospheric noise. Generates coin flips, dice rolls, playing card hands, first and last names, hex colors, or random items from a list you enter. Requires the other Shortcut \u201cMulti-Dice\u201d to do dice rolls. I\u2019ll fix that some day. https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/dbb7a566a151458ea873f7ce68c9c092</p>\n<p>\u2022 <strong>Multi-Dice Roll.</strong> Simulates rolling multiple dice with any number of sides. https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/a4a9bc9135254edcaa8d9cf5e71b8e70</p>\n<p>\u2022 <strong>D&amp;D Dice.</strong> Same as Multi-Dice Roll, but with added Advantage and Disadvantage (rolling twice and taking the higher or lower number) for Dungeons and Dragons. https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/aed105c0dfe145d6b593333923c354bd</p>\n<p>\u2022 <strong>Background Sounds On/Off.</strong> Lets you choose a background sound (rain, stream, various white noises) to turn on, or turn off the sound. This is usually buried in Accessibility settings. https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/a0676ddf48b94d4cbd8b6dba34bcd24a</p>\n<p>\u2022 <strong>4 Hour Background Noise.</strong> Turns on background noise for 4 hours and then stops. https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/2674bffe233b4b41ac9a5c10f8016b10. For now it depends on this other Shortcut for the waiting time: https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/06993ff0bfd945029c2bc24791a757da. They shouldn\u2019t be too hard to combine; I just haven\u2019t.</p>\n<p>\u2022 <strong>Toggle VPN.</strong> Toggles VPN, then repeatedly checks until it has finished connecting and then displays \u201cConnected,\u201d or in the other case \u201cDisconnected.\u201d You\u2019ll have to replace the Connect and Disconnect actions (there\u2019s only 1 of each) with those for your particular VPN. If there\u2019s a better way to check when it connects besides excessive waiting and checking, please share! https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/db5956f536a0488cae3e302b1b0337d8</p>\n<p>\u2022 <strong>Where Are You?.</strong> If you can\u2019t find your phone, but it might be nearby, this will make it speak and play a loud alarm. Use with \u201cHey Siri\u201d voice activation (\u201cHey Siri, where are you?\u201d) https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/bbd654e76cd94d5e87c460818801d955</p>\n<p>\u2022 <strong>I Found You.</strong> Use after finding the phone after using \u201cWhere are you?\u201d Returns volume to normal and ends alarm. Change volume number as you please. https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/2bbff787e691454a91fee0224c413e63</p>\n<p>\u2022 <strong>I\u2019m Getting Pulled Over.</strong> For police interactions and more. Dims the screen and begins recording from the front camera. When you end recording (manually), it texts the video to who you choose when you first set it up and uploads it to iCloud or wherever you choose. You\u2019ll have to fill in the contact and save location before using. https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/109c41acb51e40b8803642ad8d34bf9f</p>\n<p>\u2022 <strong>What\u2019s the Speed Limit?</strong> Gets the speed limit for the road you\u2019re on. https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/af01647a5bf148d5aab6b65fbf9c77e9</p>\n<p>\u2022  <strong>Text Above Picture.</strong> Adds text above a chosen image. https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/5768d012cb2746c985774152c655642d</p>\n<p>\u2022 <strong>Live Photo to GIF.</strong> Turns selected Live Photo to a GIF. https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/d64947db613349cbaeb8570081589a39</p>\n<p>\u2022 <strong>Save File As.</strong> Choose what to save a file as. https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/3c990a57edf9466b9131996067daecb5</p>\n<p>\u2022 <strong>All Media Downloader.</strong> Downloads media from various sites, including Reddit, via the Share Sheet. https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/d1d14ea3cb264f3d9f52a6b4ccd5165b</p>\n<p><strong>Apple News to Safari.</strong> Opens Apple News pages in Safari. https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/5ddddee2ead94fedb6b6f650ef7ce3f8</p>\n<p>\u2022 <strong>Face ID App Locker.</strong> Set as automation when opening a particular app. Brings up the Lock Screen when opening that app, preventing someone without the Face ID or password from seeing its contents (may be visible for a second or two). Set the re-lock interval to the number of minutes you want it to wait before locking again. Sometimes this interval doesn\u2019t work, and it locks every time. If anyone knows a fix, please share! https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/6e9ba129381949b3acfef16cee3adab1</p>\n<p>\u2022 <strong>32 Second Timer.</strong> Set as automation for when an alarm is stopped. Waits 16 seconds (so you can\u2019t immediately stop it) to set a 16 second timer. Makes an (optionally more annoying) timer go off 32 seconds after the original alarm. Change the numbers to suit you. Very simple, but helps me wake up and pay attention. https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/b918e837b7634f8e800207d846067be5</p>\n<p>\u2022 <strong>Choose Shortcut from list.</strong> Lists all of your Shortcuts alphabetically, and you can choose and run any of them. https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/857d658953d54e2683b68f634d72bf7c</p>\n<p>I also recommend using automations to change the battery percent at which low power mode is turned on and off. It saves tons of battery. I do: on at 60%, off at 65%.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br />\nSome of these require the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/actions/id1586435171\">Actions</a> and <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/toolbox-pro-for-shortcuts/id1476205977\">Toolbox Pro</a> apps to be installed, which add action options to the Shortcuts app. Both are free in the App Store.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br />\nSorry for the sheer volume. I hope someone finds one or more of these useful. They have been for me, and I wanted to share the wealth.</p>",

I used to meditate, journal, read, etc almost every morning. But now that I have a 4.5 month old things are a little different. I am just now getting some time back in the mornings and evenings but I find myself still struggling to do my calming routines. Instead, I just want to numb out and scroll on my phone.</p>\n<p>I am by no means a shortcut expert, so I am not sure if I created these in the best way (open to feedback) but I did really enjoy this little project making these two shortcuts that have helped me feel more calm when I wake up and go to sleep! Both shortcuts are linked at the bottom of this post.</p>\n<p>I had ChatGPT read me the shortcut functions in the style of a \u201cfriendly, encouraging spiritual friend\u201d but sometimes I have fun switching that out to something more fun, like Jesse Pinkman from Breaking Bad (YO YO YO!). Here is what each shortcut does:</p>\n<p><strong>Morning Routine</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Greets me</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reminds me to drink water</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tells me the current date</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Gives me a rundown of the weather for today (current temperature, high, low, chance of rain, and sunset time.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Gives me outfit ideas based on the weather.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Lets me know if there are any birthdays today (based on contacts)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reads me my upcoming events for today and tomorrow</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Gives me ideas for activities if there are no events scheduled</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reads me my reminders due today and overdue reminders</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reads me a daily bible verse</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reads me my Gemini horoscope</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tells me how long I slept last night and my \u201creadiness\u201d for the day based on the AutoSleep app data</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Encourages me to log my mood (using the log mood feature in the health app) and opens the health app, then gives me one minute to do so.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Encourages me to journal and gives me ideas for journal prompts. Opens the journal app and waits 5 minutes to give me time to journal. (Option to skip journaling as well)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Prompts me to read my morning affirmations by giving me the option to read on my own (opens up my notes app daily affirmations and waits 3 minutes) or have them read to me. (Option to skip affirmations as well).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Encourages me to choose one more activity to do: reading, which opens my kindle app, meditate, which opens my insight timer meditation app, or exercise, which gives me options and starts that exercise based on previously made shortcuts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Finally, it sends me off for the day with an encouraging message.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Night Time Routine</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Greets me</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Prompts me to pick a calming Spotify playlist from a list I made with some options, or play no music</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Encourages me to log my mood (using the log mood feature in the health app) and opens the health app, then gives me one minute to do so.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reads my upcoming events for tomorrow</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reads me the weather for tomorrow (high, low, chance of rain, sunrise time)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Encourages me to reflect on the day and list three things I enjoyed or was grateful for using the \u201cAsk Input\u201d feature, then saves my answer into my notes app</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Encourages me to choose a relaxing activity to do next: Binaural beats (opens my favorite YouTube channel for this), meditate (opens InsighTimer), or read (opens kindle app). Also encourages me to spend some time in prayer.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Wishes me a calm an peaceful night.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I am happy to share these but it is pretty personalized to me so you\u2019ll have to edit some things. Let me know if you have any more ideas for these! I absolutely LOVE making these. It gave me a fun little project to do during my daughter\u2019s naps haha.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/7cc58db3770a4ca4a1de26759c8753cf\">Morning Briefing</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/6efe1c66951c45e799076938832c0123\">Goodnight</a></p>",

Despite this, the tracking stops working when airplane mode is turned on (by thief).</p>\n<p>This is where this automation comes in.</p>\n<p><strong>Function:</strong>\nWhen the Airplane mode is turned on, this automation asks for a password. When it\u2019s entered incorrectly, not within 3 seconds, or the prompt is dismissed. The phone automatically locks the screen, turns airplane mode back off and goes into low power mode with the screen brightness set to 0.</p>\n<p><strong>Setup:</strong>\nFor this to work you\u2019ll need ToolBox Pro.\nCreate the two automations (as shown in the picture). This makes sure that when the password request is not fulfilled that the other shortcuts that locks the screen and turns off Airplane mode still runs. (Otherwise the thief could easily disable this automation).</p>\n<p>Alternative to ToolBox Pro: It should be possible to create/read and edit a file or note and use this las the global variable.</p>\n<p><strong>Possible Improvements:</strong>\nIt would be cool if the phone would shut down, or restart when the password is not correct. Because a restarted phone needs the passcode to enter control center. So far, the action \u201crestart\u201d prompts the user and we can\u2019t have that here. For now I just set the notification center to not be accessible when the device is locked.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Those are automation shortcuts and thus not shareable through a link.</li>\n<li>I hope this helps u and feel free to write ur suggestions in the comments.</li>\n</ul>",

INTRODUCTION:</h2>\n<p>This simple shortcut is incredibly handy for anyone who's ever needed to copy or translate text directly from their iPhone screen. Sometimes, apps don't allow you to copy text from certain elements, or they insist you copy an entire post/comment/message when you only want a part of it (maybe just one or a few sentences). This shortcut is the solution to that problem. It lets you quickly take a screenshot that pops up in a Quick Look window.</p>\n<p>This screenshot is immediately available for you to use as needed, without saving it to your phone. You can effortlessly copy any text or translate the entire text area right from this temporary snapshot. The shortcut is easily triggered with a convenient back tap\u2014either 2 or 3, based on your preference.</p>\n<p>Using this shortcut has helped me avoid filling up my phone's storage with countless unnecessary screenshots. It's a simple yet effective solution for the annoying text copying problem, and I'm confident it can make your life easier too.</p>\n<h2>II. HOW TO USE:</h2>\n<h4>1. Set Up the Shortcut for the Back Tap feature</h4>\n<p>Assign this shortcut to the Back Tap feature in your iPhone settings. If you're already familiar with setting up Back Tap, simply choose this shortcut for either a Double Tap or Triple Tap.</p>\n<p><strong>For those new to Back Tap:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Accessibility</strong> &gt; <strong>Touch</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Scroll to <strong>Back Tap</strong> and choose this shortcut for either <strong>Double Tap</strong> or <strong>Triple Tap</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2. Copy or Translate Text from the temporary screenshot</h4>\n<p>After setting up Back Tap:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Activate the shortcut by double or triple tapping the back of your iPhone. A screenshot instantly appears in a Quick Look window.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>To copy text:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Touch and hold the text on the screenshot to select it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Adjust the selection handles if necessary and tap \"Copy.\"</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>To translate text:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Tap the \"Text\" icon, which is usually located near the bottom-right corner of the screen.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This will process the text areas on the screenshot for translation, similar to how you translate text in photos within the Photos app.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>3. Close the Quick Look Window</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Tap \u201cDone\u201d in the top-right corner to exit. The screenshot will not be saved unless you choose to do so.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If the \"Done\" button is not visible, tap the screenshot again to make the button reappear.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

It prompts a pause and suggests alternative activities when you try to open social media apps, adjusting its behavior based on the time of day. You can customize an optional off-work break period and specify how long you wish to use social media when prompted.</p>\n<p><strong>For experienced users:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Install the \"Social Media Detox\" shortcut.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Choose to enable/disable the optional off-work break (5:30 PM - 10:30 PM) during setup.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Set up an automation in the Shortcuts app to trigger this shortcut when opening social media apps.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To adjust the off-work break setting later, edit the second text box in the shortcut's actions.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Download it here (version 1.4)</p>\n<p>https://routinehub.co/shortcut/18244/</p>\n<p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p>\n<p><strong><em>COMPLETE DOCUMENTATION</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>I. INTRODUCTION</strong>:</p>\n<p>Introducing \"Social Media Detox\u201d, a shortcut designed to help you reduce excessive social media use and make your time more productive and meaningful.</p>\n<p><strong>How it Works:</strong></p>\n<p>\"Social Media Detox\" works with the automation feature of the Shortcuts app to activate every time you open a chosen social media app. Whenever triggered, the shortcut displays a full-screen Quick Look window that temporarily obscures the social media app, encouraging you to take a 10-second pause to read a thoughtful message. This message is intended to motivate you to use your time more constructively. You can dismiss the Quick Look window by tapping \"done.\"</p>\n<p><strong>After that, the shortcut\u2019s behavior adjusts accordingly to the time of the day:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>From 7:30 AM to 10:30 PM (with an optional break from 5:30 PM to 10:30 PM):</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>When you open a social media app during these hours, the shortcut suggests alternative, more meaningful activities. Suggestions include working out, meditating, learning something helpful, or enjoying the fresh air outside. If you choose one of these activities, the social media app closes, and a motivational quote related to your selected activity is displayed.</p>\n<p>There are two unique activity options:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\"Another meaningful activity\": This simply closes the app and presents a general motivational message.</li>\n<li>\"I still want to use social media for an important reason\": This option allows you to specify the duration of your social media use with preset time intervals, such as 10 minutes, 30 minutes, 2 hours, 4 hours, etc. You can also manually enter a custom time. The shortcut will not interrupt your social media use during the specified period. If you decide to stop using the app, select \"I have changed my mind. I want to close the app now.\"</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You also have the choice to set a daily break period from 5:30 PM to 10:30 PM, during which the \"Social Media Detox\" shortcut will not activate, allowing you to enjoy social media without interruption.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>After 10:30 PM:</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The shortcut's approach changes, no longer suggesting alternative activities but instead encouraging you to rest. Your options are limited to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Using social media for 10 minutes</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Using social media for 30 minutes.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>**The shortcut will not retrigger during the specified time</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>\"I want to sleep\": Selecting this closes the app, promoting a healthier sleep routine.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>From 12:00 AM to 4:00 AM (Important Sleep Period):</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>During these late-night hours, \"Social Limit\" strongly discourages social media use. Each attempt to access a social media app will prompt you to shut it down. If you choose to continue, the alert will reappear upon reopening or switching back to the app. The only way to disable this persistent reminder is by turning off the shortcut's automation.</p>\n<p>\u2014&gt; In short, \"Social Media Detox\" is a tool aimed at supporting you in achieving a healthier digital lifestyle by providing structured and thoughtful prompts to help you consciously reduce your social media time to live a more meaningful life.</p>\n<p><strong>II. HOW TO USE</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Short Version for Experienced Users:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add the \"Social Media Detox\" shortcut.</li>\n<li>During the initial setup promt, choose whether to enable the off-work break (5:30 PM - 10:30 PM) by entering <code>0</code> for no or <code>1</code> for yes.</li>\n<li>Set up an Automation in the Shortcuts app to run the shortcut \"Social Media Detox\" immediately upon opening the chosen social media apps.</li>\n<li>To toggle the off-work break on or off later, edit the second text box within in the shortcut\u2019s editing interface</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Detailed Guide for New Shortcuts Users:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Install &amp; set up the shortcut</strong></p>\n<p>1) Add the shortcut to the Shortcuts app on your iPhone.</p>\n<p>2) Upon adding, a prompt will appear asking you to set up the shortcut.

With my current setup, Siri acts as my personal assistant, providing reminders for everything from a morning greeting to exercise, cleaning, meditation, and more, as the day progresses. This is all without me having to fo anything. This system has simplified my life, and I\u2019m excited to share my experience.</p>\n<p>What am I talking about? Upon waking, Siri greets me good morning, and shortly after, prompts me to meditate, even launching my meditation app. Following meditation, Siri suggests a shower, and then, reminds me to enjoy a 30-minute cleaning session, specifying the areas to clean that day. Before work begins, Siri alerts me 15 minutes in advance. At noon, Siri tells me it\u2019s time to break my fast, all orchestrated seamlessly by what feels like an autonomous smartphone assistant.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how I implemented this system: I first outlined my desired daily schedule on ChatGPT, focusing on becoming more productive, organized, and allocating time for exercise, cleaning, and relaxation. After refining this plan, I recognized the importance of having a timetable for routine tasks. I then created silent alarms in the Clock app for each voice reminder I wanted from Siri, labeling them for easy identification and setting them for specific days.</p>\n<p>For the voice reminders, I crafted speak text prompts in Shortcuts, tailoring Siri\u2019s announcements to my liking. Here are a few examples of the prompts I\u2019ve used:</p>\n<pre><code>\u2022   \u201cThe current time is 4:15. You have your daily walk in 30 minutes. Please change into your fitness clothing.\u201d\n\u2022   \u201cI hope you\u2019re feeling warm and relaxed after your shower because it\u2019s now time for your evening meditation. Remember, good sleep is as crucial as physical and mental health. Enjoy your meditation and sweet dreams.\u201d\n\u2022   \u201cHappy Hump Day. Let\u2019s make your bed, clean the entryway, start some laundry, and declutter as needed.\u201d\n</code></pre>\n<p>After creating these speak text commands, I customized the voice, pitch, and speed, and saved them. Then, I set up automations triggered by the silent alarms, attaching the corresponding speak text shortcuts to ensure that when the silent alarm goes off, Siri recites the prepared phrase.</p>\n<p>I chose alarms with no sound selection over calendar events for their user-friendly interface in selecting repetition options. This flexibility allows me to assign different cleaning tasks to specific days by linking them to the day\u2019s alarm. In the clock app you choose specific days of the week for your alarms too. This is great for tasks I only want occurring on the weekday versus weekend or weekly tasks.</p>\n<p>This approach helps immensely with my busy schedule, combating mental exhaustion by removing the burden of schedule management and task planning. I work full time, attend two classes, and work with a fitness coach, among other commitments. Living alone and working from home, this system suits me perfectly, though I recognize it may not be for everyone.</p>\n<p>For some tasks, I have Siri provide double prompts\u2014one 15 minutes before the task begins and another at the start time, allowing for creativity in managing my day.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019ve never done this please give it a go and tell me what you think about it. To me this makes my life feel very futuristic and I don\u2019t have to do anything with my phone after the initial set up. I hope this helps someone out if they are also dealing with a busy schedule or just feeling like life is pretty exhausting right now and just need a little help managing it all.</p>\n<p>Thanks for stopping by \u263a\ufe0f.</p>",
