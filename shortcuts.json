The idea is a crude AI that \u201elearns\u201c how to not loose all the time</p>\n<p>https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/6099d39acd3b40e59a93232abfeb87d6</p>\n<p>This is just a proof of concept.\nI\u2018m aware that I have bitten off way too much than I could chew. So far I have programmed 2 out of over 300 \u201ematchboxes\u201c and I\u2018m already losing control. Anyway, here is the principle:</p>\n<p>There is an amount of \u201etokens\u201c in a box. You take one at random and the token represents one move Menace can do on the grid.</p>\n<p>Move1 aka \u201eToken1\u201c aka \u201e1\u201c\n\ud83d\udfe5\u2b1c\ufe0f\u2b1c\ufe0f\n\u2b1c\ufe0f\u2b1c\ufe0f\u2b1c\ufe0f\n\u2b1c\ufe0f\u2b1c\ufe0f\u2b1c\ufe0f</p>\n<p>Move2 aka \u201eToken2\u201c aka \u201e2\u201c\n\u2b1c\ufe0f\ud83d\udfe5\u2b1c\ufe0f\n\u2b1c\ufe0f\u2b1c\ufe0f\u2b1c\ufe0f\n\u2b1c\ufe0f\u2b1c\ufe0f\u2b1c\ufe0f</p>\n<p>Move3 aka \u201eToken3\u201c aka \u201e3\u201c\n\u2b1c\ufe0f\u2b1c\ufe0f\u2b1c\ufe0f\n\u2b1c\ufe0f\ud83d\udfe5\u2b1c\ufe0f\n\u2b1c\ufe0f\u2b1c\ufe0f\u2b1c\ufe0f</p>\n<p>Because of symmetry, those are all possible starting-moves Menace can do.\n(Sure it\u2018s a simplification But I want to stay sane\ud83d\ude05)</p>\n<p>This is the idea:\nOnce a game is done Menace gets rewarded or punished.\nIf he has won or drawn a game he gets 3 additional tokens in the Box for each move he did to reach that win/draw. This will increase the probability to choose the \u201ewinning-move\u201c again.\nIf he loses a game one of the tokens used to lose that game gets removed. This will decrease the probability of him choosing that move again.</p>\n<p>Sure I can just randomize a number between 1-3 but there is no way of adjusting the probability for each token.\nI can do a list with\n1\n2\n3\nAnd pull randomly from that. Again this is hard to adjust. </p>\n<p>My approach is a little more complex as you will see.\nBasically I have a variable that defines how many tokes go into the box.\nSo I repeatably grab a token (text with \u201e1\u201c) and stich them to a bigger list.\nRepeat that for all 3 tokens and stitch all the stitched texts together again.  Now I can split them up again and can pull a random number.</p>\n<p>My idea is to put this structure in another 200x repeat and after each run, adjust the variable that defines how many 1s, 2s or 3s get stitched together for the new box.\nOr how many 1s, 2s... until 7s for the second box. And so on...</p>\n<p>I didn\u2018t went that far into all options.\nIf Menace starts with the corner-move, you have to respond with the first option (111) to see his second move.\nIf he chooses center or middle of the top row you have to restart. (Sorry)\nI didn\u2018t go further because I don\u2018t know if I\u2018m on the right path.\nSo my question is: \nAm I on the right path or am I making it too complicated? \nIs this even possible within shortcuts?</p>\n<p>Another issue I have is displaying the players move.\nChoosing from a list only shows the first row but as you see the pattern, it is 3 lines deep to make up the TicTacToe-grid.\nIs there a way to show them on top of each other? Currently it\u2018s like that:\n\ud83d\udfe6\u2b1c\ufe0f\u2b1c\ufe0f \u2b1c\ufe0f\u2b1c\ufe0f\u2b1c\ufe0f \u2b1c\ufe0f\u2b1c\ufe0f\u2b1c\ufe0f\nI can stitch them together afterwards that\u2018s not the issue but I don\u2018t like how it looks so far.</p>\n<p>The final shortcut would be some random games against Menace(without learning)\nThen let him learn for 200 runs with a randomized opponent and then again some games against the improved Menace. Every run should be logged because that\u2018s the interesting part. It is well known how it will end up. So it\u2018s not about programming the perfect TicTacToe-bot but rather let him develop the intelligence by itself. </p>\n<p>I know it is very useless and can be done much easier with python (I heard). </p>\n<p>Credits to Donald Michie</p>\n<p>And also Matt Parker (Youtube)\nKind regards!</p></div>",
