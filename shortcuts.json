If there\u2019s no direct way to hand it off, are there any ways to make this process easier? Right now I\u2018ve been turning Bluetooth off on my phone or computer and then it allows me to connect on my computer. It\u2019s not that much of a hassle but sometimes later I forget that Bluetooth is off and it becomes an issue later. I\u2019ve tried the \u201cSet Playback Destination\u201d and \u201cHand Off Playback\u201d and neither of them seem to want to recognize my computer as a destination. Sorry if this is a trivial question.</p></div>",
