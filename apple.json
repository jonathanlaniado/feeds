It is far from what Apple used to be like. The final version of software has so major bugs that I am astonished at how even they released it. The first and major one is notifications, they literally overlap one another. You can see a part of notification from an app and can\u2019t interact with it cause it\u2019s literally half overlapped with other app\u2019s notification. Mind you I am on iOS 15.0.2 and on my iPad on iPadOS 15.0.2. </p>\n<p>Now another major bug is COPYING a file in Flies App. I use an iPhone 12 Pro Max and a 9.7 inch iPad Pro. On both of these when I copy something of a large file. The Files App will crash and refuse to even open until I restart my phone. Even the Keyboard is laggy at times, it has click delays. Meaning the duration between I tap a letter and it getting registered is significantly noticeable and slow. </p>\n<p>Now Apple is even hiding that when it has been reported zero-day or zero-click bugs and also not crediting the bug finder.</p>\n<p>Overall I feel like Apple is not what it used to be. I personally feel like, Apple is not fixing things at all rather they are just trying to push weird updates and new features and leaving them buggy as well and then moving on to building another new feature. </p>\n<p>Please leave your views and opinions in the comments.</p></div>",

It's long for my own sake because I need to tell the story. There are pictures and videos of the events, but if you don't want to follow along, the gist is that I had my car stolen. The police weren't really optimistic about getting it back. But I'd put an AirTag in it in case it was stolen, and I was able to track that and, getting extremely lucky, find my car even though the AirTag had been found and ditched.)</em></p>\n<p>I am a night owl. I went out to get in my car around 3am earlier this week to find my car gone. I'm separated but still friends with my wife, and her younger brother lives with me. He's also a night owl, so I thought he'd taken the car to McDonald's or something. I texted him to see if that was the case, and he told me that no, he had not.</p>\n<p>My car (a 2010 Subaru Forester) had been stolen.</p>\n<p>I did all the normal stuff one should do when your car's stolen. I called the police and filed a report. They reported the car stolen but didn't seem optimistic much could be done. Which makes sense, I live in the Chicago suburbs, where there are millions of cars and the police are busy. I start an insurance claim and, very annoyed, just kind of sit down to wallow in pity and frustration with myself and whoever stole my dang car.</p>\n<p>I remembered then, after the dust settled, that I had put a spare AirTag in the sunglasses holder of my car. I'd bought a 4 pack and figured there might be an off chance it could potentially help me find the car. There's millions of iPhones in Chicagoland too, so I figured the chances of it getting pinged were decently high.</p>\n<p>So I marked the AirTag lost. It\u2019s last showed its location as my house at 10:17pm the night before, so I knew my car had been stolen in the previous 5 hours.</p>\n<p>Less than 10 minutes later, I got a <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/qpoAUYm\">notification that my car had been found</a> in Northlake, a Chicago suburb about a half hour from me. It was sitting in a <a href=\"https://imgur.com/RSQWzCD\">Walmart parking lot.</a> </p>\n<p>Obviously I immediately called 911 again and explained the situation. Police went to check the parking lot but couldn't find the car. </p>\n<p>I kept getting pings from the tracker in this Walmart parking lot, however. I figured that the thief had found and tossed the tracker. I was amped up and around 5:00am decided to head over and check the lot for myself. I expected maybe to find the tracker dumped in the lot and, possibly, use it to convince the police to take a look at the Walmart cameras, which they hadn't wanted to do before. </p>\n<p>As I drove to the Walmart, tense and still amped, I got several more pings from the tracker. I knew where it was, exactly. </p>\n<p>When I arrived at the parking lot, I drove around with my phone out the window until my bluetooth connected to the tracker. I parked and walked around until I found the tracker by ringing it. It was under a parked car, and I could hear it, but it was rainy and gross out and I didn't want to lay down in the puddle under the car to get it. So I sat and waited, hoping the car belonged to a customer who would leave. </p>\n<p>After a half hour or so I got bored of waiting and just decided to go home, defeated, and hope insurance would go smoothly. I thought I'd still call the investigating officer and tell him I knew the car had been in the parking lot and see if he'd pull Walmart's security footage. Maybe it would show someone known to them. Who knew.</p>\n<p>I sat at the light to leave the Walmart parking lot.</p>\n<p>Then I see MY STOLEN CAR TURN RIGHT PAST ME INTO THE PARKING LOT. This can be seen on <a href=\"https://youtu.be/4Tkj_o88plY\">dash cam footage</a> from my second car, where you can also see me over-excitedly calling the cops. </p>\n<p>If I'd have left 30 seconds earlier, I wouldn't have my car back. It was that close. </p>\n<p>I couldn't't believe it. I didn't see the plate, but my car is this unusual ugly orange color and I am 90% sure it's mine. I wait for the car to disappear around a corner in my rear view mirror and flip around. I watch this guy in my car drive slowly around and find an inconspicuous place to park. He backs in so the plate is hidden. Why he came back, I don\u2019t know. But I\u2019m glad he did.</p>\n<p>At this point I'm determined not to lose my car, having found it semi-miraculously. I'm tempted to drive right up and block him into his spot. But I don't want to get shot, and I don't want to damage my cars if he tries to ram his way out. So, kind of freaking out, I call the police again. This is the fourth time I've called 911 in the previous 3 hours, and the Northlake policewoman I'm transferred to knows the situation. </p>\n<p>Luckily, in very short order 2 police cars arrive. I wave and point frantically out my window at my car until they see it, and <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/YoiQngi\">they pull up on it.</a></p>\n<p>They pull a skinny pale kid from the car, so thin and dejected I genuinely slightly felt sorry for him. I felt even worse after learning he's homeless and, judging from the hard drug paraphernalia in my car, and addict. </p>\n<p><em>(As a personal aside, I\u2019ve had an easy life, and from what the officers told me, this kid has not. Still, he\u2019s wanted on several warrants and I have the choice between pressing. felony and misdemeanor charges. I am very staunchly opposed to our way of criminal justice here, so I decided press the lesser charges. I don\u2019t know if it will do any good, but at the hearing I intend to request some sort of drug treatment diversion program and hopefully have an opportunity to assure the kid I forgive him and wish him well. It probably won\u2019t do any good, but I think having one more person telling him how awful he is will probably do worse.)</em></p>\n<p>My car was trashed. It smelled like cigarettes and weed, and there were cigarette butts put out in my floorboard. In less than 7 hours my car now looked like a hoarder's car, I'm not exaggerating. The police had me go though all this stuff piece by piece myself to find what was mine and what wasn't. There are several bags of stolen phones, tablets, watches, and just a metric ton of junk. </p>\n<p>I got it detailed later that day. It just felt too gross to be in it before that.</p>\n<p>There are more and more developments to that story. Finding a key fob to what turns out to be <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/YMri5x4\">another stolen car</a> that's parked near my house later on, having been ditched by the thief before he stole my car. And having a detective interview me and a crime scene tech take my DNA to rule me out (I moved the car out of the way of a neighbors garage). Finding a bunch of neighbors' stuff in my car and learning that many other cars in our alley where we park were broken into. </p>\n<p>In fact, this guy, in the middle of robbing this whole line of cars, sat down in my second car (after stealing my BIL\u2019s cash from his wallet) and smoked 2 whole cigarettes in it, putting one out on my passenger seat.</p>\n<p>And more. </p>\n<p>It was just a crazy experience.</p>\n<p>But about the AirTags.</p>\n<p>They work to track down your car. I wouldn't have found mine without it. But I would have potentially found it faster if I'd hidden it better. So my advice: hide it well, but somewhere it will not be blocked from transmitting a Bluetooth signal. </p>\n<p>All in all, I just want to vouch for the fact that these things work decently for the price and purpose. I wouldn\u2019t count on them 100% but I\u2019d also still recommend using them for this purpose if you don\u2019t feel like paying for a GPS module.</p>\n<p>OH, and for God's sake people. Don't be an idiot like me. Lock your damn car, and don't keep your keys in it. I'd gotten complacent living somewhere off the beaten path in a safe suburb and parking my car off the street in a private slot. I fully admit to being stupid on that point, roast me all you want.</p></div>",

I hope your Sunday is as great as mine!</p>\n<p>I\u2019d love to tell you about a new iOS app that I developed over the summer and released recently: Noir. <strong>Noir is a Safari extension for iOS that automatically adds a dark mode to every website you visit.</strong></p>\n<p>Convinced already? You can download Noir here: https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1581140954</p>\n<p>Want some more info? I\u2019d love to tell you more about the app the brand new update that released just today!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Noir generates a custom dark mode for every website you visit. This means it\u2019ll look great and contrast and highlights will still come through.</li>\n<li>The extension and app are deeply integrated in iOS: by default Noir will only darken websites whenever your device\u2019s Dark Mode is turned on. The Noir app itself is a fully native app, and the extension interface has a native look. This means Noir feels right at home on iOS.</li>\n<li>Noir even supports the Shortcuts app to quickly enable or disable the extension. This makes it super easy to integrate Noir in your workflow or to schedule Noir to only be active during certain hours.</li>\n<li>Noir detects when a website already has a dark mode of its own, and if so, Noir will not darken the website again.</li>\n<li>There\u2019s a \u2018true black\u2019 mode which looks especially great on phones with an OLED screen.</li>\n<li>You can fully customize Noir per website, including whether you want Noir to run at all, the theme it uses, and more.</li>\n<li>Noir does not collect any browsing data. Period.</li>\n<li>Noir is a simple-one time purchase. There are no subscriptions, and no ads.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Since the initial release of Noir 3 weeks ago I\u2019ve been working hard to improve the app by adding new features and fixing issues that have been reported by users.</p>\n<p>And just today I\u2019ve released the second \u2018feature update\u2019 of Noir. With this updates I added the option to darken images. This makes web pages even darker. In my testing this is especially great on news sites. Additionally Noir now also has an optional \u2018gray\u2019 theme for darkening web pages, which makes the websites a bit lighter than pure black.</p>\n<p>If you ever browse the web at night (and let\u2019s be honest, who doesn\u2019t use their phone in bed sometimes?), Noir will make this experience really so much better.</p>\n<p>I hope you give Noir a try and I hope you\u2019ll enjoy the app. I\u2019d love to hear what you think! I\u2019ll be here to answer any question you might have.</p>\n<p>Download Noir here: https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1581140954</p></div>",
