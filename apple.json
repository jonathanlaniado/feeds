There are absolutely legitimate concerns around the potential for this system to be abused by oppressive regimes from around the world.</p>\n<p>This conversation needs to happen.  For me, the line from the letter congratulating Team Apple and telling them to ignore the \u201cscreeching voice of the minority\u201d was where Apple lost me in this battle until they can provide absolute guarantees that this CAN NEVER BE ABUSED\u2026 EVER.</p>\n<p>That line told me that there is no interest in having this conversation.  At all.  Organizations that will benefit from this have zero interest in ensuring privacy for everyone else, including those that could be political targets in certain regions of the world.</p>\n<p>The apparatus that Apple has built uses \u201cfor the children\u201d as an excuse to build the framework, but that framework can absolutely be adapted.  If anyone thinks that Apple wouldn\u2019t roll over if told \u201cyou will scan for these images in China or we won\u2019t allow you to sell here\u201d, remember this.  Apple boasted just a couple of years ago that \u201cwhat happens on your iPhone stays on your iPhone\u201d and this week seems to have amended that with, \u201cwell, except where we make exceptions.\u201d</p>\n<p>This won\u2019t be the end of intrusion.  I hate child exploitation as much as anyone, but I also hate the potential for governments to attack, for example, those with LBGT imagery or unpalatable political imagery\u201d on these same devices.</p>\n<p>Yes, TODAY, the database is CSAM, but tomorrow, it could be something else.  That is the danger here and why we need to push Apple to rethink this direction or make ironclad guarantees that the worst CAN\u2019T happen, but I don\u2019t think the latter is possible.</p></div>",

Same with the iPhone 13 Pro. I\u2019ve spent close to $30k on Apple products in my lifetime.</p>\n<p>Today I\u2019m spending $4k+ on a custom built PC and it\u2019s going to be a huge pain to transition to PC, learn windows or Linux, etc. but I feel that I must.</p>\n<p>Apple tricked us into believing that their platform is safe, private, and secure. Privacy is a huge issue for me; as a victim of CP, I believe very strongly in fighting CP \u2014 but this is just not the way. </p>\n<p>I\u2019ve worked in software and there will be so many false positives. There always are. </p>\n<p>So I\u2019m done. I\u2019m not paying a premium price for iCloud &amp; Apple devices just to be spied on. </p>\n<p>I don\u2019t care how it works, every system is eventually flawed and encryption only works until it\u2019s decrypted. </p>\n<p>Best of luck to you, Apple. I hope you change your mind. This is invasive. This isn\u2019t ok.</p>\n<p>Edit: You all are welcome to hate on me, call me reactive, tell me it\u2019s a poorly thought out decision. You\u2019re welcome to call me stupid or a moron, but please leave me alone when it comes to calling me a liar because I said I\u2019m a CP victim. I\u2019ve had a lot of therapy for c-ptsd, but being told that I\u2019m making it up hurts me in a way that I can\u2019t even convey. Please just\u2026 leave it alone.</p></div>",

Whoever has that picture on their phone will be detected and reported (if they forget to turn off iCloud which is on by default). This gives government even more powerful tools than having access to all your iCloud photos, because they will be alerted if there\u2019s a match. Normally I don\u2019t think government will look into all citizens\u2019 photo</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This technology can extend to audio files or documents on your phone. Apple can say they don\u2019t read or hear the document, just generate a hash signature of them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Apple said it can only see photos if it passes a certain matching threshold but this threshold is controlled solely by Apple. If it decides to lower the threshold to zero, all photos will become visible to them. This is a backdoor to bypass encryption and will surely be exploited.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Hashes of known illegal images are stored on devices. So it a device get hacked or jailbroken, someone can technically modify this list.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ambiguity of jurisdiction: if this is applicable to the U.S., then who are subject to this law? Is it based on the device serial number (sold in US market), or based on iCloud details registration, or location of the phone, or user nationality? If a Russian visits the U.S. with a matching photo, will he be reported? This can create a lot of confusion</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Most importantly, this creates a precedence. Knowing Apple can do this, government will surely ask for more. </p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Please share your thoughts or let me know if my understanding is incorrect</p></div>",

By a razer thin margin of 119 to 121 at the time of closing (4PM EST), decision has been made to open the floodgates.

So where are the limits?</p>\n<p>What\u2019s to stop Apple from implementing \u201cprivate and secure\u201d measures in HomeKit, for the greater good? </p>\n<p>Will they develop ML algorithms to monitor all HomeKit camera feeds for any, potentially criminal, activity? These algorithms could have a very high threshold of security, only flagging your recordings if they reach a certain threshold of likely criminality. Then an Apple employee could review the footage personally, before sending it to authorities. </p>\n<p>If you\u2019re not doing anything wrong, there\u2019s nothing to worry about, right? </p>\n<p>What about smart door locks? Why shouldn\u2019t Apple develop a program to grant law enforcement agencies digital keys to people\u2019s homes, in certain situations? Maybe you fall and your Apple Watch calls emergency services, who can get in your house, without having to break your door down. There\u2019s no harm in that, right? </p>\n<p>Once encryption, along with measures to protect user privacy and security, are subject to whatever moral principles Apple has decided are more important \u2014 suddenly these protections mean nothing. They\u2019re a secure vault from the front, but the back is nothing more than cardboard, held on with office tape.</p>\n<p>Edit: It just occurred to me that in the exact same update that\u2019s going to introduce this  new, on device, CSAM hash comparison, for iCloud users \u2014 Apple is also introducing unlimited HomeKit security camera storage, for paid iCloud subscribers.</p></div>",

The app is on iPhone, iPad and WatchOS (with MacOS coming soon). It handles syncing and storing data all through your iCloud account.</p>\n<p>The app lets you create repeatable checklists. It's great for packing lists, daily routines, cleaning lists and things that you need to take with you constantly. The reason it is different to apps like Apple reminders is once you complete a checklist you can uncheck every item so it is ready to go next time.</p>\n<p>I built the app because I found myself forgetting things more and more after the birth of my son. For example, dropping him at daycare and then going to the gym, required so many things. I felt overwhelmed and would take ages to leave the house as I searched around looking for what I needed. I wanted a solution, I built this app to help.</p>\n<p>I'm constantly iterating the app, I am currently working on the ability to keep a history of checklists you have completed so you can check you did things (like taking medication every morning). If anyone has any ideas for features they would like to see let me know :)</p>\n<p>You can find more information on the app and follow its development here: <a href=\"https://checkyourlist.app/\">https://checkyourlist.app/</a></p>\n<p>You can see the app in the app store here: <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/au/app/checkyourlist/id1571623264\">https://apps.apple.com/au/app/checkyourlist/id1571623264</a></p></div>",

            "content_html": "<p>Hi everyone, I\u2019ve seen a lot of questions online lately from people about their iPhone\u2019s battery health and whether their batteries are wearing unusually fast. iPhone 12 owners are asking things like \u201cI\u2019ve only had my phone for 10 months and battery health is already down to 90%, is that normal or do I have a defective battery?\u201d</p>\n<p>Apple has two main support pages about this listed here:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208387\">https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208387</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208387\">https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208387</a></p>\n<p>Specifically, unlike Mac, iPad, and Apple Watch batteries that are rated to 1000 cycles, the iPhone\u2019s battery is \u201cdesigned to retain up to 80% of its original capacity at 500 complete charge cycles when operating under normal conditions.\u201d</p>\n<p>That means that if wear happens relatively linearly, you should expect to be down to 90% health after 250 cycles. Assuming you cycle your battery about once a day, then a brand new iPhone 12 bought at launch should, according to Apple\u2019s typical expectations, be worn down \\~10% already, as it has been 277 days since iPhone 12\u2019s launch day.</p>\n<p>Of course, it is frustrating that because of this, your phone has an expected 1.5 year lifespan before possibly needing a battery service on a battery that is not easily replaced.</p>\n<p>The batteries can wear more quickly due to more frequent charge cycles, and especially due to heat. They also wear more rapidly when they\u2019re more frequently pushed to 100% charge. So some suggestions for prolonging battery life include:</p>\n<p>- Avoid wireless charging as it does generate additional heat (this does go against using MagSafe, but it could over time save you a few health percentage points).</p>\n<p>- Try to avoid getting your phone too hot with regular use.</p>\n<p>- Use the features that prevent charging past 80% until the morning, and also always try to keep your battery level above 20%.</p>\n<p>But ultimately the point is, I think we\u2019re used to built in batteries having a longer cycle rating than modern iPhones seem to have. It\u2019s unfortunate, and I don\u2019t know why the iPhone batteries rate worse than other products, but the answer to the question of \u201cis 90% expected at this time\u201d appears, from Apple\u2019s perspective, to be yes.</p>",

            "title": "Longtime android user switched to apple, my thoughts",
            "content_html": "<p>I am a long time Android user, I'm used to the Android environment and can navigate the OS and system like the back of my hand. I had the Galaxy S2 when it came out and since then have used several Samsung and Android phones. Not so reputable brands and also flagship brands. I used the S6, S7, S8, and up to recently, S10+. I've never used an Apple phone and my experience with iOS is using a macbook like 2 times a decade ago.</p>\n<p>I always found with every Samsung phone I had, they get slower after a year. Noticeably. The build quality on the Galaxy phones are very high quality, but also very fragile. My S6 took one waist high drop face down and the screen was shattered. S7, one drop from chair sitting height onto the concrete destroyed the screen. S8, I had my keys and phone in the same pocket, bent over once to pick up some boxes at work, screen broke completely and was non-functional. The point is they're fragile designs. The double edged glass did not help. My last Android phone, S10+ faired a lot better. Left it on top of my car and drove off with it, and found it in a bush a few days later via find my phone. It looked like someone magdumped into the screen at point blank then ran it over, but the phone was still functional, albiet the back camera.</p>\n<p>So it was time for me to upgrade, the cracked screen was getting worse overtime and the grooves in the glass were beginning to feel sharp and cut me. I decided, because most of my family switched to Apple, I would try out the Apple ecosystem and devices. On a whim, I went and upgraded to an Iphone 12 pro. I was pretty clumsy at first with the different gesture and menu system, but found after looking through every setting that its very easy and much more simple than Android and I got used to the main gestures fast. The extent of my customization on Android wasn't enough that I relied on every customization feature of Android, so switching over to iOS, the lack of certain customizable features wasn't really a loss for me.</p>\n<p>Installing apps is different, its much more regulated and closed off, but I respect that because its higher security. The face ID system is black magic. I really like it. Its so much more convienient than Android, its reliable and its snappy. It does literally what its supposed to do. I don't have to press much buttons or type in a passcode and I liek that convenience.</p>\n<p>Really overall, I don't know what it is, but the build of the phone, the snappiness of the software and the speed of the hardware is faster and I think better compared to Android. When I hold an Android phone, I know I'm holding a piece of pretty advanced and fast tech. With an Apple phone, its like I'm holding a piece of fine china, which also happens to be fast tech as well. Its weightier and feels snappy and instant. To be honest, I don't really need a wide array of customization features, I'm happy with what's provided with currently.</p>\n<p>Now, my only critique is software based. I think the method of adding pictures and music is convoluted personally. I much prefer dragging and dropping my files into a filesystem, which Apple does not have. What Apple is good at however is organizing everything into their respective lane though. It feels cleaner.</p>\n<p>One thing I noticed throughout all of my Android phones which is a constant, is the fragility. My friend who has an Iphone 10, dropped it more than I can count on my hand on the concrete, hardwood floor, he dipped it into a lake, and it even powerslid across the floor at one point after dropping. His screen wasn't cracked at all. It showed me literal evidence that the iphone seems more rugged.</p>\n<p>Overall, I do not regret my switch. I have still a bit of learning of the ins and outs, but I got most of the gestures and navigation and OS down. Its a quality product.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>There's been a lot of rumours that a new 16\" and first-ever 14\" MacBook Pro will be released in the third or fourth quarter of the year [<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/14-inch-macbook-pro/\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/news/macbook-pro-14-inch-2021-release-date-price-news-and-leaks\">2</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.co.uk/news/14-inch-macbook-pro-3787300/\">3</a>, <a href=\"https://appleinsider.com/inside/14-inch-macbook-pro\">4</a>, <a href=\"https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-macbook-pro-2021-release-date-price-specs-and-design-4112058\">5</a>].</p>\n<p>Apart from the rumoured 1080p webcam, the return of HDMI and other ports and a new design, one feature seems especially interesting - the new M1X chip. Especially the fact that the new chip will supposedly have either 16 or 32 GPU cores compared to the current 8 cores in the M1 chip.</p>\n<p>The current M1 GPU is often compared to an Nvidia GTX 1650 (Mobile) in terms of performance. Based on the fact that the new M1X GPU will have either 2x or 4x the cores of the M1 GPU, I assume that we can expect it to be either 2x or 4x faster.</p>\n<p>If it would be 2x faster, that would make it equivalent to an Nvidia RTX 3060 (Mobile). However, the 32-core version assumed to be 4x faster than the current 8-core GPU would be equivalent to an RTX 3070-Ti (Desktop) while being 30% faster than RTX 3080 (Mobile). I picked the equivalents based on the data from UserBenchmark [<a href=\"https://gpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Nvidia-GTX-1650-Mobile-vs-Nvidia-RTX-3060-Laptop/m775280vsm1452971\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://gpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Nvidia-GTX-1650-Mobile-vs-Nvidia-RTX-3070-Ti/m775280vs4116\">2</a>, <a href=\"https://gpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Nvidia-RTX-3080-Laptop-vs-Nvidia-RTX-3070-Ti/m1443565vs4116\">3</a>].</p>\n<p>Do you think it's possible for the upcoming M1X integrated GPU to be comparable in performance to current high-end dedicated GPUs?</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>Hi,</p>\n<p>Knowing that batteries degrade when kept too long at 80%+, I was wondering why Apple does not permit its users to manually set optimized charging. I guess a manual setting (like an alarm) would be the best solution to make this work most efficiently.</p>\n<p>Also, I would be glad if I could manually limit the charging to a certain battery percentage, without having to manually unplug the device once it reaches a certain percentage. This would also improve the battery health of the phones in the long term.</p>\n<p>I think there is no reason to not implement this kind of features (people who don't know what they are doing won't touch such feature anyways, I think).</p>\n<p>What do you guys think?</p>",

I've used other mainstream headphones, such as Beats, Sony, Bose, JBL, etc. (although I have not tried newer ones from the last 2 years),  and none have come close to that wonderful noise-cancellation and noise-transparency that the Airpods Max have. But the price tag scared me... </p>\n<p>I am not an adult that is financially responsible with a steady salary, just a college kid, so you can understand why the price tag bums me out. But I worked hard this summer and I think I deserve something nice.</p>\n<p>I have read that if your not deep in the Apple Ecosystem then is no-go. I wouldn't say I am deep but I am not out of it also. My main tool is my iPad, I use it for everything music (I use Apple Music), college, writing, entertainment, and pretty much everything. But I do not have an iPhone.</p>\n<p>Finally, I do not want Airpods/Airpods Pro (really any of these pods,buds) because they damage my ear, I have always preferred over/on-the-ear headphones because of this.</p>\n<p>I have seen many YouTube videos, but I would like an advice given my \"story\" (if you can call it that).</p>\n<p>So what would your advice be?</p>\n<p>For now I am thinking of waiting till Black Friday or Cyber Monday (and have seen price drops on Amazon).</p>",

            "title": "Why do Apple's media services apps suck so bad?",
            "content_html": "<p>Compared to the other Apple's native apps (Safari, Reminders, Notes, iMessage etc) their media services apps are generally slow, clunky and have bad UX/UI. Here is why:</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><strong>Apple Music:</strong> Everything feels zoomed in 150% with thumbnails so big it's hard to navigate. The app is slow and drops frames like crazy on older iPhones. It's filled with bugs like the recent one where the dolby atmos/lossless songs were stopping at 15 seconds, and it took them 1+ month to fix it (with iOS 14.7 which isn't out yet). It takes 5 seconds to load on app launch and when you click on a playlist/album the tracks take another 2-3 seconds to show the songs. The love/add to playlist buttons is hidden within the ... button. The shuffle/repeat buttons are hidden within the queue. It has a redundant volume slider which we have hardware buttons for that. The player swipe up animation is clunky, it doesn't follow your finger and it doesn't swipe up until your finger is half way through the screen. But it swipes down just fine. If you're making a short swipe left-right on the playlists it refuses to swipe and stutters back to the same position, you need a bigger finger swipe for it to actually move. Search is slow. You can't make folders and sort Apple's curated playlists. </p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><strong>Apple Podcasts:</strong> Everything feels zoomed in 150% with thumbnails so big it's hard to navigate. The player swipe up animation is clunky, it doesn't follow your finger and it doesn't swipe up until your finger is half way through the screen. But it swipes down just fine. New episodes sometimes don't show up until much later. Episodes shownotes don't support basic html tags. On a podcast page the follow button is a small \"+\" all the way up which is hard to tap and it takes a good 2-3 seconds to respond with a huge popup which takes half of your screen, while the main center button is \"play latest episode\". Even if you dig into the app settings and tick the option to not download every episode from podcasts you follow, it downloads them anyway.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><strong>Apple TV+:</strong> The app feels much smoother than Music &amp; Podcats and thank god they added a dedicated TV+ tab. The Movies/TV Shows you add to your list and the \"continue watching\" are mixed into a \"Up Next\" category which isn't on the TV+ tab, they should also be separated. The player sometimes doesn't show the \"Skip Intro\" button and sometimes randomly when the episode ends it doesn't start the next episode automatically which gives the impression that the TV Show ended there. The whole thing with adding hundreds of other streaming services in there and even dedicated purchases feels too confusing, the TV+ should have a dedicated app. If you start watching a tv show and the next episode is next week, does it send a notification to remind you that the next episode is up?</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> I don't really get why these apps don't get the same love and attention compared to the other native apps. Especially considering these are paid subscriptions and the whole services strategy is how Apple wants to grow and keep making money now that people aren't upgrading their iPhones every 1-2 years. I want Apple to take my money, but I can't give it to them if their services are inferior to competition. Some of the issues are so dumb that I genuinely think the developer teams in charge of these apps don't actually use their services on a daily basis, they should be fired imo.</p>",

Needless to say, this machine is old. I've gone through 2 other MacBooks since getting this Mac Mini.</p>\n<p>Using this <em>8 year old</em> machine, I am impressed by how fast this machine still is and just how well it still works. I originally pulled it out of storage to erase the hard drive so that I can sell it, but I'm not so sure I actually want to sell it anymore - it probably won't have much resell value anyways. I might just sell my current 2016 15\" MacBook instead (least favorite Mac by far and don't need the portability). The only downer is that the 2012 Mac Mini can't do 4K. Maybe there's a nostalgia factor going on here, but does anyone else miss the Macs of yesteryear, when they were user-upgradeable?</p>\n<p>Edit: Just checked eBay. This Mac Mini is still going for almost $300 with similar specs.</p>",

While this is true, it's tedious and you have to remember all the command and parameters, plus it's easy to get wrong and not that many are tech-savvy or care enough to do. I used to keep a list of some commands I need often, but then I wish for a Mac app like Almighty so I can just click and save time to do some other important works</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>\ud83d\udcbb Available also on Mac AppStore</p>\n<p>I initially make Almighty as a standalone Mac app with payment by Paddle. Some have asked me to submit to AppStore as well, so did I. Due to some discussions with AppStore reviewers that I've reduced the numbers of tweaks for Mac version (for now, I will add more later) so you know that Almighty is available both as standalone and in Mac AppStore</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>\ud83d\udef0 What about Shortcut in Mac Monterey</p>\n<p>Every tweak in Almighty can be configured and assigned keyboard shortcut so you can execute faster and more convenient. You can also group in workflow and show your favorite workflow in menu bar too.</p>\n<p>I initially plan to have my own voice command system, but as you know from WWDC21 Mac Monterey has Shortcuts support, Almighty will then donate all of its tweaks to Shortcuts app so you can access them even easier.</p>\n<p>\ud83d\udd25 Thanks to many who joined beta and those provided feedback, I'm constantly adding more features and utilities to Almighty. Any suggestion is more than welcome.</p>\n<p>Hope you find the app useful, it has trial period with access to all tweaks with unlimited use so you can see if it provides some value to you. I often post updates at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/getalmighty\">https://twitter.com/getalmighty</a> and you can find more info at <a href=\"https://onmyway133.com/almighty/\">https://onmyway133.com/almighty/</a></p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Thanks a lot for checking and have a nice day &amp; stay safe \u2764\ufe0f</p>",

One of his colleagues recalls a visit there: \u201cI remember going into Steve\u2019s house and he had almost no furniture in it. He just had a picture of Einstein, whom he admired greatly, and he had a Tiffany lamp and a chair and a bed. He just didn\u2019t believe in having lots of things around but he was incredibly careful in what he selected.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Before I go getting all inspired, is this true?

            "title": "A Case for Touch ID in 2021",
            "content_html": "<p>It's 2021 but I'm still craning my neck, entering my passcode multiple times a day, staring at a notch, and the Apple Pay experience is worse than it used to be.  Check out my admittedly whiney reasons as to why Touch ID still has merit!</p>\n<p>TLDR - Face ID is superior for in phone usage like passwords, autofill, and app authentication, but for unlocking the phone and apple pay, Touch ID is superior.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The Long Neck</strong>.  The number one reason (personally) against Face ID and for Touch ID is when your phone is lying flat on a surface next to or in front of you and you want to use it without holding it.  I can't imagine I am the only person who has their phone in front of them on a desk or table and you want to wake and authenticate the phone without picking it up.  So, in order to do that, you tap the screen and then awkwardly hover over your phone and/or stick your neck out to get to the home screen and then continue to use your phone.  Touch ID, wake <em>and</em> authenticate with one move, awesome.  I miss that. \u00a0</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Rest Finger to Open.</strong> \u00a0This was such an underrated feature, as it meant that in the process of waking the phone (with either a click or raising) you were also authenticating to actually blow by the notification screen right to the home screen. \u00a0This may seem small, but this would allow you to wake and authenticate the phone straight from your pocket.  This also lines up with a ridiculous comment I see all the time against Touch ID - \"Touch ID was terrible because if you were wearing gloves or your finger was wet, it wouldn't work!\"  BUT... Face ID still requires the swipe up, can't have your finger wet or be wearing gloves for that either!  As a modern uptake of Rest Finger to Open, I've always argued that Face ID should have a similar <em>option</em>.  Wake &gt; Authenticate &gt; Home, no swiping.  Just blow by the notifications.  Just a personal preference there.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The Notch</strong>. \u00a0Let's be honest, we have dealt with it, we have gotten used to it, but it is unsightly.  This isn't a required problem of Face ID, Apple could just go straight across and never allow for the notch to interfere, but still, here we are.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Apple Pay</strong>. \u00a0This is nit picky but bear with me.  When Apple Pay was first rolling out, if you held your phone near the POS terminal, the phone would wake asking for authentication to pay, then you could just rest your finger on Touch ID and the transaction was done. \u00a0No need to shift your finger to the awkward double click of apple pay now which might very well trigger a screen shot as the ergonomics of the phone requires some workaround to avoid the volume buttons when squeezing the power button twice. \u00a0The wake screen still works when holding it near the POS terminal now, but then once woken, you have to double click and authenticate with face id which requires you to move the phone away from the terminal unless the terminal is somewhat near head level, which it never is. \u00a0So, the best way with Face ID, is to double click the power button prior to getting the phone near the terminal and authenticating, then putting the phone at the terminal to pay. \u00a0It is an awkward order of events compared to Touch ID which was just hold near terminal and rest finger on the touch id... that was it. \u00a0So nice. \u00a0Granted, I think the Apple Watch would be king of Apple Pay if it didn't require the double click but at least authentication isn't necessary since it is already on your wrist and unlocked. \u00a0But the best apple pay experience was easily Touch ID with the terminal waking the phone and authentication occurring while your finger was resting on Touch ID. \u00a0So seamless. \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Sun Glasses</strong>. \u00a0Polarized sun glasses don't work with Face ID if you have the setting on that requires attention (eyes open). \u00a0I like my sun glasses polarized as I hate glare and spend a decent bit of time on the water.  But I also like the stronger privacy setting of requiring attention.  Ugh.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Unintentional Wake and Lock</strong>. \u00a0What happens pretty often is I will wake my phone and be looking at it while it is on a flat surface just to look at a notification or even just the time. \u00a0Face ID attempts to authenticate because my head is somewhat in view but due to the off angle, the authentication fails. \u00a0I don't notice this because I am just looking at a notification, but what ends up happening is I do this several times in a row then Face ID shuts down and I have to enter my passcode when I finally end up wanting to go to my home screen. \u00a0The crazy thing is, this is what happened when Face ID was first debuted to the public at whichever Keynote it was introduced. \u00a0Other presenters had stood in front of the new Face ID phone and the phone tried to authenticate the wrong person enough times that when Federighi got up there, it required the passcode again after several \"failed\" attempts which were really just the phone trying to authenticate at the wrong time (just like when my phone is on a flat surface).  This last one happens several times daily to me and I find it insanely frustrating.  </p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>The best would be a combination of both, and I think most would agree.  Double up that security for unlocking with either both or one.  Unlocking with touch id I still think is superior but then for in phone usage such as passwords, apps, auto-fill, etc. Face ID is better.  </p>\n<p>Lastly, I understand there are varying levels of care for such a small thing when arguably my issues above are small and whiny, but we all unlock our iPhones probably 100s of times a day and the above mentioned processes can diminish the experience.  Just my two cents as to why Touch ID still has strong merits in 2021.</p>\n<p>Fire back your thoughts!</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>I'm generally prone to losing things, but I actually hadn't lost my wallet in a couple of years. I was overdue. I was on my way back from my first concert since the pandemic started, it ended in Bushwick around 4am and then I had to walk 30 minutes to the Metropolitan G (there weren't any Ubers out at that time). By then, I was barely alive, and my wallet must have slipped out of my pocket into the train sometime between 4:30-5:30am. Most of the time if you lose your wallet on the subway, your chances of getting it back are so slim you don't even try, but I had luck, a kind stranger, and airtags on my side.</p>\n<p>I got up the next day around 1pm, so quite some time had passed since the wallet slipped out. I wasn't actually aware until I was about to leave the apartment with my girlfriend (her name is Ashley) to go to a friend's BBQ. I pulled up the Find My app and saw that it was all the way at Church ave. Suspicions confirmed, Church ave is the last stop on the G. I was worried that the wallet was still on a moving subway and I\u2019d have to track it down en route, but I saw it was at Church ave 15 min ago, and 10 minute later there was another update that showed it was still there.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://willliu.com/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Fc75d6999-904c-4b7c-817b-bf2ec772c446%2FIMG_9551.png?table=block&amp;id=c0af4a3c-515f-4eec-86cc-ee80d77a1be6&amp;spaceId=d7c01436-0d32-43ee-b215-3b2e9c2492a6&amp;width=580&amp;userId=&amp;cache=v2\">A screenshot of the Find My app telling me my wallet was at the last stop on the G train</a></p>\n<p>We run out and get on the Church bound G right away. We get all the way to the station and immediately go to the booth. The lady at the booth says she hasn\u2019t gotten a wallet. We re-surface to try to get another reading, and see that it's closer to the entrance at the end of the block. We head over and down, but there\u2019s no booth at this side of the station. However, there were some cops nearby and a door that leads to some of the MTA employee spaces. I asked them if I could get in there to ask around, and luckily an MTA guy showed up right then and they brought me in. They took me into a staff breakroom and asked around. No one had seen the wallet, and precision find wasn\u2019t activating even though we were right where the app said it was. One of the guy tells me that it\u2019s probably down in the dispatchers office, which was right underneath us.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/66b04325-0ce4-4815-b111-aa5ea409be59/ezgif-3-aa4196d25407.gif?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45O3KS52Y5%2F20210719%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20210719T155330Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=86400&amp;X-Amz-Signature=ba9f4793895a7d3122814eaa21ca72da068bf84fc0c4ebef9789eaa95f9f92fe&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\">My girlfriend recorded me coming out of the MTA office with the cop and MTA guy lol</a></p>\n<p>We head down the stairs and precision find activates! It starts pointing us right to the booth. I\u2019m getting really excited at this point, I really needed my wallet because we were traveling at the end of the week. <a href=\"https://willliu.com/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Fa91b3942-3b24-4762-ad66-441b424e1b62%2F588FED4B-241F-4111-AB02-525CC49793D3_1_105_c.jpeg?table=block&amp;id=c282457b-85bf-472b-8e18-de2462666e0d&amp;spaceId=d7c01436-0d32-43ee-b215-3b2e9c2492a6&amp;width=2050&amp;userId=&amp;cache=v2\">We knock on the door and ask the lady inside about a wallet</a>. She says she hasn\u2019t seen or heard about no wallet and shrugs us off. She really didn't want to deal with us and she seemed pretty sure that a wallet did not get turned in.</p>\n<p>But we\u2019re SO close, I know the wallet is somewhere around so I keep pushing. I show her the arrow on my phone and tell her that the arrow would lead to the phone. She takes my phone, and goes back inside the office. We can see precision finding guiding her around the office, until it takes her to a drawer, which she opens. To her disbelief, my wallet is there!</p>\n<p>The best part about this was the surprise and excitement that lady had. She kept asking me, \u201cHow did you do that??\u201d \u201cWhat is that thing?\u201d. \u201cThat was so cool!!!\u201d. I was really happy to get it back of course, but seeing her in awe of this tech really made me feel proud to live that Apple ecosystem life.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://willliu.com/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F7ab259ad-d7bd-44f8-86fa-4c74216e0ee9%2F60908632-3212-4CB3-AE74-3946823F331F_1_105_c.jpeg?table=block&amp;id=ec25f3d1-f57d-40c0-9c11-483bd0f3390e&amp;spaceId=d7c01436-0d32-43ee-b215-3b2e9c2492a6&amp;width=2050&amp;userId=&amp;cache=v2\">Got my wallet back!</a></p>\n<p>I\u2019m so thankful I tagged my wallet, and really impressed with how the tech worked out for me in a real life situation. If I didn\u2019t have the tag, there\u2019s no way I would have gotten that wallet back. I could have wandered down to the dispatchers office, talked to the same lady, and definitely would not have gotten the wallet back even if I was 20 feet away from it. Lately, tech has been moving so fast that I have built in expectations around improvements. It's been some time since I've used some tech that has really wowed me and given me that holy-shit-this-is-the-future feeling. What's really impressive is how a simple and cheap device can tie into the existing ecosystem and integrate with the other devices to create a practical and powerful experience for users.</p>\n<p>This post is dedicated to the kind stranger who turned my wallet in without taking anything inside of it!</p>",

But I also love the idea of using Apple Music to stay in the \"Apple Ecosystem\", so I've tried the free trial to see what I thought. </p>\n<p>I know there are people on here that eco similar thoughts of the UI and overall usability of Apple Music lacking compared to Spotify, but I haven't seen anyone list out all the small things that make it hard to make the switch. There are obvious missing huge features like Spotify Connect. But there are so many small gripes I have with their desktop player that make it really hard for me to justify switching over:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Not clear what is album vs a playlist in AM. Spotify is better at making playlist artwork that stands apart</li>\n<li>AM is slow. Whenever a new page is loading it takes a good second to load the information on the page. I'm not sure why this is. </li>\n<li>Annoying to switch between mini player and big player in AM</li>\n<li>Cant click artist name or song name in mini player</li>\n<li>AM search results are lacking in depth and ease of navigation after something is searched.</li>\n<li>When AM is quit, and opened again, it does not remember what you were last listening to</li>\n<li>CMD + S does not enable shuffle</li>\n<li>Artists top songs do not show number of plays</li>\n<li>When an album has music videos at the end, it automatically plays them when the album reaches that point and plays them in full screen</li>\n<li>Cant find public playlists, only apple generated ones</li>\n<li>Clicking song name on a song in a playlist does not take you to the album</li>\n<li>Playlists you create don\u2019t have the artists name or album clickable, need to right click and \u201cshow on Apple Music\u201d</li>\n<li>Cant preview a stations songs by clicking on the album art, have to click play to start playing the station and get a list of songs</li>\n</ul>",
