Especially to the Z Flip or the Fold 3. Those being the gimmicky phones isn't the only reason I'm thinking about moving back, as there are some other software things that I prefer on Android.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Back Button:</strong> After a year, I still miss the back button on Android. I thought I would get over it, but I didn't. I was playing around with my old Galaxy S10e and I went back to using the back button instantly, there was no gesture habit to break or re-learning of Android UI.</li>\n<li><strong>SD Card/Storage:</strong> I miss the SD card or larger cheap built in storage. Even Android mgfs are getting rid of SD cards, but there are still some that offer it.</li>\n<li><strong>Locked experience:</strong> I never got used to the locked ecosystem, I like to Side load apps that aren't available or are restricted by geographical location. For example Hulu. I could easily side load it on Android and use a VPN, whereas on Apple, it requires way more steps by changing apple ID's location then logging into the US app store etc. Too much of a hassle.</li>\n<li><strong>Face ID:</strong> It was ok, but they need to introduce touchID to complement the FaceID. Between the two, I would prefer the Fingerprint sensor. I know some diehard fans who prefer faceID bar none. Masks didn't help with the Face ID this year. And I heard some rumors that Apple might have improved faceID enabling it to work with Masks on iPhone 13. I guess we'll see, but Apple, why not leave your stubbornness behind and just introduce TouchID, either under the display or in the power button.</li>\n<li><strong>Widgets:</strong> I'm really glad they introduced widgets, but they have a long way to go to catch up to Android. I still could never find the proper widget that took up half of one of the home screens, that displayed a full month calendar, like this: <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/lBP3QUG.jpeg\">https://i.imgur.com/lBP3QUG.jpeg</a></li>\n<li><strong>No Airdrop Alternative:</strong> I'm a Windows user, and I searched for an Airdrop alternative that would work on Windows, but couldn't come up with anything. I used to use pushbullet, where I could right click on an image on a webpage and click \"send to the phone\" using pushbullet and it would download on the phone right away. Pushbullet took their app off the app store because Apple required them to use appleID for logging in or something like that.</li>\n<li><strong>Keyboard:</strong> I don't know what it is, but I make way more errors while typing on iPhone than I did with Android. I thought maybe it was the screen size, but my S10e was roughly the same size as the iPhone 11 Pro. I use Gboard on both, but apparently Gboard is severely crippled on the iPhone. I remember when Gboard was released on iOS before Android, I was so jealous, because the Samsung keyboard used to suck. The Gboard appears and behaves differently on iOS compared to Android.</li>\n<li><strong>Always On Display &amp; Notifications:</strong> I really miss the Android notifications, Apple's notifications have vastly improved but nowhere near Android level. The way they are displayed and grouped on Android is way better than iOS. I do see that Apple made some improvements to notifications in iOS15. And in addition to that the AOD was awesome. I used to have the notification LED on earlier Samsungs till they switched to AOD. Now with the iPhone being an OLED display, why hasn't Apple adopted this yet?</li>\n<li><strong>Transferring files and photos:</strong> This is what pissed me off yesterday. My phone ran out of space so I couldn't send any attachments so I thought I'd plug the phone into my laptop and transfer all the pictures and videos to my HDD. Apparently Apple doesn't store pictures and videos in the DCIM folder anymore, they're embedded somewhere. So my only option was to use iCloud to sync photos onto my laptop or download each one or thousand at a time from <a href=\"https://icloud.com\">icloud.com</a>.</li>\n<li>BUT, they weren't even full resolution, even when I clicked to download the unmodified original. Anyways, the main issue was that I had to download almost 10GB worth of media from icloud which essentially eats up my data and my internet speed is only 5-10mbps (waiting for Starlink). I tried looking for other ways to get the photos and videos out of my phone, but nothing worked. Bought AnyTrans software for like $100 and it only pulled 60 photos from the phone then told me that the rest of the images are on the cloud. Tried to use Microsoft photo transfer and the same thing, it only got 60 pictures as well. Now I need to go somewhere else with fast LTE or wifi and download the media so I can delete them and clear up some space. And if they are stored on iCloud only, then why is my storage showing its full?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>No Libraries and file system:</strong> All the photos end up in one library and the file system in general sucks. The Android file system is years ahead.</li>\n<li><strong>Design and features:</strong> The design is outdated, 60hz screen and big notch. It is common knowledge that Apple likes to polish everything before releasing, whereas Android Mfgs can release more experimental features like folding screens, under display cameras and fingerprint sensors. But it seems Apple has been taking longer and longer to polish stuff. I'll come back to Apple, once they release a phone with everything under the display and the front is just a screen, and there is no port lol. I guess we will see if the iPhone 13 has a higher refresh rate screen and sports a smaller notch.</li>\n<li><strong>No USB-C:</strong> I have a lot of USB-C cables around but I had to invest into buying Lightning to USB-C cables and leave them in a few places, so I always had them where I needed them. Still, as even apple fans agree, Lightning needs to go, and they need to bring usb-c to the iPhone instead of ditching the lightning for no port and relying on mag-safe.</li>\n<li><strong>Apple invading your privacy to protect the children:</strong> It was really cool when Apple came out with a policy that required all the apps to ask if they could track the users. Facebook, Instagram and likes were losing their shit because they couldn't target ads anymore.</li>\n<li>But now Apple wants to scan people's shit to look for child porn? That's cool but I don't think they'll stop there. Apple is scummy to use the children as an excuse to force their way into people's shit. Apple made it so that if you are against this, then you are probably a pedo who doesn't want apple looking at their pictures, or you probably enable child predators. Fuck all that, I want predators caught, but I also don't want apple to scan my stuff. They better spend billions of dollars and create a think tank to figure out a way around this invasion of privacy.</li>\n<li><strong>Apple the industry trendsetter:</strong> It's a shame that the industry uses Apple as the leader and adopts whatever revenue generating trends it sets. Such as ditching the headphone jack to sell bluetooth headphones, expensive phone storage to sell cloud storage, Ditching the power brick to go \"green\" and save the environment. It certainly wasn't to sell the power brick as a marked-up accessory, nope. It was to save the environment by making the iPhone packaging smaller meanwhile the power brick came in its own unnecessary packaging.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Things I will miss if I move back to Android:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Air tags:</strong> I like these little things, I have easily found my wallet and keys with the iPhone and tags</li>\n<li><strong>Seamless Sync:</strong> It seems the iPhone connects to other things easily without much input or steps.</li>\n<li><strong>Blue imessage text bubbles</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Apple Pay</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I switched to iOS from Android, because I was bored and wanted to try out the iPhone and see what had changed from when I used to have my 3GS. A year was a good break from Android and gave me some perspective of iOS users.</p>\n<p>So I'm going to wait and see what Improvements the 13 has and see if it has solved some of my issues. If it is relatively unchanged then I'll be looking for a new Galaxy phone or maybe try a different Android phone.</p></div>",

Unfortunately, this is just a part of city life and leaving a nice bike out in the public, even if locked up. In most cases, this would be the end of the story, as most stolen bikes are never recovered.</p>\n<p>Two weeks prior to the theft, I placed an Apple AirTag under the seat. Within minutes of the bike being stolen, I received an alert on my phone that the bike was left behind. I knew the lock had been broken and that my bike was on the move. I was immediately able to track the movement of the thief in the Find My app. They took an urban river trail which was close enough to get pings from several iPhones along the way. I tracked it to a local \"tent city\" and then called the police to recover it. I didn't want to engage them directly, but unfortunately the police arrived 15 minutes too late. The bike was on the move again in a vehicle this time, but luckily the thief had no idea it was being tracked. I was getting location updates about every 5 minutes while it was in the car. I following the pings as closely as possible. I assume that iPhones in passing cars were providing pings for location updates. Eventually it stopped at a local gas station and I used Precision Finding to track it down to the exact car, where I could see the bike through the window. I confronted the driver with the police on the phone, proved I owned it with a matching serial number, and they gave it back immediately.</p>\n<p>I realize that AirTags are not a perfect solution, but there's no way I would have recovered the bike otherwise, and I am ecstatic that I don't have to buy a new one!</p></div>",

However, I had a pressing question. Given that the pandemic was still ongoing, and I was doing Zoom University, <strong>was it okay to just leave my laptop plugged into the charger all the time?</strong> After all, I rarely left home, it was treated more like a desktop than a laptop.</p>\n<p>Apple has a wealth of <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/batteries/maximizing-performance/\">support documents</a> on battery life and longevity. They go to great lengths to explain charge cycles and whatnot. However, nowhere on the website does Apple address the issue of leaving a laptop plugged in v. cycling the battery over a long period of time. I mean it\u2019s a niche situation to begin with, but I still wanted answers.</p>\n<p>I next tried a simple Google search, but there is so much contradictory information online. Some say it\u2019s perfectly okay, others say it degrades the battery because batteries don\u2019t like being kept at a full charge. Some say it\u2019s okay, but that you should cycle the battery once a month, while others remark that batteries don\u2019t have a \u201cmemory\u201d and so that practice is unnecessary. Some say keeping it on the charger is best for batteries because that will result in fewer cycles\u2014plus, the battery \u201ctrickle charges\u201d anyway. Still, others counter that leaving Macs plugged in all the time degrades the battery because of heat.</p>\n<p>Thoroughly confused, I reached out to Apple support via chat. Support said that whether or not to keep a laptop plugged in was a \u201cpersonal preference.\u201d I asked if it even mattered because when a Mac is plugged into power it runs off AC power, and she confirmed this but clarified that the battery still drains anyway?</p>\n<p>With no clear answer, I sent an email to Tim Cook with hopes that the executive office could direct me to someone with the right answer. T2 support or a battery engineer or something. I know what you\u2019re thinking, \u201cwho cares?\u201d I mean I wasn\u2019t expecting my battery to be and behave like it was factory new a year or two later. I just wanted confirmation, <em>from Apple</em>, that such a practice was safe, and that it wouldn\u2019t totally destroy my battery so I could rely on it when I could eventually start taking my new Mac out and about again. Anyway, no one responded to that email.</p>\n<p>Now it\u2019s been a year. With a few exceptions such as travel, my MacBook Pro has been plugged into power daily, 24/7, whether I\u2019m actively using it or not. I also seldom shut it down, just put it to sleep, though I do most of my work on an iPad. With a year of this behavior, how do the battery stats look?</p>\n<p>Charge Information:</p>\n<p>Charge Remaining (mAh): 4405</p>\n<p>Fully Charged:    Yes</p>\n<p>Charging: No</p>\n<p>Full Charge Capacity (mAh): 4502</p>\n<p>Health Information:</p>\n<p>Cycle Count: 43</p>\n<p>Condition: Normal</p>\n<p>Battery Installed: Yes</p>\n<p>Amperage (mA): 0</p>\n<p>Voltage (mV): 12558</p>\n<p>Less than 100 mAh down and only 43 cycles in one year. Like I said, I wasn\u2019t expecting a brand new battery. My only concern was whether performance would be severely degrading by basically never cycling the battery. A year later we have our answer: No.</p>\n<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Leaving your Mac laptop connected to power all the time is perfectly safe, and won\u2019t negatively degrade battery life.</p></div>",

There are absolutely legitimate concerns around the potential for this system to be abused by oppressive regimes from around the world.</p>\n<p>This conversation needs to happen.  For me, the line from the letter congratulating Team Apple and telling them to ignore the \u201cscreeching voice of the minority\u201d was where Apple lost me in this battle until they can provide absolute guarantees that this CAN NEVER BE ABUSED\u2026 EVER.</p>\n<p>That line told me that there is no interest in having this conversation.  At all.  Organizations that will benefit from this have zero interest in ensuring privacy for everyone else, including those that could be political targets in certain regions of the world.</p>\n<p>The apparatus that Apple has built uses \u201cfor the children\u201d as an excuse to build the framework, but that framework can absolutely be adapted.  If anyone thinks that Apple wouldn\u2019t roll over if told \u201cyou will scan for these images in China or we won\u2019t allow you to sell here\u201d, remember this.  Apple boasted just a couple of years ago that \u201cwhat happens on your iPhone stays on your iPhone\u201d and this week seems to have amended that with, \u201cwell, except where we make exceptions.\u201d</p>\n<p>This won\u2019t be the end of intrusion.  I hate child exploitation as much as anyone, but I also hate the potential for governments to attack, for example, those with LBGT imagery or unpalatable political imagery\u201d on these same devices.</p>\n<p>Yes, TODAY, the database is CSAM, but tomorrow, it could be something else.  That is the danger here and why we need to push Apple to rethink this direction or make ironclad guarantees that the worst CAN\u2019T happen, but I don\u2019t think the latter is possible.</p></div>",

I\u2019ve spent close to $30k on Apple products in my lifetime.</p>\n<p>Today I\u2019m spending $4k+ on a custom built PC and it\u2019s going to be a huge pain to transition to PC, learn windows or Linux, etc. but I feel that I must.</p>\n<p>Apple tricked us into believing that their platform is safe, private, and secure. Privacy is a huge issue for me; as a victim of CP, I believe very strongly in fighting CP \u2014 but this is just not the way. </p>\n<p>I\u2019ve worked in software and there will be so many false positives. There always are. </p>\n<p>So I\u2019m done. I\u2019m not paying a premium price for iCloud &amp; Apple devices just to be spied on. </p>\n<p>I don\u2019t care how it works, every system is eventually flawed and encryption only works until it\u2019s decrypted. </p>\n<p>Best of luck to you, Apple. I hope you change your mind. This is invasive. This isn\u2019t ok.</p>\n<p>Edit: You all are welcome to hate on me, call me reactive, tell me it\u2019s a poorly thought out decision. You\u2019re welcome to call me stupid or a moron, but please leave me alone when it comes to calling me a liar because I said I\u2019m a CP victim. I\u2019ve had a lot of therapy for c-ptsd, but being told that I\u2019m making it up hurts me in a way that I can\u2019t even convey. Please just\u2026 leave it alone.</p></div>",

Whoever has that picture on their phone will be detected and reported (if they forget to turn off iCloud which is on by default). This gives government even more powerful tools than having access to all your iCloud photos, because they will be alerted if there\u2019s a match. Normally I don\u2019t think government will look into all citizens\u2019 photo</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This technology can extend to audio files or documents on your phone. Apple can say they don\u2019t read or hear the document, just generate a hash signature of them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Apple said it can only see photos if it passes a certain matching threshold but this threshold is controlled solely by Apple. If it decides to lower the threshold to zero, all photos will become visible to them. This is a backdoor to bypass encryption and will surely be exploited.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Hashes of known illegal images are stored on devices. So it a device get hacked or jailbroken, someone can technically modify this list.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ambiguity of jurisdiction: if this is applicable to the U.S., then who are subject to this law? Is it based on the device serial number (sold in US market), or based on iCloud details registration, or location of the phone, or user nationality? If a Russian visits the U.S. with a matching photo, will he be reported? This can create a lot of confusion</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Most importantly, this creates a precedence. Knowing Apple can do this, government will surely ask for more. </p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Please share your thoughts or let me know if my understanding is incorrect</p></div>",

Write Apple on their feedback page <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/feedback/\">here</a> or I think it would be more relevant to notify them of the issue on their report page specifically for security and privacy threats <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201220\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Make it loud and clear that this is not okay and if they decide to actually implement these authoritarian and privacy violating changes, you will sell your phone and stop doing business with them.

However, some users are beginning to show frustration that this topic is dominating the sub\u2019s feed.</p>\n<p>Today, there is unlikely to be any new news from Apple about these features, and it therefore seems reasonable to keep the discussion centralized to one place.</p>\n<p>Please comment and discuss below freely (but please keep it civil). Thank you.</p>\n<p><strong>EDIT: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/p00hc4/the_community_has_spoken_out_of_a_total_of_240/\">A poll was run</a> to see if users wanted this kept to a megathread or if we should open the sub back up to all submissions. By a razer thin margin of 119 to 121 at the time of closing (4PM EST), decision has been made to open the floodgates. We still ask everyone to follow the rules when posting and treat each other with respect, but this megathread is now unstickied and we are back to the races. This thread will stay up to preserve the discussion within. Thanks for participating everyone!</strong></p></div>",
