Reddit wants me, and by extension, you to use their damned app to consume the content people like us generate. As a matter of principle, I refuse to install their native app where I have zero control over what's shown to me. (Plus it's horrible to use!)</p>\n<p>Harder for us to block ads and much easier for them to scoop up your data, right? To further that agenda, simply browsing their web version on Safari now means we\u2019re inundated with, well, waves of crap. </p>\n<p>It might be a modal covering half the screen with links to the App Store, an immediate popup asking you to login, or a header screaming \u201cthe app is 10x better\u201d. Bottomline: it has to go. </p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Introducing Sink It</strong></p>\n<p>Finally fed up, I\u2019ve built a super tiny, super minimal Safari web extension to deal with this BS. It\u2019s called Sink It for Reddit. You can get it on the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sink-it-for-reddit/id6449873635\">App Store</a>.</p>\n<p>Sink It is completely free and has <strong>no BS \u2014 no ads, no in-app purchases, and no subscriptions</strong>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>What does it do?</strong></p>\n<p>Currently, it removes most \"zomg please use our app\u201d banners as well as login nags from Reddit. It also removes most \"promoted\" posts. </p>\n<p>If you're up against companies as big as Reddit, it's a constant tug of war. Reddit particularly hates it when we tinker with the web version and does some shenanigans internally to break the extension. I've listed down <a href=\"https://gorekt.com/sinkit/common-issues\">a few issues</a> users are facing and how to fix them. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s also extremely minimal by design. The app <em>doesn\u2019t track behavioral or usage history</em> including keeping a count of how many times it has blocked pop ups or have fancy widgets or analytics. </p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Privacy First</strong></p>\n<p>All the functionality/pattern matching/blocking happens on your device with no data getting exfiltrated. Even something as regular as app analytics or telemetry has been stripped away in the name of privacy. </p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>\ud83d\udc4b\ud83c\udffc</strong></p>\n<p>Thanks for reading this wall of text and I do hope you\u2019ll give Sink It a shot. I know a lot of you have gotten equally annoyed as me with what Reddit is doing these days.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>PS: <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/XGw1ys8.jpg\">The irony of advertising a Reddit nag nuking app on Reddit.. </a></p></div>",

Some will return after 48 hours: others will go away <em>permanently</em> unless the issue is adequately addressed, since many moderators aren't able to put in the work they do with the poor tools available through the official app. This isn't something any of us do lightly: we do what we do because <em>we love Reddit</em>, and we truly believe this change will make it impossible to keep doing what we love.</p>\n<p>The two-day blackout isn't the <em>goal</em>, and it isn't the end. Should things reach the 14th with no sign of Reddit choosing to fix what they've broken, we'll use the community and buzz we've built between then and now as a tool for further action.</p>\n<p>What can <em>you</em> do?</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Complain.</strong> Message the mods of /r/reddit.com, who are the admins of the site: message /u/reddit: submit a <a href=\"https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\">support request</a>: comment in relevant threads on /r/reddit, such as <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/.\">this one</a>, leave a negative review on their official iOS or Android app- and sign your username in support to this post.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Spread the word.</strong> Rabble-rouse on related subreddits. Meme it up, make it spicy. Bitch about it to your cat. Suggest anyone you know who moderates a subreddit join us at our sister sub at /r/ModCoord  - but please don't pester mods you <em>don't</em> know by simply spamming their modmail.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Boycott <em>and</em> spread the word...to Reddit's competition!</strong> Stay off Reddit entirely on June 12th through the 13th- instead, take to your favorite <em>non</em>-Reddit platform of choice and make some noise in support!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Don't be a jerk.</strong> As upsetting this may be, threats, profanity and vandalism will be worse than useless in getting people on our side.

We've been posting around, getting valuable feedback from users, and improving the experience on the web and mainly our iOS app. In today's world, catchy headlines and articles often distract readers from the facts and relevant information. By utilizing OpenAI's language models, Boring Report processes sensationalist news articles, transforms them into the content you see, and helps readers focus on the essential details. There is still a lot of work to be done, such as localization, additional processing of source material, and further user customization. Please try the iPhone/iPad app + share extension, and give us your feedback so we can keep improving the product. Thank you for the support!</p>\n<p>You can get updates by following us:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/boringreport\">Twitter</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/BoringReport/\">r/BoringReport</a></p></div>",
