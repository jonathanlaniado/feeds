With much of Apple\u2019s supply chain still based in China, this raises questions about whether we\u2019ll see higher prices on iPhones, Macs, and other Apple devices.</p>\n<p>In the past, Apple successfully secured tariff waivers under Trump\u2019s administration, but given the current political climate, it\u2019s unclear if they\u2019ll be able to do that again. Tim Cook has historically worked to maintain strong ties with government officials\u2014including attending Trump\u2019s inauguration\u2014but Apple\u2019s DEI initiatives could still make them a target. Trump has already taken action against companies with DEI policies, so could this put Apple in the crosshairs?</p>\n<p>A few questions for the community:</p>\n<p>Do you think Apple will absorb the tariff costs, or will we see price hikes? </p>\n<p>Is there a chance Apple secures another waiver, or is this the time they get hit? </p>\n<p>Could Apple\u2019s focus on DEI make them more of a target, even after Tim Cook\u2019s efforts to stay in good standing with the administration?</p>",
