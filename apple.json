However, I had a pressing question. Given that the pandemic was still ongoing, and I was doing Zoom University, <strong>was it okay to just leave my laptop plugged into the charger all the time?</strong> After all, I rarely left home, it was treated more like a desktop than a laptop.</p>\n<p>Apple has a wealth of <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/batteries/maximizing-performance/\">support documents</a> on battery life and longevity. They go to great lengths to explain charge cycles and whatnot. However, nowhere on the website does Apple address the issue of leaving a laptop plugged in v. cycling the battery over a long period of time. I mean it\u2019s a niche situation to begin with, but I still wanted answers.</p>\n<p>I next tried a simple Google search, but there is so much contradictory information online. Some say it\u2019s perfectly okay, others say it degrades the battery because batteries don\u2019t like being kept at a full charge. Some say it\u2019s okay, but that you should cycle the battery once a month, while others remark that batteries don\u2019t have a \u201cmemory\u201d and so that practice is unnecessary. Some say keeping it on the charger is best for batteries because that will result in fewer cycles\u2014plus, the battery \u201ctrickle charges\u201d anyway. Still, others counter that leaving Macs plugged in all the time degrades the battery because of heat.</p>\n<p>Thoroughly confused, I reached out to Apple support via chat. Support said that whether or not to keep a laptop plugged in was a \u201cpersonal preference.\u201d I asked if it even mattered because when a Mac is plugged into power it runs off AC power, and she confirmed this but clarified that the battery still drains anyway?</p>\n<p>With no clear answer, I sent an email to Tim Cook with hopes that the executive office could direct me to someone with the right answer. T2 support or a battery engineer or something. I know what you\u2019re thinking, \u201cwho cares?\u201d I mean I wasn\u2019t expecting my battery to be and behave like it was factory new a year or two later. I just wanted confirmation, <em>from Apple</em>, that such a practice was safe, and that it wouldn\u2019t totally destroy my battery so I could rely on it when I could eventually start taking my new Mac out and about again. Anyway, no one responded to that email.</p>\n<p>Now it\u2019s been a year. With a few exceptions such as travel, my MacBook Pro has been plugged into power daily, 24/7, whether I\u2019m actively using it or not. I also seldom shut it down, just put it to sleep, though I do most of my work on an iPad. With a year of this behavior, how do the battery stats look?</p>\n<p>Charge Information:</p>\n<p>Charge Remaining (mAh): 4405</p>\n<p>Fully Charged:    Yes</p>\n<p>Charging: No</p>\n<p>Full Charge Capacity (mAh): 4502</p>\n<p>Health Information:</p>\n<p>Cycle Count: 43</p>\n<p>Condition: Normal</p>\n<p>Battery Installed: Yes</p>\n<p>Amperage (mA): 0</p>\n<p>Voltage (mV): 12558</p>\n<p>Less than 100 mAh down and only 43 cycles in one year. Like I said, I wasn\u2019t expecting a brand new battery. My only concern was whether performance would be severely degrading by basically never cycling the battery. A year later we have our answer: No.</p>\n<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Leaving your Mac laptop connected to power all the time is perfectly safe, and won\u2019t negatively degrade battery life.</p></div>",

If anyone thinks that Apple wouldn\u2019t roll over if told \u201cyou will scan for these images in China or we won\u2019t allow you to sell here\u201d, remember this.  Apple boasted just a couple of years ago that \u201cwhat happens on your iPhone stays on your iPhone\u201d and this week seems to have amended that with, \u201cwell, except where we make exceptions.\u201d</p>\n<p>This won\u2019t be the end of intrusion.  I hate child exploitation as much as anyone, but I also hate the potential for governments to attack, for example, those with LBGT imagery or unpalatable political imagery\u201d on these same devices.</p>\n<p>Yes, TODAY, the database is CSAM, but tomorrow, it could be something else.  That is the danger here and why we need to push Apple to rethink this direction or make ironclad guarantees that the worst CAN\u2019T happen, but I don\u2019t think the latter is possible.</p></div>",

Whoever has that picture on their phone will be detected and reported (if they forget to turn off iCloud which is on by default). This gives government even more powerful tools than having access to all your iCloud photos, because they will be alerted if there\u2019s a match. Normally I don\u2019t think government will look into all citizens\u2019 photo</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This technology can extend to audio files or documents on your phone. Apple can say they don\u2019t read or hear the document, just generate a hash signature of them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Apple said it can only see photos if it passes a certain matching threshold but this threshold is controlled solely by Apple. If it decides to lower the threshold to zero, all photos will become visible to them. This is a backdoor to bypass encryption and will surely be exploited.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Hashes of known illegal images are stored on devices. So it a device get hacked or jailbroken, someone can technically modify this list.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ambiguity of jurisdiction: if this is applicable to the U.S., then who are subject to this law? Is it based on the device serial number (sold in US market), or based on iCloud details registration, or location of the phone, or user nationality? If a Russian visits the U.S. with a matching photo, will he be reported? This can create a lot of confusion</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Most importantly, this creates a precedence. Knowing Apple can do this, government will surely ask for more. </p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Please share your thoughts or let me know if my understanding is incorrect</p></div>",

So where are the limits?</p>\n<p>What\u2019s to stop Apple from implementing \u201cprivate and secure\u201d measures in HomeKit, for the greater good? </p>\n<p>Will they develop ML algorithms to monitor all HomeKit camera feeds for any, potentially criminal, activity? These algorithms could have a very high threshold of security, only flagging your recordings if they reach a certain threshold of likely criminality. Then an Apple employee could review the footage personally, before sending it to authorities. </p>\n<p>If you\u2019re not doing anything wrong, there\u2019s nothing to worry about, right? </p>\n<p>What about smart door locks? Why shouldn\u2019t Apple develop a program to grant law enforcement agencies digital keys to people\u2019s homes, in certain situations? Maybe you fall and your Apple Watch calls emergency services, who can get in your house, without having to break your door down. There\u2019s no harm in that, right? </p>\n<p>Once encryption, along with measures to protect user privacy and security, are subject to whatever moral principles Apple has decided are more important \u2014 suddenly these protections mean nothing. They\u2019re a secure vault from the front, but the back is nothing more than cardboard, held on with office tape.</p>\n<p>Edit: It just occurred to me that in the exact same update that\u2019s going to introduce this  new, on device, CSAM hash comparison, for iCloud users \u2014 Apple is also introducing unlimited HomeKit security camera storage, for paid iCloud subscribers.</p></div>",

Same for reviews, I can\u2019t look at the reviews unless I use Yelp. </p>\n<p>Apple needs to integrate Google reviews, or forget yelp all together and create their own review platform on Apple Maps. </p>\n<p>Yelp is bad, hurts small business, and is annoying as all get out when trying to use Apple Maps. The Yelp app also skims huge amounts of personal data. </p>\n<p>I should not have to download a 3rd party review app that steals my data to look at a picture of a business in Apple Maps. </p>\n<p>The fact that this is my least favorite part about Apple products may be a good thing depending on how you look at it, but it\u2019s truly annoying. I use Apple Maps to search for businesses/restaurants all the time.</p>\n<p>Edit: if Apple could even integrate it in a way where I did not need to have Yelp installed, I probably wouldn\u2019t care they used them at all. It\u2019s just the fact that one of their (major) first party apps, requires a third party app to be downloaded in order to unlock all functionality of said app. Very non Apple like.</p></div>",
