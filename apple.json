            "content_html": "<p>There's been a lot of rumours that a new 16\" and first-ever 14\" MacBook Pro will be released in the third or fourth quarter of the year [<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/14-inch-macbook-pro/\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/news/macbook-pro-14-inch-2021-release-date-price-news-and-leaks\">2</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.co.uk/news/14-inch-macbook-pro-3787300/\">3</a>, <a href=\"https://appleinsider.com/inside/14-inch-macbook-pro\">4</a>, <a href=\"https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-macbook-pro-2021-release-date-price-specs-and-design-4112058\">5</a>].</p>\n<p>Apart from the rumoured 1080p webcam, the return of HDMI and other ports and a new design, one feature seems especially interesting - the new M1X chip. Especially the fact that the new chip will supposedly have either 16 or 32 GPU cores compared to the current 8 cores in the M1 chip.</p>\n<p>The current M1 GPU is often compared to an Nvidia GTX 1650 (Mobile) in terms of performance. Based on the fact that the new M1X GPU will have either 2x or 4x the cores of the M1 GPU, I assume that we can expect it to be either 2x or 4x faster.</p>\n<p>If it would be 2x faster, that would make it equivalent to an Nvidia RTX 3060 (Mobile). However, the 32-core version assumed to be 4x faster than the current 8-core GPU would be equivalent to an RTX 3070-Ti (Desktop) while being 30% faster than RTX 3080 (Mobile). I picked the equivalents based on the data from UserBenchmark [<a href=\"https://gpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Nvidia-GTX-1650-Mobile-vs-Nvidia-RTX-3060-Laptop/m775280vsm1452971\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://gpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Nvidia-GTX-1650-Mobile-vs-Nvidia-RTX-3070-Ti/m775280vs4116\">2</a>, <a href=\"https://gpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Nvidia-RTX-3080-Laptop-vs-Nvidia-RTX-3070-Ti/m1443565vs4116\">3</a>].</p>\n<p>Do you think it's possible for the upcoming M1X integrated GPU to be comparable in performance to current high-end dedicated GPUs?</p>",

This would also improve the battery health of the phones in the long term.</p>\n<p>I think there is no reason to not implement this kind of features (people who don't know what they are doing won't touch such feature anyways, I think).</p>\n<p>What do you guys think?</p>",

I've used other mainstream headphones, such as Beats, Sony, Bose, JBL, etc. (although I have not tried newer ones from the last 2 years),  and none have come close to that wonderful noise-cancellation and noise-transparency that the Airpods Max have. But the price tag scared me... </p>\n<p>I am not an adult that is financially responsible with a steady salary, just a college kid, so you can understand why the price tag bums me out. But I worked hard this summer and I think I deserve something nice.</p>\n<p>I have read that if your not deep in the Apple Ecosystem then is no-go. I wouldn't say I am deep but I am not out of it also. My main tool is my iPad, I use it for everything music (I use Apple Music), college, writing, entertainment, and pretty much everything. But I do not have an iPhone.</p>\n<p>Finally, I do not want Airpods/Airpods Pro (really any of these pods,buds) because they damage my ear, I have always preferred over/on-the-ear headphones because of this.</p>\n<p>I have seen many YouTube videos, but I would like an advice given my \"story\" (if you can call it that).</p>\n<p>So what would your advice be?</p>\n<p>For now I am thinking of waiting till Black Friday or Cyber Monday (and have seen price drops on Amazon).</p>",

            "title": "Why do Apple's media services apps suck so bad?",
            "content_html": "<p>Compared to the other Apple's native apps (Safari, Reminders, Notes, iMessage etc) their media services apps are generally slow, clunky and have bad UX/UI. Here is why:</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><strong>Apple Music:</strong> Everything feels zoomed in 150% with thumbnails so big it's hard to navigate. The app is slow and drops frames like crazy on older iPhones. It's filled with bugs like the recent one where the dolby atmos/lossless songs were stopping at 15 seconds, and it took them 1+ month to fix it (with iOS 14.7 which isn't out yet). It takes 5 seconds to load on app launch and when you click on a playlist/album the tracks take another 2-3 seconds to show the songs. The love/add to playlist buttons is hidden within the ... button. The shuffle/repeat buttons are hidden within the queue. It has a redundant volume slider which we have hardware buttons for that. The player swipe up animation is clunky, it doesn't follow your finger and it doesn't swipe up until your finger is half way through the screen. But it swipes down just fine. If you're making a short swipe left-right on the playlists it refuses to swipe and stutters back to the same position, you need a bigger finger swipe for it to actually move. Search is slow. You can't make folders and sort Apple's curated playlists. </p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><strong>Apple Podcasts:</strong> Everything feels zoomed in 150% with thumbnails so big it's hard to navigate. The player swipe up animation is clunky, it doesn't follow your finger and it doesn't swipe up until your finger is half way through the screen. But it swipes down just fine. New episodes sometimes don't show up until much later. Episodes shownotes don't support basic html tags. On a podcast page the follow button is a small \"+\" all the way up which is hard to tap and it takes a good 2-3 seconds to respond with a huge popup which takes half of your screen, while the main center button is \"play latest episode\". Even if you dig into the app settings and tick the option to not download every episode from podcasts you follow, it downloads them anyway.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><strong>Apple TV+:</strong> The app feels much smoother than Music &amp; Podcats and thank god they added a dedicated TV+ tab. The Movies/TV Shows you add to your list and the \"continue watching\" are mixed into a \"Up Next\" category which isn't on the TV+ tab, they should also be separated. The player sometimes doesn't show the \"Skip Intro\" button and sometimes randomly when the episode ends it doesn't start the next episode automatically which gives the impression that the TV Show ended there. The whole thing with adding hundreds of other streaming services in there and even dedicated purchases feels too confusing, the TV+ should have a dedicated app. If you start watching a tv show and the next episode is next week, does it send a notification to remind you that the next episode is up?</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> I don't really get why these apps don't get the same love and attention compared to the other native apps. Especially considering these are paid subscriptions and the whole services strategy is how Apple wants to grow and keep making money now that people aren't upgrading their iPhones every 1-2 years. I want Apple to take my money, but I can't give it to them if their services are inferior to competition. Some of the issues are so dumb that I genuinely think the developer teams in charge of these apps don't actually use their services on a daily basis, they should be fired imo.</p>",

Needless to say, this machine is old. I've gone through 2 other MacBooks since getting this Mac Mini.</p>\n<p>Using this <em>8 year old</em> machine, I am impressed by how fast this machine still is and just how well it still works. I originally pulled it out of storage to erase the hard drive so that I can sell it, but I'm not so sure I actually want to sell it anymore - it probably won't have much resell value anyways. I might just sell my current 2016 15\" MacBook instead (least favorite Mac by far and don't need the portability). The only downer is that the 2012 Mac Mini can't do 4K. Maybe there's a nostalgia factor going on here, but does anyone else miss the Macs of yesteryear, when they were user-upgradeable?</p>\n<p>Edit: Just checked eBay. This Mac Mini is still going for almost $300 with similar specs.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>Hi Apple  fan family \ud83d\udc4b I'm Khoa, a long-time open source, tech writer and indie Mac developer.</p>\n<p>I'm also a long-time Mac user and there are many features I need badly that is not supported by Mac or hard to use, so I make Almighty.</p>\n<p>Almighty is a native Mac app written in pure Swift and SwiftUI to supercharge your Mac experience by providing easy-to-use tweaks and some extra utilities to boost your productivity.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>\ud83d\ude85 A Long List of Tweaks and Utilities</p>\n<p>Some of the current tweaks included, and I'm constantly adding more</p>\n<p>\u2615\ufe0fKeep Mac Awake: Prevent computer from idle sleeping</p>\n<p>\u2328\ufe0f Lock keyboard: Obscure keyboard input</p>\n<p>\ud83d\udebf Clear clipboard: Clear contents on system clipboard</p>\n<p>\ud83e\udd41 Visualize key strokes</p>\n<p>\ud83e\udd18Visualize cursor</p>\n<p>\ud83d\udcc1Hide all applications: Minimize all application windows</p>\n<p>\ud83d\udef8Hide menu bar items</p>\n<p>\ud83d\udef3 Keep Dock Position: Reposition Dock back to primary display</p>\n<p>\ud83d\uddc2 Disable file structure sync: Disable automatically organizing files on disk</p>\n<p>\ud83d\ude48 Show hidden files: Show or hide hidden files in Finder</p>\n<p>\ud83d\udda5 Show Desktop icons: Show or hide icons on Desktop</p>\n<p>\ud83d\udced Auto plain text: convert copied to plain text</p>\n<p>\ud83c\udf11 Black out: turn the screen black</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>\ud83e\uddd0 Some of you may wonder that some of these tweaks can be done via Apple Script or command line. While this is true, it's tedious and you have to remember all the command and parameters, plus it's easy to get wrong and not that many are tech-savvy or care enough to do. I used to keep a list of some commands I need often, but then I wish for a Mac app like Almighty so I can just click and save time to do some other important works</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>\ud83d\udcbb Available also on Mac AppStore</p>\n<p>I initially make Almighty as a standalone Mac app with payment by Paddle. Some have asked me to submit to AppStore as well, so did I. Due to some discussions with AppStore reviewers that I've reduced the numbers of tweaks for Mac version (for now, I will add more later) so you know that Almighty is available both as standalone and in Mac AppStore</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>\ud83d\udef0 What about Shortcut in Mac Monterey</p>\n<p>Every tweak in Almighty can be configured and assigned keyboard shortcut so you can execute faster and more convenient. You can also group in workflow and show your favorite workflow in menu bar too.</p>\n<p>I initially plan to have my own voice command system, but as you know from WWDC21 Mac Monterey has Shortcuts support, Almighty will then donate all of its tweaks to Shortcuts app so you can access them even easier.</p>\n<p>\ud83d\udd25 Thanks to many who joined beta and those provided feedback, I'm constantly adding more features and utilities to Almighty. Any suggestion is more than welcome.</p>\n<p>Hope you find the app useful, it has trial period with access to all tweaks with unlimited use so you can see if it provides some value to you. I often post updates at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/getalmighty\">https://twitter.com/getalmighty</a> and you can find more info at <a href=\"https://onmyway133.com/almighty/\">https://onmyway133.com/almighty/</a></p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Thanks a lot for checking and have a nice day &amp; stay safe \u2764\ufe0f</p>",

One of his colleagues recalls a visit there: \u201cI remember going into Steve\u2019s house and he had almost no furniture in it. He just had a picture of Einstein, whom he admired greatly, and he had a Tiffany lamp and a chair and a bed. He just didn\u2019t believe in having lots of things around but he was incredibly careful in what he selected.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Before I go getting all inspired, is this true?

            "title": "A Case for Touch ID in 2021",
            "content_html": "<p>It's 2021 but I'm still craning my neck, entering my passcode multiple times a day, staring at a notch, and the Apple Pay experience is worse than it used to be.  Check out my admittedly whiney reasons as to why Touch ID still has merit!</p>\n<p>TLDR - Face ID is superior for in phone usage like passwords, autofill, and app authentication, but for unlocking the phone and apple pay, Touch ID is superior.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The Long Neck</strong>.  The number one reason (personally) against Face ID and for Touch ID is when your phone is lying flat on a surface next to or in front of you and you want to use it without holding it.  I can't imagine I am the only person who has their phone in front of them on a desk or table and you want to wake and authenticate the phone without picking it up.  So, in order to do that, you tap the screen and then awkwardly hover over your phone and/or stick your neck out to get to the home screen and then continue to use your phone.  Touch ID, wake <em>and</em> authenticate with one move, awesome.  I miss that. \u00a0</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Rest Finger to Open.</strong> \u00a0This was such an underrated feature, as it meant that in the process of waking the phone (with either a click or raising) you were also authenticating to actually blow by the notification screen right to the home screen. \u00a0This may seem small, but this would allow you to wake and authenticate the phone straight from your pocket.  This also lines up with a ridiculous comment I see all the time against Touch ID - \"Touch ID was terrible because if you were wearing gloves or your finger was wet, it wouldn't work!\"  BUT... Face ID still requires the swipe up, can't have your finger wet or be wearing gloves for that either!  As a modern uptake of Rest Finger to Open, I've always argued that Face ID should have a similar <em>option</em>.  Wake &gt; Authenticate &gt; Home, no swiping.  Just blow by the notifications.  Just a personal preference there.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The Notch</strong>. \u00a0Let's be honest, we have dealt with it, we have gotten used to it, but it is unsightly.  This isn't a required problem of Face ID, Apple could just go straight across and never allow for the notch to interfere, but still, here we are.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Apple Pay</strong>. \u00a0This is nit picky but bear with me.  When Apple Pay was first rolling out, if you held your phone near the POS terminal, the phone would wake asking for authentication to pay, then you could just rest your finger on Touch ID and the transaction was done. \u00a0No need to shift your finger to the awkward double click of apple pay now which might very well trigger a screen shot as the ergonomics of the phone requires some workaround to avoid the volume buttons when squeezing the power button twice. \u00a0The wake screen still works when holding it near the POS terminal now, but then once woken, you have to double click and authenticate with face id which requires you to move the phone away from the terminal unless the terminal is somewhat near head level, which it never is. \u00a0So, the best way with Face ID, is to double click the power button prior to getting the phone near the terminal and authenticating, then putting the phone at the terminal to pay. \u00a0It is an awkward order of events compared to Touch ID which was just hold near terminal and rest finger on the touch id... that was it. \u00a0So nice. \u00a0Granted, I think the Apple Watch would be king of Apple Pay if it didn't require the double click but at least authentication isn't necessary since it is already on your wrist and unlocked. \u00a0But the best apple pay experience was easily Touch ID with the terminal waking the phone and authentication occurring while your finger was resting on Touch ID. \u00a0So seamless. \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Sun Glasses</strong>. \u00a0Polarized sun glasses don't work with Face ID if you have the setting on that requires attention (eyes open). \u00a0I like my sun glasses polarized as I hate glare and spend a decent bit of time on the water.  But I also like the stronger privacy setting of requiring attention.  Ugh.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Unintentional Wake and Lock</strong>. \u00a0What happens pretty often is I will wake my phone and be looking at it while it is on a flat surface just to look at a notification or even just the time. \u00a0Face ID attempts to authenticate because my head is somewhat in view but due to the off angle, the authentication fails. \u00a0I don't notice this because I am just looking at a notification, but what ends up happening is I do this several times in a row then Face ID shuts down and I have to enter my passcode when I finally end up wanting to go to my home screen. \u00a0The crazy thing is, this is what happened when Face ID was first debuted to the public at whichever Keynote it was introduced. \u00a0Other presenters had stood in front of the new Face ID phone and the phone tried to authenticate the wrong person enough times that when Federighi got up there, it required the passcode again after several \"failed\" attempts which were really just the phone trying to authenticate at the wrong time (just like when my phone is on a flat surface).  This last one happens several times daily to me and I find it insanely frustrating.  </p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>The best would be a combination of both, and I think most would agree.  Double up that security for unlocking with either both or one.  Unlocking with touch id I still think is superior but then for in phone usage such as passwords, apps, auto-fill, etc. Face ID is better.  </p>\n<p>Lastly, I understand there are varying levels of care for such a small thing when arguably my issues above are small and whiny, but we all unlock our iPhones probably 100s of times a day and the above mentioned processes can diminish the experience.  Just my two cents as to why Touch ID still has strong merits in 2021.</p>\n<p>Fire back your thoughts!</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>I'm generally prone to losing things, but I actually hadn't lost my wallet in a couple of years. I was overdue. I was on my way back from my first concert since the pandemic started, it ended in Bushwick around 4am and then I had to walk 30 minutes to the Metropolitan G (there weren't any Ubers out at that time). By then, I was barely alive, and my wallet must have slipped out of my pocket into the train sometime between 4:30-5:30am. Most of the time if you lose your wallet on the subway, your chances of getting it back are so slim you don't even try, but I had luck, a kind stranger, and airtags on my side.</p>\n<p>I got up the next day around 1pm, so quite some time had passed since the wallet slipped out. I wasn't actually aware until I was about to leave the apartment with my girlfriend (her name is Ashley) to go to a friend's BBQ. I pulled up the Find My app and saw that it was all the way at Church ave. Suspicions confirmed, Church ave is the last stop on the G. I was worried that the wallet was still on a moving subway and I\u2019d have to track it down en route, but I saw it was at Church ave 15 min ago, and 10 minute later there was another update that showed it was still there.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://willliu.com/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Fc75d6999-904c-4b7c-817b-bf2ec772c446%2FIMG_9551.png?table=block&amp;id=c0af4a3c-515f-4eec-86cc-ee80d77a1be6&amp;spaceId=d7c01436-0d32-43ee-b215-3b2e9c2492a6&amp;width=580&amp;userId=&amp;cache=v2\">A screenshot of the Find My app telling me my wallet was at the last stop on the G train</a></p>\n<p>We run out and get on the Church bound G right away. We get all the way to the station and immediately go to the booth. The lady at the booth says she hasn\u2019t gotten a wallet. We re-surface to try to get another reading, and see that it's closer to the entrance at the end of the block. We head over and down, but there\u2019s no booth at this side of the station. However, there were some cops nearby and a door that leads to some of the MTA employee spaces. I asked them if I could get in there to ask around, and luckily an MTA guy showed up right then and they brought me in. They took me into a staff breakroom and asked around. No one had seen the wallet, and precision find wasn\u2019t activating even though we were right where the app said it was. One of the guy tells me that it\u2019s probably down in the dispatchers office, which was right underneath us.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/66b04325-0ce4-4815-b111-aa5ea409be59/ezgif-3-aa4196d25407.gif?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45O3KS52Y5%2F20210719%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20210719T155330Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=86400&amp;X-Amz-Signature=ba9f4793895a7d3122814eaa21ca72da068bf84fc0c4ebef9789eaa95f9f92fe&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\">My girlfriend recorded me coming out of the MTA office with the cop and MTA guy lol</a></p>\n<p>We head down the stairs and precision find activates! It starts pointing us right to the booth. I\u2019m getting really excited at this point, I really needed my wallet because we were traveling at the end of the week. <a href=\"https://willliu.com/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Fa91b3942-3b24-4762-ad66-441b424e1b62%2F588FED4B-241F-4111-AB02-525CC49793D3_1_105_c.jpeg?table=block&amp;id=c282457b-85bf-472b-8e18-de2462666e0d&amp;spaceId=d7c01436-0d32-43ee-b215-3b2e9c2492a6&amp;width=2050&amp;userId=&amp;cache=v2\">We knock on the door and ask the lady inside about a wallet</a>. She says she hasn\u2019t seen or heard about no wallet and shrugs us off. She really didn't want to deal with us and she seemed pretty sure that a wallet did not get turned in.</p>\n<p>But we\u2019re SO close, I know the wallet is somewhere around so I keep pushing. I show her the arrow on my phone and tell her that the arrow would lead to the phone. She takes my phone, and goes back inside the office. We can see precision finding guiding her around the office, until it takes her to a drawer, which she opens. To her disbelief, my wallet is there!</p>\n<p>The best part about this was the surprise and excitement that lady had. She kept asking me, \u201cHow did you do that??\u201d \u201cWhat is that thing?\u201d. \u201cThat was so cool!!!\u201d. I was really happy to get it back of course, but seeing her in awe of this tech really made me feel proud to live that Apple ecosystem life.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://willliu.com/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F7ab259ad-d7bd-44f8-86fa-4c74216e0ee9%2F60908632-3212-4CB3-AE74-3946823F331F_1_105_c.jpeg?table=block&amp;id=ec25f3d1-f57d-40c0-9c11-483bd0f3390e&amp;spaceId=d7c01436-0d32-43ee-b215-3b2e9c2492a6&amp;width=2050&amp;userId=&amp;cache=v2\">Got my wallet back!</a></p>\n<p>I\u2019m so thankful I tagged my wallet, and really impressed with how the tech worked out for me in a real life situation. If I didn\u2019t have the tag, there\u2019s no way I would have gotten that wallet back. I could have wandered down to the dispatchers office, talked to the same lady, and definitely would not have gotten the wallet back even if I was 20 feet away from it. Lately, tech has been moving so fast that I have built in expectations around improvements. It's been some time since I've used some tech that has really wowed me and given me that holy-shit-this-is-the-future feeling. What's really impressive is how a simple and cheap device can tie into the existing ecosystem and integrate with the other devices to create a practical and powerful experience for users.</p>\n<p>This post is dedicated to the kind stranger who turned my wallet in without taking anything inside of it!</p>",

But I also love the idea of using Apple Music to stay in the \"Apple Ecosystem\", so I've tried the free trial to see what I thought. </p>\n<p>I know there are people on here that eco similar thoughts of the UI and overall usability of Apple Music lacking compared to Spotify, but I haven't seen anyone list out all the small things that make it hard to make the switch. There are obvious missing huge features like Spotify Connect. But there are so many small gripes I have with their desktop player that make it really hard for me to justify switching over:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Not clear what is album vs a playlist in AM. Spotify is better at making playlist artwork that stands apart</li>\n<li>AM is slow. Whenever a new page is loading it takes a good second to load the information on the page. I'm not sure why this is. </li>\n<li>Annoying to switch between mini player and big player in AM</li>\n<li>Cant click artist name or song name in mini player</li>\n<li>AM search results are lacking in depth and ease of navigation after something is searched.</li>\n<li>When AM is quit, and opened again, it does not remember what you were last listening to</li>\n<li>CMD + S does not enable shuffle</li>\n<li>Artists top songs do not show number of plays</li>\n<li>When an album has music videos at the end, it automatically plays them when the album reaches that point and plays them in full screen</li>\n<li>Cant find public playlists, only apple generated ones</li>\n<li>Clicking song name on a song in a playlist does not take you to the album</li>\n<li>Playlists you create don\u2019t have the artists name or album clickable, need to right click and \u201cshow on Apple Music\u201d</li>\n<li>Cant preview a stations songs by clicking on the album art, have to click play to start playing the station and get a list of songs</li>\n</ul>",
