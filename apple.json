The idea of the app is to show you the weather you will encounter along your route, exactly at the time you will be driving through. Thanks to reddit and especially beta testers from r/apple it's been a great success, with over 140k downloads at the moment (and it even reached #3 in the US weather charts).</p>\n<p>The one thing that everyone has been asking for from the day 0 has been CarPlay. I have started working on it soon after getting the initial version done but it's been a real challenge. Apple's guidelines are very strict on it, requiring the app to fit into very specific categories, with different technical capabilities reserved for each of these categories. There are also many limitations, both technical and approval based.</p>\n<p>However,  I'm happy to let you know that Apple has approved the app's latest update, which adds CarPlay support with the following features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Precipitation Weather Radar - the CarPlay screen shows live map with precipitation radar, updated every 10 minutes. Since they do not allow for animation, the radar instead displays direction arrows to indicate how a storm moves. It includes both rain and snow.</li>\n<li>Weather on the route - like on the phone, the CarPlay displays the route you select, along with temperature and weather for points along the route. The times are predicted to be exactly when you will be driving through them and it adjusts every minute based on your current location, so if you make a stop, the times will adjust.</li>\n<li>National Weather Service and other government weather alerts along the route - it shows all the alerts (updated every 10 minutes) on the CarPlay display and how many miles until you reach them.</li>\n<li>Turn-By-Turn navigation - A simple navigation system, showing upcoming manoeuvres. Some features are still coming soon for this, like rerouting or directions spoken out-loud.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One thing I would like to mention that unfortunately, because of the amount of expensive weather data needed, I cannot offer these features on the free tier. It's part of PRO, with monthly and yearly subscriptions ($4.99 and $24.99 respectively) and lifetime option for people who hate subscriptions.</p>\n<p>But I also wanted to make sure that everyone can try the features and see for themselves if they are worth it, so there is a one week free trial on the yearly tier and additionally you get PRO for free on your first 5 trips without committing to any subscriptions.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e7111d2730ed769354a84fd/637268ef62aac4ee7f7797e6_photo.jpg\">Here is how it looks like on the CarPlay system</a></p>\n<p>You can try the app for yourself here:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1471394318\">https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1471394318</a></p>\n<p>I would really appreciate your feedback and suggestions!</p></div>",

It's a free alternative to the official app, built specifically for iOS (almost like if Apple created their own Reddit app), with lots of customizability, and being built in the open with community feedback. </p>\n<p>I worked my butt off this summer so you'd have a Reddit app with all the best iOS 16 features on day 1:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A ton of awesome Lock Screen Widgets for Reddit, so you can keep tabs on your favorite subreddits, or how your posts are doing, total distance scrolled, etc. right from your lock screen</li>\n<li>Live Text analysis, similar so the Photos app you can now directly select, share, and translate text just by selecting text in pics and videos in Apollo</li>\n<li>Subreddit weather for hundreds of subreddits, so when you go to one you can see the weather there, as well as the local time!</li>\n<li>Scroll Distance Tracker, so as you use Apollo you get live stats on how many miles you've scrolled in total, synced between all your devices, with comparisons to common distances like the height of Mount Everest, or 48 Shaquille O'Neals, and you can even set distance goals like a true athlete!</li>\n<li>Pixel Pals, so if you have an iPhone 14 Pro, you can have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChristianSelig/status/1570863225234923520\">a little Tamagotchi-style buddy above the Dynamic Island</a> while you browse Reddit, and even if you don't have the newest iPhone, you can pin them to your Lock Screen as a widget!</li>\n<li>More fun Dynamic Island stuff to come!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Really proud of this update, so to celebrate it I wanted to do like I've done in the past, and have an iPhone 14 Pro giveaway! Just leave a comment (no spam pls) and you're entered, and I'll draw the winner in 24 hours.</p>\n<p>Pic: https://i.imgur.com/dXBe07S.jpg</p>\n<p>Unsure what to comment?

For a company that touts having polished products and services, Siri fails to meet that level, and it is embarrassing. Google Assistant and Alexa run laps around her. There\u2019s so many issues, from basic voice recognition and understanding what I\u2019m saying to it not being able to do even a third of what rival voice assistants can do. She does nothing particularly well. I find myself visibly frustrated with her screwing up  basic core commands or not understanding basic sentences. She can\u2019t even execute core functions adequately. Today, I asked her to remind me to get a COVID booster Friday, and instead of putting a reminder down for that, she pulls up web results for COVID boosters. I had a Galaxy Note 9 for a while, and Google Assistant puts Siri to shame and it\u2019s the one thing I do miss from my brief flirtation with android. </p>\n<p>Apple needs to fix Siri. This is not a quality product and it honestly doesn\u2019t meet Apple\u2019s reputation of polish and quality. Siri sucks. Flat out. She does not meet the level of quality Apple has staked it\u2019s reputation on. If this company is serious about making a play into the smart home with HomePod and other third party accessories that are being shipped with Siri, then Siri MUST be fixed, or Apple will fail in making itself a player in the smarthome arena. The fact that Siri was a pioneer in the Voice Assistant arena, and then was allowed to languish and be lapped by rivals is unacceptable.</p></div>",
