The software optimization they used has clearly been swept under the rug at the expense of albeit very handy new features; my iPhone 8 can't keep anything in the background for the life of it.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the iPhone X (3 GB of RAM) that I temporarily have in my possession performs considerably better with the extra gig. It can open the camera without a stutter and it keeps apps open in the background much more adequately than my iPhone 8. </p>\n<p>My point: It wasn't a good idea to put such a small amount of RAM in a phone that expensive, and it definitely would have benefitted from an extra gig or so down the road.</p>\n<p>Rant over</p></div>",

I frequently participate in a ride called \u201cRagbrai\u201d which involves cycling 500ish miles in a week so I have a rather expensive bike. Today I rode to my classes and then after leaving one of the buildings I found that my bike was stolen and the <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/ZU4tWTQ.jpg\">lock</a> cut right through. I immediately checked the Find My app to see if hopefully the <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/5VlgeLq.jpg\">AirTag</a> I had hidden under the seat would be able to tell me where my bike had gone. I saw that it was around 5 minutes walking distance north of me on campus and figured that whoever had stolen it must\u2019ve just left with the bike. I tried running to catch them but they started cycling on a major <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/IHboiLA.jpg\">road</a> in town so I gave up trying to catch them and just called the campus police. I was able to update them with the location of the bike every couple of minutes as it was pinging off of the assailant\u2019s phone and they were able to find <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/oriXGkZ.jpg\">him</a> and arrest him for grand theft. I thankfully got my bike back which wouldn\u2019t have happened without my AirTag :)</p></div>",

It appears mine might be an error but it\u2019s weird to see on my return email. </p>\n<p>Located in USA. Ordered a 13 pro leather case yesterday (meant to order max). One minute after my order I tried to cancel but got the message to wait a few hours before I could make changes. Kept refreshing until it said preparing for shipment and canceling was no longer an option. Contacted apple and they sent a request to cancel on their end. Got a notice a bit later saying it shipped. </p>\n<p>Just got an email saying they\u2019ve initiated my return but I\u2019m going to be charged a $5.90 re-stocking fee (10%). Don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen this before so be aware. Wonder if they do the same on phones, which would be $110 for a Pro Max!</p></div>",

I love Apple, so it's a shame I have to go outside its ecosystem to do this.</p>\n<h1>Explanation</h1>\n<p>I drive around 130 miles a day and, during driving, I like to make progress on an ebook through audio.  Whenever I stop driving, I prefer to continue the book by switching to the text version.  This way I go through more books. With Libby, an app that allows me to check out audiobooks from my public library, I can transition from text to audio by first having to finish the chapter on text then looking up the next chapter in the audiobook version.  To transition back to text after I'm done driving, I can listen to the last phrase of the audio and search for it on the text version to find my place.  I used to wonder, \"if only there was an app that did this seamlessly.\"  </p>\n<p>For my next book, Foundation by Asimov, I purchased the Apple Books audiobook to try it out.  It was hideously worse because instead of a normal chapter index, it was arranged by 152 \"tracks\".  I could no longer transition from where I was reading the text to the corresponding new chapter in the Audio because all I had was a list of tracks.  The free audiobook from my public library was more useful because it was indexed by chapters.</p>\n<p>Currently I had been reading I, Robot on text only in Kindle, had made some progress since a week ago when I got it.  Then today I got an Amazon Prime membership and found the audiobook available in Audible.  I clicked play.  My mind was blown.  It seamlessly picked up where I had left off in the Kindle text version!  Going back to the text will also automatically take me to where I left off during my audio part.  I no longer have to search for my place when transitioning from text to audio and back.  Unfortunately, though, this is not available within Apple Books, it is only available on Amazon Kindle and Audible.  I like staying within Apple whenever possible so it's a let down.</p>\n<p>Edit: I don\u2019t own a kindle device. I meant I use the kindle app on iOS and MacOS.</p></div>",

Especially to the Z Flip or the Fold 3. Those being the gimmicky phones isn't the only reason I'm thinking about moving back, as there are some other software things that I prefer on Android.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Back Button:</strong> After a year, I still miss the back button on Android. I thought I would get over it, but I didn't. I was playing around with my old Galaxy S10e and I went back to using the back button instantly, there was no gesture habit to break or re-learning of Android UI.</li>\n<li><strong>SD Card/Storage:</strong> I miss the SD card or larger cheap built in storage. Even Android mgfs are getting rid of SD cards, but there are still some that offer it.</li>\n<li><strong>Locked experience:</strong> I never got used to the locked ecosystem, I like to Side load apps that aren't available or are restricted by geographical location. For example Hulu. I could easily side load it on Android and use a VPN, whereas on Apple, it requires way more steps by changing apple ID's location then logging into the US app store etc. Too much of a hassle.</li>\n<li><strong>Face ID:</strong> It was ok, but they need to introduce touchID to complement the FaceID. Between the two, I would prefer the Fingerprint sensor. I know some diehard fans who prefer faceID bar none. Masks didn't help with the Face ID this year. And I heard some rumors that Apple might have improved faceID enabling it to work with Masks on iPhone 13. I guess we'll see, but Apple, why not leave your stubbornness behind and just introduce TouchID, either under the display or in the power button.</li>\n<li><strong>Widgets:</strong> I'm really glad they introduced widgets, but they have a long way to go to catch up to Android. I still could never find the proper widget that took up half of one of the home screens, that displayed a full month calendar, like this: <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/lBP3QUG.jpeg\">https://i.imgur.com/lBP3QUG.jpeg</a></li>\n<li><strong>No Airdrop Alternative:</strong> I'm a Windows user, and I searched for an Airdrop alternative that would work on Windows, but couldn't come up with anything. I used to use pushbullet, where I could right click on an image on a webpage and click \"send to the phone\" using pushbullet and it would download on the phone right away. Pushbullet took their app off the app store because Apple required them to use appleID for logging in or something like that.</li>\n<li><strong>Keyboard:</strong> I don't know what it is, but I make way more errors while typing on iPhone than I did with Android. I thought maybe it was the screen size, but my S10e was roughly the same size as the iPhone 11 Pro. I use Gboard on both, but apparently Gboard is severely crippled on the iPhone. I remember when Gboard was released on iOS before Android, I was so jealous, because the Samsung keyboard used to suck. The Gboard appears and behaves differently on iOS compared to Android.</li>\n<li><strong>Always On Display &amp; Notifications:</strong> I really miss the Android notifications, Apple's notifications have vastly improved but nowhere near Android level. The way they are displayed and grouped on Android is way better than iOS. I do see that Apple made some improvements to notifications in iOS15. And in addition to that the AOD was awesome. I used to have the notification LED on earlier Samsungs till they switched to AOD. Now with the iPhone being an OLED display, why hasn't Apple adopted this yet?</li>\n<li><strong>Transferring files and photos:</strong> This is what pissed me off yesterday. My phone ran out of space so I couldn't send any attachments so I thought I'd plug the phone into my laptop and transfer all the pictures and videos to my HDD. Apparently Apple doesn't store pictures and videos in the DCIM folder anymore, they're embedded somewhere. So my only option was to use iCloud to sync photos onto my laptop or download each one or thousand at a time from <a href=\"https://icloud.com\">icloud.com</a>.</li>\n<li>BUT, they weren't even full resolution, even when I clicked to download the unmodified original. Anyways, the main issue was that I had to download almost 10GB worth of media from icloud which essentially eats up my data and my internet speed is only 5-10mbps (waiting for Starlink). I tried looking for other ways to get the photos and videos out of my phone, but nothing worked. Bought AnyTrans software for like $100 and it only pulled 60 photos from the phone then told me that the rest of the images are on the cloud. Tried to use Microsoft photo transfer and the same thing, it only got 60 pictures as well. Now I need to go somewhere else with fast LTE or wifi and download the media so I can delete them and clear up some space. And if they are stored on iCloud only, then why is my storage showing its full?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>No Libraries and file system:</strong> All the photos end up in one library and the file system in general sucks. The Android file system is years ahead.</li>\n<li><strong>Design and features:</strong> The design is outdated, 60hz screen and big notch. It is common knowledge that Apple likes to polish everything before releasing, whereas Android Mfgs can release more experimental features like folding screens, under display cameras and fingerprint sensors. But it seems Apple has been taking longer and longer to polish stuff. I'll come back to Apple, once they release a phone with everything under the display and the front is just a screen, and there is no port lol. I guess we will see if the iPhone 13 has a higher refresh rate screen and sports a smaller notch.</li>\n<li><strong>No USB-C:</strong> I have a lot of USB-C cables around but I had to invest into buying Lightning to USB-C cables and leave them in a few places, so I always had them where I needed them. Still, as even apple fans agree, Lightning needs to go, and they need to bring usb-c to the iPhone instead of ditching the lightning for no port and relying on mag-safe.</li>\n<li><strong>Apple invading your privacy to protect the children:</strong> It was really cool when Apple came out with a policy that required all the apps to ask if they could track the users. Facebook, Instagram and likes were losing their shit because they couldn't target ads anymore.</li>\n<li>But now Apple wants to scan people's shit to look for child porn? That's cool but I don't think they'll stop there. Apple is scummy to use the children as an excuse to force their way into people's shit. Apple made it so that if you are against this, then you are probably a pedo who doesn't want apple looking at their pictures, or you probably enable child predators. Fuck all that, I want predators caught, but I also don't want apple to scan my stuff. They better spend billions of dollars and create a think tank to figure out a way around this invasion of privacy.</li>\n<li><strong>Apple the industry trendsetter:</strong> It's a shame that the industry uses Apple as the leader and adopts whatever revenue generating trends it sets. Such as ditching the headphone jack to sell bluetooth headphones, expensive phone storage to sell cloud storage, Ditching the power brick to go \"green\" and save the environment. It certainly wasn't to sell the power brick as a marked-up accessory, nope. It was to save the environment by making the iPhone packaging smaller meanwhile the power brick came in its own unnecessary packaging.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Things I will miss if I move back to Android:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Air tags:</strong> I like these little things, I have easily found my wallet and keys with the iPhone and tags</li>\n<li><strong>Seamless Sync:</strong> It seems the iPhone connects to other things easily without much input or steps.</li>\n<li><strong>Blue imessage text bubbles</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Apple Pay</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I switched to iOS from Android, because I was bored and wanted to try out the iPhone and see what had changed from when I used to have my 3GS. A year was a good break from Android and gave me some perspective of iOS users.</p>\n<p>So I'm going to wait and see what Improvements the 13 has and see if it has solved some of my issues. If it is relatively unchanged then I'll be looking for a new Galaxy phone or maybe try a different Android phone.</p></div>",

I had a lot of heated debates with Oxford about Mac related stuff... the IBM world, Apple Xserve, etc...</p>\n<p>He was pretty much the guy who knew everything about Apple.\nAfter we discussed the industry and debated IT philosophy for a few years, I had an occasion to email with him, he sent me an email from the address of \"Ichangedtheworld@mac.com\".</p>\n<p>Any time in my work if I came across Apple being used in an infrastructure, he was always there to help me out. We never met in person, but we would talk via email a few times a year.</p>\n<p>Then one day he was gone. The emails still don't bounce, but there is never a reply.\nMy wife is convinced that my nemesis/friend was Steve Jobs, it was around the time of him getting sick that Oxford dropped out of contact.</p>\n<p>Does anybody remember Oxford, or know of him? I would like to know, or perhaps get back in touch with my old friend.</p>\n<p>I know it's a long shot, but I am getting old now and would love to hear from him.</p></div>",
