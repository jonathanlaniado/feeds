I was nowhere near that store in that moment, nevermind that whole day. I went through text support that night, which led to voice support on Sunday. The lady couldn\u2019t believe it either. They told me they\u2019d escalate the matter and that they\u2019d call me the next 2 business days and that they\u2019d take care of me.</p>\n<p>Today I got the call from Apple support, and they told me that my options were to file a police report and have my credit card company refund the transactions. Was a bit peeved at this response, being that it sounded like they won\u2019t investigate this matter at all until the police get involved. The only nice thing is they helped connect with my Apple Card company rep so I could do it straight away.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve never heard of this happen, and the lady herself mentioned she only had calls where people couldn\u2019t get their own phones because they were too strict. Anyone ever hear of this happening?</p>\n<p>Either it was a deliberate identity fraud/theft situation, or the employee accidentally gave my phone away to someone else and kept their order unchecked. At least I have the information regarding which employee handed off my iPhone.</p></div>",

The battery of the 13 mini is such a big upgrade when compared to the 6s.</p>\n<p>After a whole day work, my battery was still holding at 70%. Then I got to charge it on my comute (30 min by car) back to 90%.</p>\n<p>Went to the gym, listened to music the whole time with screen showing lyrics at high brightness. Got back home, watched videos, played some games from apple arcade and the battery is still at 67%.</p>\n<p>This all would be impossible with my 6s.</p>\n<p>TLDR.: I just people out there to know, that if you have an iPhone 6s and want to upgrade to a 13 mini, then you would probably be very happy with its battery performance.</p></div>",

Until now that's been very tricky with just the link to go off of, but with iOS 15 Apple added Safari extensions which allow you to do more with intercepting these pages directly, so I built an app/extension to block AMP pages.</p>\n<p>I'm calling it Amplosion. It's private, with everything happening on-device and it's <a href=\"https://github.com/christianselig/Amplosion\">open source</a> to prove it. And today for Reddit, I knocked 33% off the already low price to make it just $2.</p>\n<p>For some extra fun, it includes a Tamagotchi style dog named that lives in the Settings screen for you to play with. His name is Lord Waffles and he's very cute. \ud83d\udc36</p>\n<h1>AMP pages? Huh?</h1>\n<p>For the uninitiated, AMP pages are a project Google makes where they basically re-host the webpage with the claimed goal of trying to make it load faster.</p>\n<p>The reality is that it often creates an inconsistent, or <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/gPIhe7x.mp4\">often outright broken experience</a>, that then mangles the URL for sharing with people by making it three times as long with a bunch of Google junk added. It also adds more ways <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/wbCQXoV.png\">for Google to track you</a>.</p>\n<p>Here's another <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/01/17/schreiber-amp\">article by Daring Fireball</a> on AMP's annoyingness.</p>\n<h1>Delightful</h1>\n<p>Blocking AMP pages from your life is very delightful in and of itself, but I wanted the app to go above and beyond to be even more delightful. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>A beautiful 3D flip counter at the top that counts how many AMP articles it's blocked</li>\n<li>Can show you a breakdown of how many times it's activated for specific sites</li>\n<li>Customizable, allowing you to enable AMP for specific websites if you so choose</li>\n<li>As mentioned, everything happens on-device and is open source for transparency</li>\n<li>In addition to having a loving dog, it has a short story about his adventures with his friend who is a turtle</li>\n<li>Awesome widgets, so you can see your total Amplosions on your home screen (or the status of Lord Waffles)</li>\n<li>Gorgeous, included <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/xdMm6As.png\">customizable home screen icons</a> by Matthew Skiles</li>\n<li>No ads, subscriptions, in-app purchases, or funny business. Just pay $2 and enjoy it all. :)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I really, really hope you like the app. It's been such a breath of fresh air to be using for the last few months and I'd love any feedback/input you have. I'll hang around here as long as you want if you have any questions so feel free to AMA me as well haha.</p>\n<p>Download link: https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1585734696</p></div>",

I even believe that it could compete with the expensive scanner apps out there. But you'll be the judge of that. Anyway, it's still free, without any ads and without any data collection. Everything happens on your device.</p>\n<p>The <strong>key features</strong> are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Scan with your camera (with automatic edges detection and automatic angle correction)</li>\n<li>Import existing PDF (from Files) or existing photos (from Camera Roll). You can even combine them (also with scans) into one document. You can also reorder the pages with a nicely animated Drag &amp; Drop.</li>\n<li><strong>Scan history</strong>: the app keeps (on device) a list of your previous scans such that they remain available for whenever you need them.</li>\n<li><strong>Recognize text (OCR)</strong> on anything (scans / photos / PDF)</li>\n<li><strong>Integrate the recognized text into the exported PDF</strong> such that it becomes searchable (search/select/copy &amp; paste). Yes!!</li>\n<li>Export to .TXT (text), .JPG (images), or to searchable .PDF (as detailed previously)</li>\n<li><strong>Automatic file naming</strong>: configure a pattern with date/time/text that suits your needs, and your scans will be named accordingly</li>\n<li>Apply filters (colors, grayscale, B&amp;W, size, compression) on images and instantly preview the output file size</li>\n<li>Preview the OCR results and copy them to the pasteboard</li>\n<li>Configure a <strong>default save location</strong>, such that when you export the scan, it directly saves it in the configured folder</li>\n<li>Configure the PDF print size (A4, US Letter, ...)</li>\n<li>Shortcut on the homescreen app icon to immediately initiate a scan</li>\n<li>Everything happens locally, on your device. No server. Your data is safe and your privacy matters.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I hope you like the app, and that it will continue to reach the people in-need for a free scanner for their studies/work/whatever. The in-app purchase is a simple tip jar, for the people who can afford to support the project \u263a\ufe0f.</p>\n<p>Your feedback is VERY welcome, I'd love to continue improving the app based on your amazing suggestions.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/id1513790291\">Link to QuickScan v4 on the App Store</a></p>\n<p>Thank you!</p></div>",

The software optimization they used has clearly been swept under the rug at the expense of albeit very handy new features; my iPhone 8 can't keep anything in the background for the life of it.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the iPhone X (3 GB of RAM) that I temporarily have in my possession performs considerably better with the extra gig. It can open the camera without a stutter and it keeps apps open in the background much more adequately than my iPhone 8. </p>\n<p>My point: It wasn't a good idea to put such a small amount of RAM in a phone that expensive, and it definitely would have benefitted from an extra gig or so down the road.</p>\n<p>Rant over</p></div>",

I frequently participate in a ride called \u201cRagbrai\u201d which involves cycling 500ish miles in a week so I have a rather expensive bike. Today I rode to my classes and then after leaving one of the buildings I found that my bike was stolen and the <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/ZU4tWTQ.jpg\">lock</a> cut right through. I immediately checked the Find My app to see if hopefully the <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/5VlgeLq.jpg\">AirTag</a> I had hidden under the seat would be able to tell me where my bike had gone. I saw that it was around 5 minutes walking distance north of me on campus and figured that whoever had stolen it must\u2019ve just left with the bike. I tried running to catch them but they started cycling on a major <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/IHboiLA.jpg\">road</a> in town so I gave up trying to catch them and just called the campus police. I was able to update them with the location of the bike every couple of minutes as it was pinging off of the assailant\u2019s phone and they were able to find <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/oriXGkZ.jpg\">him</a> and arrest him for grand theft. I thankfully got my bike back which wouldn\u2019t have happened without my AirTag :)</p></div>",
