            "content_html": "<p>The U.S. has officially imposed 10% tariffs on Chinese imports, which could significantly affect Apple products. With much of Apple\u2019s supply chain still based in China, this raises questions about whether we\u2019ll see higher prices on iPhones, Macs, and other Apple devices.</p>\n<p>In the past, Apple successfully secured tariff waivers under Trump\u2019s administration, but given the current political climate, it\u2019s unclear if they\u2019ll be able to do that again. Tim Cook has historically worked to maintain strong ties with government officials\u2014including attending Trump\u2019s inauguration\u2014but Apple\u2019s DEI initiatives could still make them a target. Trump has already taken action against companies with DEI policies, so could this put Apple in the crosshairs?</p>\n<p>A few questions for the community:</p>\n<p>Do you think Apple will absorb the tariff costs, or will we see price hikes? </p>\n<p>Is there a chance Apple secures another waiver, or is this the time they get hit? </p>\n<p>Could Apple\u2019s focus on DEI make them more of a target, even after Tim Cook\u2019s efforts to stay in good standing with the administration?</p>",

No internet required, and no data collected.</p>\n<p>All in-app purchases are one-time and exist only to expand the scope of the game, if desired. No GACHA, randomized, or consumable purchases of any kind.</p>\n<p><strong>Disc Brick</strong> is a simple but aesthetic and robust brick breaker. A great small time waster with detailed visuals and haptics. Published originally in 2019 to amazing response here on Reddit, the game was updated with improved graphics, additional power-ups, and more themes and game modes, all without compromising on the original promise of a game free of ads and unethical monetization practices. My goal was to make a version of this simple game mechanic that anyone or their kids could enjoy indefinitely.</p>\n<p><strong>melod</strong> is a music/rhythm game, similar to Guitar Hero or Rock Band. The free setlist is fairly large (over an hour of music) and consists of music from a variety of very talented indie artists who collaborated with me. A series of additional songs of increasing difficulty can be purchased if desired. This game retains the classic feel of those older rhythm games by allowing you to play \"melody\" or \"rhythm\"\u2014built with multi-track stems so when you miss notes, your instrument drops out. It even has some songs I wrote and produced myself! All music is high-quality and enjoyable. You'll probably find some new artists you like!</p>\n<p>Honestly, I have been super happy with the positive response I've gotten from on these games. I would love to continue making games with these ideals to resist the mobile gaming trend of aggressive consumable IAPs.</p>",

It's a 1:1 copy of the Dynamic Island for your iPhone, but now on your Mac. It shows you low battery alerts for both your Mac and your AirPods, it will show you that sweet 3D animation of AirPods when you're connecting them, as well as the battery level. It will let you know when you've entered focus mode. It also replaces your native HUD to better match the one on iOS.</p>\n<p>It fully replicates the media controls in the Dynamic Island on iOS. It even runs on your lock screen showing a little lock icon, just as you're already familiar with on your iPhone.</p>\n<p>I put an immense amount of time to ensure that the app would feel incredibly smooth and fluid, just as the original. I believe I truly achieved it, it's something that you need to try to really get a feel for it.</p>\n<p>There's a lot of features already in Alcove, many more are coming. This is just the beginning for the app. I hope you do enjoy it as much as I do, I generally create apps for myself to begin with.</p>\n<p>Please do check it out at\u00a0<a href=\"https://tryalcove.com/\">tryalcove.com</a>, where there is an interactive demo. It also has a trial, so you can completely decide if this is something for you.</p>",

I\u2019m excited to share\u00a0<a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/id1636166205\">Feelly</a>, a simple, friendly app to help you tune into your moods, find patterns, and add a bit of mindfulness to your day. \ud83d\ude0a</p>\n<p><strong>What Feelly offers</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mood Tracking</strong>: Log how you\u2019re feeling \u2013 happy, love, stressed, or anything in between.</li>\n<li><strong>Mindfulness &amp; Breathing</strong>: It includes guided breathing sessions like the\u00a0<strong>4-7-8 technique</strong>\u00a0(inhale, hold, exhale) that\u2019s known to calm the mind. Personally, I found I preferred a different rhythm (4-5-5) and realized everyone has their own comfortable breath pattern, so I added a settings feature where you can\u00a0<strong>customize the breathing duration</strong>\u00a0to suit you. \ud83c\udf2c\ufe0f</li>\n<li><strong>A Friendly Chat Option</strong>: Ever feel like talking things out when you\u2019re down?
