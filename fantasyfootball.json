            "content_html": "<p>as the title says. As fantasy football players, we sometimes have players that we scratch off our list to draft for a variety of reasons. Whether that be anticipating regression, a change in team/coaching staff, the team drafting a rookie RB, etc. However, the draft day board sometimes doesn\u2019t fall your way and you have to do the \u201cughhh I guess I\u2019ll pick this guy\u201d with a begrudging attitude. Turns out that very same player can surprise you and produce at a rate you really weren\u2019t expecting. Who\u2019s that guy for you this year? </p>\n<p>My choice: easily James Cook. I was obsessed with leaving with Chase Brown in the 2nd round after going RB at the 1.03. Brown, Kyren, Jacobs, Bucky and Taylor were all gone by the time it was my turn to pick. So the choice was between Cook and Breece. Thankful so far that i went against my pre draft opinions and took a chance on who looks like a definitive RB1 rest of year.  </p>",

Henderson <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Fhqh9kbczhr7f1.jpeg\">struggled to force missed tackles on inside runs in college</a>, and the data isn't encouraging right now for him to take over the Patriots backfield, as the offseason consensus seems to point toward. </p>\n<p>Gibson seeing an increase role is definitely a bad thing. You don't want him even being part of the equation if you drafted Henderson. Gibson saw six opportunities in Week 2 to just two in Week 1. Of Henderson's 16 touches in Week 1, he forced just two missed tackles. I don't have the data for Week 2 yet, but his low MTF rate tracks with his struggles in college. At least when I analyzed the film, he often goes down after meaningful contact. </p>\n<p><strong>This is a very small sample size!!!</strong> The sample size is small. Does it mean the end of the world if you drafted Henderson? No. But things right now are trending in the wrong direction, and it's because Henderson hasn't done well in various areas of his game. He's obviously still the explosive athlete you saw returning the kickoff for the touchdown in the preseason. But that athleticism doesn't guarantee a backfield takeover. </p>\n<p>Moving forward, Rhamondre should have a prominent role at least for long at expected. The best case scenario is that Henderson takes over the backfield by midseason. Maybe if Stevenson fumbles a lot. The worst case scenario is that Henderson doesn't even keep the passing downs, which would be critical for his PPR upside. Him getting destroyed in pass pro and being responsible for at least two sacks in Week 2 won't help with that. And I don't think he has the between-the-tackle running chops to take that role either. </p>\n<p>The supposed prominent slot and split out wide receiving roles that he was expected to get haven't materialized either.</p>",
