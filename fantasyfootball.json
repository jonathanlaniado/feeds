            "content_html": "<p>The RB position is not purely about YPC. RBs also need to not cause negative plays; they need to be able to pass protect and limit run stuffs. </p>\n<p>Unless your favorite underused explosive RB starts getting a hell of a lot better at pass protection and not bouncing everything outside, he will continue being underused. </p>\n<p>Yes, this is about K9, but it also applies to Jaylen Warren when he was sharing with Najee, Swift when he was on the Lions, Y1 Bijan, Gibson on the WFT, Pollard on the Cowboys, etc etc. </p>\n<p>Don\u2019t expect RBs to get a heavier workload while being actively bad at 50% of their job, and you won\u2019t be disappointed. </p>\n<p>Expect that unless they improve, they will not fend off the backs who CAN pass protect and consistently grind out 1-2 yards instead of bounce for -5. </p>\n<p>TL;DR: they probably suck at pass blocking and/or bounce outside too much. </p>",

Turns out that very same player can surprise you and produce at a rate you really weren\u2019t expecting. Who\u2019s that guy for you this year? </p>\n<p>My choice: easily James Cook. I was obsessed with leaving with Chase Brown in the 2nd round after going RB at the 1.03. Brown, Kyren, Jacobs, Bucky and Taylor were all gone by the time it was my turn to pick. So the choice was between Cook and Breece. Thankful so far that i went against my pre draft opinions and took a chance on who looks like a definitive RB1 rest of year.  </p>",
