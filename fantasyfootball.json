Turns out that very same player can surprise you and produce at a rate you really weren\u2019t expecting. Who\u2019s that guy for you this year? </p>\n<p>My choice: easily James Cook. I was obsessed with leaving with Chase Brown in the 2nd round after going RB at the 1.03. Brown, Kyren, Jacobs, Bucky and Taylor were all gone by the time it was my turn to pick. So the choice was between Cook and Breece. Thankful so far that i went against my pre draft opinions and took a chance on who looks like a definitive RB1 rest of year.  </p>",

Henderson <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Fhqh9kbczhr7f1.jpeg\">struggled to force missed tackles on inside runs in college</a>, and the data isn't encouraging right now for him to take over the Patriots backfield, as the offseason consensus seems to point toward. </p>\n<p>Gibson seeing an increase role is definitely a bad thing. You don't want him even being part of the equation if you drafted Henderson. Gibson saw six opportunities in Week 2 to just two in Week 1. Of Henderson's 16 touches in Week 1, he forced just two missed tackles. I don't have the data for Week 2 yet, but his low MTF rate tracks with his struggles in college. At least when I analyzed the film, he often goes down after meaningful contact. </p>\n<p><strong>This is a very small sample size!!!</strong> The sample size is small. Does it mean the end of the world if you drafted Henderson? No. But things right now are trending in the wrong direction, and it's because Henderson hasn't done well in various areas of his game. He's obviously still the explosive athlete you saw returning the kickoff for the touchdown in the preseason. But that athleticism doesn't guarantee a backfield takeover. </p>\n<p>Moving forward, Rhamondre should have a prominent role at least for long at expected. The best case scenario is that Henderson takes over the backfield by midseason. Maybe if Stevenson fumbles a lot. The worst case scenario is that Henderson doesn't even keep the passing downs, which would be critical for his PPR upside. Him getting destroyed in pass pro and being responsible for at least two sacks in Week 2 won't help with that. And I don't think he has the between-the-tackle running chops to take that role either. </p>\n<p>The supposed prominent slot and split out wide receiving roles that he was expected to get haven't materialized either.</p>",

Although all charges were dropped a month later, the league is still looking into the matter, and his status for Week 2 remains uncertain after he missed practice following the meeting. Browns insider Ken Carman expects the NFL to hand down a heavy suspension, pointing to the league\u2019s desire to protect its image in the wake of past controversies like the Ray Rice case.

Conventional wisdom is that an offense can\u2019t support 2 TE1s, but if the Browns Week 1 is the base case, then it should be doable - ie they played far more 2TE sets than 3WR. So if Fannin is functionally a WR3, it should be possible to support 2 TEs.</p>\n<p>Week 2 will be crucial, but based on rankings, nobody is willing to stick their neck out yet! </p>",
