            "content_html": "<p>as the title says. As fantasy football players, we sometimes have players that we scratch off our list to draft for a variety of reasons. Whether that be anticipating regression, a change in team/coaching staff, the team drafting a rookie RB, etc. However, the draft day board sometimes doesn\u2019t fall your way and you have to do the \u201cughhh I guess I\u2019ll pick this guy\u201d with a begrudging attitude. Turns out that very same player can surprise you and produce at a rate you really weren\u2019t expecting. Who\u2019s that guy for you this year? </p>\n<p>My choice: easily James Cook. I was obsessed with leaving with Chase Brown in the 2nd round after going RB at the 1.03. Brown, Kyren, Jacobs, Bucky and Taylor were all gone by the time it was my turn to pick. So the choice was between Cook and Breece. Thankful so far that i went against my pre draft opinions and took a chance on who looks like a definitive RB1 rest of year.  </p>",

Henderson <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Fhqh9kbczhr7f1.jpeg\">struggled to force missed tackles on inside runs in college</a>, and the data isn't encouraging right now for him to take over the Patriots backfield, as the offseason consensus seems to point toward. </p>\n<p>Gibson seeing an increase role is definitely a bad thing. You don't want him even being part of the equation if you drafted Henderson. Gibson saw six opportunities in Week 2 to just two in Week 1. Of Henderson's 16 touches in Week 1, he forced just two missed tackles. I don't have the data for Week 2 yet, but his low MTF rate tracks with his struggles in college. At least when I analyzed the film, he often goes down after meaningful contact. </p>\n<p><strong>This is a very small sample size!!!</strong> The sample size is small. Does it mean the end of the world if you drafted Henderson? No. But things right now are trending in the wrong direction, and it's because Henderson hasn't done well in various areas of his game. He's obviously still the explosive athlete you saw returning the kickoff for the touchdown in the preseason. But that athleticism doesn't guarantee a backfield takeover. </p>\n<p>Moving forward, Rhamondre should have a prominent role at least for long at expected. The best case scenario is that Henderson takes over the backfield by midseason. Maybe if Stevenson fumbles a lot. The worst case scenario is that Henderson doesn't even keep the passing downs, which would be critical for his PPR upside. Him getting destroyed in pass pro and being responsible for at least two sacks in Week 2 won't help with that. And I don't think he has the between-the-tackle running chops to take that role either. </p>\n<p>The supposed prominent slot and split out wide receiving roles that he was expected to get haven't materialized either.</p>",

Although all charges were dropped a month later, the league is still looking into the matter, and his status for Week 2 remains uncertain after he missed practice following the meeting. Browns insider Ken Carman expects the NFL to hand down a heavy suspension, pointing to the league\u2019s desire to protect its image in the wake of past controversies like the Ray Rice case. Head coach Kevin Stefanski said the team will take things day by day, watching how Judkins practices before determining his availability.</p>",

If that offense keeps humming, he\u2019s going to be peppered (so long as Dimes is under center \ud83d\ude4f).

Long-term, the profile looks very real. In the near term, I don't expect this usage to continue, but it was nice to see while Mason Taylor, Terrance Ferguson &amp; Elijah Arroyo combined for 2 catches.</p>\n<p>The big question: are either of these guys legit long-term dynasty assets, or just the latest \u201crookie TE hype\u201d that fizzles?

But other top picks (<strong>Steelers</strong>, <strong>Cardinals</strong>) fell flat for us. And then the \"should've knowns\":  <strong>Rams</strong> (I noted only one other ranker appropriately higher on them), and basically all rankers missed on the <strong>Colts</strong>.</p>\n<p><em>As always, let's give it another go!</em>\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>We're still reliant on mostly pre-season assumptions... However even just 1 week of data gets integrated now, and it will help us avoid pitfalls we\u00a0just observed.</p>\n<h1>Week 2 Theme</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1n6i05y/defensive_maneuvers_2025_welcome_to_week_1/\">As promised in my season introduction</a>, I will spend this season on Reddit getting away from the simple idea of \"who's higher on my rankings list\".\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>There's often a lot of room to choose your\u00a0D/ST, so I believe it's important to focus more on interpreting the projections.</strong>\u00a0 This will help you better get the team that's right for you.</p>\n<p>So for this week, I'll do this in the most direct way possible: unveiling a new website tool we created!  The tool just started to go live, starting last weekend:</p>\n<p><strong>The new</strong> <a href=\"https://imgur.com/PlerWHV.jpeg\"><strong>bar charts</strong></a> <strong>show</strong> \"<strong><em>HOW</em></strong>  <strong>D/STs should make their points\".</strong>\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/1o1a2g3n3cof1.jpg?width=2399&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=73508585fee1e41a910d4da3b2df46f5380275b7\">Example bar charts (more below).  This is meant to help you think through your selection process. Ask yourself: (1) Does the breakdown make sense to you, or do you expect differences in some category?\u00a0 (2)  Do you prefer a certain type of D\\/ST \\\"fingerprint\\\"?</a></p>\n<h1>Here are key points about interpreting the charts</h1>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>I'm not just taking \"averages\" here.  I never do that.  Each category is based on its own predictive model.</strong>\u00a0 So for example, Fumble Recoveries is based on a number of input factors (weather, passing and rushing rates, D-line strength, betting lines, QB).  And the factors are limited to the ONLY the ones that tell me \"<em>would have predicted results in the past,</em> with least error\".\u00a0 Repeat: it's key to understand that I'm not just taking an average of past FRs or offensive fumbles.</li>\n<li><strong>Some values are negative, because the bars are shown relative to the league average.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Each category is in fantasy points.</strong> So you can compare the expected relative impact of each.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>Week 2</h1>\n<p><strong>Here are some top 12 D/STs this week,</strong> <strong><em>as organized in order from the Vegas implied opponent scores</em></strong> as of today (left to right, top to bottom).  (<a href=\"https://imgur.com/PlerWHV.jpeg\">Image linked here if you need to zoom</a>)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/4s3naqi83cof1.jpg?width=4300&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a78870b6fcb06cbf7062abf0fdc88b7702c22dfb\">Whether you use another source, or whether you use my own rankings on the website, my goal is to bring something \\\"out of the ordinary\\\" but still helpful.\u00a0 I hope a different perspective helps your thought process!</a></p>\n<p>I'll be happy to answer questions about the charts, and I hope you'll find them useful!</p>\n<h1>Other</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1n6i05y/defensive_maneuvers_2025_welcome_to_week_1/\">My last week's Season Intro explained \"How to Use\"</a> the various numbers and tools I'll be covering.\u00a0 Complaint?  There's no 2025 guidance at my website.\u00a0 (Valid!)\u00a0</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://subvertadown.com/article/how-to-get-most-out-of-the-subvertadown-website-2025\">So now you can read my <strong>10-step guide</strong> article, for recommendations \"How to Get the Most From\" the above tool (and others like it).</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://subvertadown.com/pick-six-by-six/2025/2\"><strong>Pick6x6</strong>:\u00a0 The new picks are ready for you to vote-- Don't forget before Sunday (linked here)!</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>/Subvertadown</strong></p>",

If you think a player is generally undervalued then he\u2019s a buy not a hold. If a players value looks steady and valued correctly then he\u2019s a hold not a buy/sell.
