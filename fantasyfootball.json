Although all charges were dropped a month later, the league is still looking into the matter, and his status for Week 2 remains uncertain after he missed practice following the meeting. Browns insider Ken Carman expects the NFL to hand down a heavy suspension, pointing to the league\u2019s desire to protect its image in the wake of past controversies like the Ray Rice case. Head coach Kevin Stefanski said the team will take things day by day, watching how Judkins practices before determining his availability.</p>",

Long-term, the profile looks very real. In the near term, I don't expect this usage to continue, but it was nice to see while Mason Taylor, Terrance Ferguson &amp; Elijah Arroyo combined for 2 catches.</p>\n<p>The big question: are either of these guys legit long-term dynasty assets, or just the latest \u201crookie TE hype\u201d that fizzles?

But other top picks (<strong>Steelers</strong>, <strong>Cardinals</strong>) fell flat for us. And then the \"should've knowns\":  <strong>Rams</strong> (I noted only one other ranker appropriately higher on them), and basically all rankers missed on the <strong>Colts</strong>.</p>\n<p><em>As always, let's give it another go!</em>\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>We're still reliant on mostly pre-season assumptions... However even just 1 week of data gets integrated now, and it will help us avoid pitfalls we\u00a0just observed.</p>\n<h1>Week 2 Theme</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1n6i05y/defensive_maneuvers_2025_welcome_to_week_1/\">As promised in my season introduction</a>, I will spend this season on Reddit getting away from the simple idea of \"who's higher on my rankings list\".\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>There's often a lot of room to choose your\u00a0D/ST, so I believe it's important to focus more on interpreting the projections.</strong>\u00a0 This will help you better get the team that's right for you.</p>\n<p>So for this week, I'll do this in the most direct way possible: unveiling a new website tool we created!  The tool just started to go live, starting last weekend:</p>\n<p><strong>The new</strong> <a href=\"https://imgur.com/PlerWHV.jpeg\"><strong>bar charts</strong></a> <strong>show</strong> \"<strong><em>HOW</em></strong>  <strong>D/STs should make their points\".</strong>\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/1o1a2g3n3cof1.jpg?width=2399&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=73508585fee1e41a910d4da3b2df46f5380275b7\">Example bar charts (more below).  This is meant to help you think through your selection process. Ask yourself: (1) Does the breakdown make sense to you, or do you expect differences in some category?\u00a0 (2)  Do you prefer a certain type of D\\/ST \\\"fingerprint\\\"?</a></p>\n<h1>Here are key points about interpreting the charts</h1>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>I'm not just taking \"averages\" here.  I never do that.  Each category is based on its own predictive model.</strong>\u00a0 So for example, Fumble Recoveries is based on a number of input factors (weather, passing and rushing rates, D-line strength, betting lines, QB).  And the factors are limited to the ONLY the ones that tell me \"<em>would have predicted results in the past,</em> with least error\".\u00a0 Repeat: it's key to understand that I'm not just taking an average of past FRs or offensive fumbles.</li>\n<li><strong>Some values are negative, because the bars are shown relative to the league average.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Each category is in fantasy points.</strong> So you can compare the expected relative impact of each.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>Week 2</h1>\n<p><strong>Here are some top 12 D/STs this week,</strong> <strong><em>as organized in order from the Vegas implied opponent scores</em></strong> as of today (left to right, top to bottom).  (<a href=\"https://imgur.com/PlerWHV.jpeg\">Image linked here if you need to zoom</a>)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/4s3naqi83cof1.jpg?width=4300&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a78870b6fcb06cbf7062abf0fdc88b7702c22dfb\">Whether you use another source, or whether you use my own rankings on the website, my goal is to bring something \\\"out of the ordinary\\\" but still helpful.\u00a0 I hope a different perspective helps your thought process!</a></p>\n<p>I'll be happy to answer questions about the charts, and I hope you'll find them useful!</p>\n<h1>Other</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1n6i05y/defensive_maneuvers_2025_welcome_to_week_1/\">My last week's Season Intro explained \"How to Use\"</a> the various numbers and tools I'll be covering.\u00a0 Complaint?

If you think a player is generally undervalued then he\u2019s a buy not a hold. If a players value looks steady and valued correctly then he\u2019s a hold not a buy/sell.

Mike from <a href=\"http://fantasygenius.io\">fantasygenius.io</a> here returning with my favorite Tuesday activity: laughing at the most brutal fantasy losses of the week. </p>\n<p>DJ Moore is the subject of our worst Week 1 beats. Earlier in the game, it looked like he had gotten seriously injured on <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/cjzero.bsky.social/post/3lyeqx3x6p22n\">this play</a>...</p>\n<p>But fortunately he was okay and came back into the game. He caught a lateral from Rome Odunze on the final play of the game and since the Bears were in desperation mode,\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQUNYGKKxsM\">pitched the ball</a>\u00a0as he was going down. For fantasy managers, that counts the same as any other fumble. Moore picked up 13 yards prior to fumbling, which means that in most leagues, this play cost D.J. Moore 0.7 points.

He fumbled in the game's final minutes. Tough to say that he \"cost\" you your matchup since he had a monstrous performance of 182 scrimmage yards and 2 TDs but what are fantasy managers if not irrational and angry? Squads with King Henry won 71% of their matchups but\u00a0<strong>372</strong>\u00a0teams in our dataset lost on the fumble. There were 10 squads we found with him on the bench and...really don't know what to say about that...</p>\n<p>Can only post one image in here but let me know if you have any players you'd like to see the breakdown for and we'll do our best to get you the data!</p>",
