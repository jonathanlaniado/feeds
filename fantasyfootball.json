More importantly, the  Bengals oline passed the eye test for the first time this year, generating good running lanes and frequently allowing Brown to get to the outside. Has Chase Brown turned a corner? Is he finally ready to give managers some sort of production? (Also please ignore his -8 yards on 2 receptions lol).</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>As the Alcoholic Haze fantasy football league gathered on Labor Day weekend to celebrate their 25th year together, there were laughs and hugs as friends who only see each other once a year were back in each other's presence. Many of them had traveled hundreds of miles to attend the annual event in Syracuse, NY.</p>\n<p>Well, except for one league manager.</p>\n<p>Bill Leaf, a founding member of the league, has never been to an in-person fantasy draft. His name isn\u2019t on the trophy that adorns the legends of the league. He\u2019s never held the championship belt awarded to the winner. The prize money hasn\u2019t hit his Venmo account.</p>\n<p>Bill was killed by a drunk driver on January 8, 2006.</p>\n<p>In the early morning hours of that frigid Sunday, Leaf, then 25, was driving to his office at WSYR radio, where he worked as a news reporter so that he could use the station's high-speed internet to research the upcoming Giants playoff game. Bill never made it to the studio.</p>\n<p>A driver going the wrong way on a downtown highway smashed into Leaf\u2019s Chevrolet Cavalier and ended the life of a promising sportscaster, brother, and friend.</p>\n<p>Leaf was a 2002 graduate of Syracuse University\u2019s prestigious Newhouse school, where he toiled in radio labs during the overnight hours to string together mock newscasts that would never see the light of day. Leaf worked tirelessly at the legendary radio station WAER to hone his craft on-air. The station that launched names such as Bob Costas, Mike Tirico, and Ian Eagle, to name a few, was shaping the future of its next great sports voice.</p>\n<p>The hours spent from freshman through senior year writing and recording sportscasts would culminate in Leaf\u2019s most significant moment at Syracuse when he was tabbed to call the play-by-play for the Orange vs Boston College football game in November of 2001. The man who grew up in the shadows of the Carrier Dome was now behind the microphone, calling the action for his beloved Orange.</p>\n<p>The plan was coming together. Leaf was on a path, realizing his dream.</p>\n<p>After graduation, Leaf would take on roles as a radio reporter and weekend TV sports anchor. The jobs, while not making Leaf rich financially, were filling his resume tape with gold that would one day lead him to a major market.</p>\n<p>Outside of work, Leaf was a diehard New York Giants and Mets fan. His encyclopedic sports knowledge was built on a foundation laid by his father, William Leaf Sr. The two would watch Giants games on Sundays at their family home in Syracuse. While Leaf\u2019s friends would make plans to visit a sports bar, the only son of the family would choose to keep the long-standing appointment on the couch next to his old man.</p>\n<p>During the winter of 2006, the elder Leaf was hospitalized with ALS. This debilitating disease took a once vibrant father of three who enjoyed his cigars in the park and confined him to a wheelchair, where he could barely speak. Young Bill took over the duties as man of the house. He looked after his mother and was handling the monthly bills that his father could no longer manage. When Bill was killed, the briefcase carrying his family's mail was in the backseat.</p>\n<p>As the elder Leaf was hospitalized, he couldn\u2019t attend the funeral services for his son. Instead, Bill\u2019s coffin was brought to the hospital, where his father was wheeled down to see him. The frail father of a son with limitless potential mustered the strength to reach his hand out towards his son and say, \u201cThat\u2019s my boy.\u201d</p>\n<p>William Leaf Sr. would pass away four months later.</p>\n<p>The heartbreak of losing someone in the prime of their life never truly heals. It\u2019s the way we remember them that keeps their spirit alive. Leaf was memorialized by a charity kickball tournament that brought together families who were impacted by drunk driving accidents. For 15 years, the Bill Leaf Memorial Kickball Tournament was the largest charity kickball event in New York state.</p>\n<p>On the day Leaf was killed, his hometown favorites, the New York Giants, would lose 23-0 to Jake Delhomme\u2019s Carolina Panthers in an NFC Wild Card matchup. Perhaps the Giants could feel the loss of their biggest fan.</p>\n<p>At Leaf\u2019s funeral, the Giants head coach and fellow Central New Yorker, Tom Coughlin, sent an autographed football. It would be buried with Bill.</p>\n<p>In January, it will mark 20 years since the tragic accident that took his life. In that span, his friends have grown and gotten married. Most have children who only know Bill from a photograph or a story. Meanwhile, Leaf lies in rest alongside both of his parents on Syracuse\u2019s north side. A future destined for the bright lights of television cameras turned black.</p>\n<p>As for his fantasy league, it continues to draft year after year. The bonds of friendship that brought them together are tested annually by age and distance. But that is what makes fantasy football so special. The community built over a game we can\u2019t control. It\u2019s why in-person drafts are vital to not only league success but the mental health of its members. Reaching out to your friends who you may only see in a group chat or at that once-a-year retreat can mean the world, as you never know what someone is going through.</p>\n<p>Bill would\u2019ve been overjoyed that his Giants, who won two Super Bowls since his passing, had conquered their arch rivals, the Philadelphia Eagles, on Thursday night football in Week 6, as the victory could've represented an early birthday present.</p>\n<p>Bill Leaf would\u2019ve turned 45 years old on Friday, October 10 - he was my best friend.</p>",
