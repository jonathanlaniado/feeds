This little tool helps developers and designers quickly access Apple's catalog of SF Symbols straight from their menu bar. Just click on a symbol to copy its name for use in code or designs. </p>\n<p>This is my first foray into building apps for the Mac, so I hope that any developers or designers here find it useful. Plus, it's free for a limited time.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/qodj71i9f0d71.png?width=2078&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5db4ee40b9a76ae93bfe5bb3ebaec477ae88666e\">Symbar screenshot</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/symbar/id1577268085?mt=12\">https://apps.apple.com/us/app/symbar/id1577268085?mt=12</a></p>\n<p>Disclosure: I built this app from scratch and am sharing it here for others who may find it useful.</p>",
