A\u00a0macOS native app with good performance on big files. Bike uses open file formats and is scriptable too. Use Bike to record and process your ideas.</p>\n<p>Try it out: <a href=\"https://www.hogbaysoftware.com/bike/\">Bike: Tool for thought</a></p>\n<h1>Fluid Editing</h1>\n<p>Outlines are powerful, but can be confusing. In Bike outline editing is fluid,\u00a0your ideas flow across the screen\u00a0instead of jumping from position to position. This makes it easier to track what's going on, and it's fun!</p>\n<p>Bike feels different. You can see Bike's fluid editing in this video:</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>https://reddit.com/link/urktds/video/ys6n367201091/player</p>\n<h1>Single Purchase or Subscription License</h1>\n<p>Bike is available directly from my website and through the Mac App Store. When buying directly you will own your copy of Bike and get 1 year of free updates. When buying from the Mac App Store Bike is sold using monthly or yearly subscriptions. Two coupon codes if you decide to buy from my site:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>REDDIT50</li>\n<li>50% off, only five uses</li>\n<li>REDDIT20</li>\n<li>20% off, expires May 31</li>\n</ul></div>",

My friends and I made an app that will probably be replaced by a future version of macOS someday, but it was too exciting not to do.</p>\n<p>This was all done after work over many months. In retrospect it\u2019s wild how much time goes into something like this. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s not perfect yet and we have a long list of things we want to improve, but we thought it\u2019d be a good time to get it out in the world and iterate based on feedback. </p>\n<p>It will also be available on Setapp starting later today or tomorrow, I\u2019m told.</p>\n<p>Fingers crossed \ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e it\u2019s not immediately obsolete by the upcoming WWDC announcements. \ud83d\ude2c Wouldn\u2019t surprise me. It was a lot of fun to make either way so I\u2019d still have done it again if that happens. That\u2019s probably not true, but we had fun nonetheless.</p>\n<p>Anyway, let me know if you have any questions or anything. We would like to involve everyone in future widget decisions and general making things better but still debating the best place to field lots of feedback. Maybe a subreddit? (Edit: And thus r/WidgetWall was born)</p>\n<p>I actually have to go to real work right now so it might be a while til I can respond, but I\u2019m excited to share this. Hope you like it! Thanks! -Ken</p>\n<p>https://amicoapps.com/app/widgetwall/</p>\n<p>Edit: Ok, a subscription model was a bad idea. Thank you for the feedback, it's helpful and we'll learn from it and make a better app from it.</p>\n<p>I also realize I did a disservice to my friends that built this with me when I presented the app like I did above, in a way where it might get replaced by Apple. I said that because I really feel like it's an app that should be a part of macOS. It feels very native and at home with it to me. So I am bracing myself for it to be replaced by something official because it feels like something official. I emphasized that a little too much and probably instilled concern in people considering trying it out though. But it doesn't exist yet, and maybe it won't ever. I don't know. It should. But it doesn't yet, so we have this you could use for now until it does.</p>\n<p>If anyone needs any really deep holes dug, I'm your guy.</p></div>",

I was looking for a translator which is always active in my status bar and is not needed to open a browser, switching context several times during a simple translation. I have found great translators, but I've switched a lot between \"from\" and \"to\" fields, because I was interested how is a sentence look like in more than two different languages.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://reddit.com/link/u5k1lt/video/r7q20sr262u81/player\">Translate between multiple languages.</a></p>\n<p>\ud83d\udca1 Features:</p>\n<p>- <strong>Limitless</strong>. The first translator supporting translation between multiple languages.<br />\n- You can <strong>edit any languages</strong> and others will mirror your text in their language.<br />\n- <strong>Shortcut support</strong>. You can open/close and switch language with a shortcut.<br />\n- <strong>Super Accurate</strong>. Using DeepL machine learning translation, which is proven the world's most accurate machine translation.<br />\n- <strong>OCR support</strong>. You can translate images, not just texts.<br />\n- <strong>Speech support</strong>. You can translate with your voice, without the need to write a single letter.<br />\n- <strong>Tailored for you!</strong> You control the font size, the active color, the input box height and the application language. Translating a lot? Set a bigger height and smaller font to see more. Translating words or shorter texts? Set a bigger font size and adjust a smaller input height to have more space. You are in control.<br />\n- <strong>Formality support.</strong>  Are you translating a mail response for an important client? Or you translate casual texts for your foreign friends? You decide how formal your text is going to be, by setting formality for your translatable languages.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/6378ugkmb2u81.jpg?width=1217&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b148b37d0b9b080eb4c4102a152b3f2cd5481627\">Set formality.</a></p>\n<p>\ud83d\udcf9 Showcase</p>\n<p>You can find a short video about each feature <a href=\"https://tinytranslate.app\">here</a>!</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>\ud83d\udd87 Links:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://tinytranslate.app\">Official website</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/tinytranslate/id1616724873\">Download</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/tiny_translate\">News</a></p></div>",

You activate it by double-pressing a modifier key and keeping it held down (you can adjust the sensitivity and duration). This will show an overlay of all your current windows with their name and window size. Moving the mouse over an application will highlight said app with a blue border letting you know you are controlling its window. At this point you just swipe with two fingers (with your other hand since you are still holding down the modifier key) in the direction of your preference and it\u2019ll dock it there. The neat thing is you can also use the arrow keys to perform the same actions. Double-clicking on a window will maximize it and you can than use the pinch gesture to scale the window to your liking (also just in one direction). Right clicking a window will minimize it.</p>\n<p>This has honestly changed how I interact with my computer. It doesn't have the same amount of window placements as other window managers but it is so quick and easy without needing to remember the blob of keyboard shortcuts.</p></div>",

If you are a non-trackpad and/or non-magic mouse user like me, you might be used to a rough scroll effect in every single app, and that does not look well. This is where <a href=\"https://mos.caldis.me\">Mos</a> comes, it enables you to get that smoother scroll effect you can expect from a magic mouse or a trackpad; that's a game changer in my opinion. </p>\n<p>That's it, you don't even have to buy a magic mouse or a trackpad ;)</p></div>",

With Monterey some new APIs made this possible in a simpler way, so I've decided to update one of my older pet projects with these new features. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://apple.co/34v7ohY\">Looking Glass</a> is a simple menu bar app coupled with an optional now playing window that aims to ease your interaction with the <em>Music</em> app (and avoid using it as much as possible). </p>\n<p>Unfortunately since we are still depending on the original Music app, we also inherit its bugs; on the plus side we will get for free the improvements Apple will hopefully make in next macOS releases. Anyway, the app works well enough for me, just bear in mind it might not be 100% perfect all the time. If you have issues, restarting it or Music may help.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The app is also compatible with Big Sur, but features such as adding tracks to library and playlists only work on Monterey.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<h3>Library search</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/RjzAL3P\">Demo</a></p>\n<p>You can type to search for tracks, albums, artists and playlists in your library, and click on the menu item that appears to start playing immediately. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You have to type <em>at least three characters</em> to activate the search.\nOn some older macOS releases I've noticed that you also have to <em>hover the search</em> field to type, otherwise the menu gets closed. Maybe it was a bug, since on Monterey you can start typing as soon as you open the menu.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Current track details</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/GY8klD5\">Demo</a></p>\n<p>Another very neat feature are the three <em>now playing</em> menu items:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Track</strong> brings you to the context of the currently playing track, such as the album or the playlist you've played it from</li>\n<li><strong>Artist</strong> brings you to the artist page</li>\n<li><strong>Album</strong> opens the album page</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The latter two are available from macOS 12+ only</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Add to Library</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/ogkrpR6\">Demo</a></p>\n<p>I've combined this feature into the \u2764\ufe0f button, so you can quickly love a track and add it to your library.  You can enable this option in the <em>Preferences</em> panel.</p>\n<h3>Rating and Add to Playlist</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/OvipKE6\">Demo</a></p>\n<p>With the <em>Rate and add...</em> menu you can quickly add tracks to a playlist and rate the current track. The first couple of playlist also have an associated keyboard shortcut, so that you can pick them without using the pointer.</p>\n<h3>Preferences</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/BHhOx0U\">Screenshot</a></p>\n<p>With the <em>Preferences</em> panel you can customize the title displayed in the menu bar, its maximum width, the keyboard shortcuts and some behavior settings. There's also an <em>About</em> panel with version and contact informations.</p>\n<h3>Keyboard shortcuts</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/X6JS95o\">Screenshot</a></p>\n<p>You can customize several global hotkeys, or leave them blank if you prefer. This is the setup I use with my mechanical keyboard.</p>\n<h3>Mini Player</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/maTGJXR\">Screenshot</a></p>\n<p>The mini player provides the album cover of the current track and keyboard shortcuts:</p>\n<p>|Key|Action|\n|---|---|\n|<strong>s</strong> or <strong>space</strong>|Toggle playback|\n|<strong>a</strong> or <strong>\u2192</strong>|Jump to next track|\n|<strong>d</strong> or <strong>\u2190</strong>|Jump to previous track|\n|<strong>w</strong>|Show Music window|\n|<strong>r</strong>|Reveal current track|\n|<strong>l</strong>|Love current track|</p>\n<h2>Links</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://apple.co/34v7ohY\">App Store</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/posts/looking-glass\">Product Hunt page</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/reviews/managing-music-from-your-macs-menu-bar/\">MacStories article</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you like the app, I'd be glad if you could give a nice review!</p>\n<h3>Promo codes</h3>\n<p>AARFLY9YMKP7\nKA3FT6HKK7LF\nTERX7NPFTR9F\nM3EL7J6AWXHK\nKEKE4LE36L7R\n34TRJNKPMEPE\n9YRLL9AREW94\nMP3XKM7TJ4NK\nAAF3PEXHYA7W\nHK6JR34AWT3W\n6YW7X4WFHAAH\nM97FL94H4LXH\nJETEPN676XAH\nMMFEWTWW346R\nFFX9FE3YYRJX\nHHAXKJA9KNKN\nYPNERHT9P6W7\nKFTFXMANRPFR\n34EFXAKK333W\nXNHEM94M9R47</p></div>",

As both open source contributor and Mac users myself, I have tried many open sources apps and there are a few I find quite essential. Therefore I have curated <a href=\"https://oss.wiki/\">https://oss.wiki/</a> to easily find and filter apps based on tech stack and topic.  </p>\n<p>A few apps I can't live without are:</p>\n<p>- Rectangle: window manager </p>\n<p>- Pika: color picker </p>\n<p>- Kap: screen recorder</p>\n<p>- Insomnia: Rest API testing </p>\n<p>- Itsycal: calendar </p>\n<p>- iTerm2: terminal</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Would love to get to know more apps and I would love to add them to the list to spread the words</p></div>",
