As a Uni student, here are the apps that I use every day and my honest user experience and feedback. Most of the apps installed are free, but any that aren't will have their price factored into my overall review. </p>\n<p><strong>All of these apps are super easy to install and use and don't require any complex coding knowledge!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. Media Mate</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wouter01.github.io/MediaMate/\">Media Mate Website</a></p>\n<p>I came across this app 2+ years ago, right when it launched. I hated the Vanilla macOS volume and brightness HUD, and Media Mate was an amazing alternative. In the last two years, the developer(s) have continued to refine and perfect this app with new features and customization options. It is one of the easiest apps to install and set up thanks to its super intuitive UI. While other Notch Apps have come since then that offer more features, none of them do what Media Mate does, as well as Media Mate does it. This app is perfect for anyone looking to refresh some aspects of the outdated macOS HUD. As one of the few paid apps on this list, the modest price tag of 7 euros (roughly $7 USD or $10 CAD) gives you lifetime access to 5 licences. I was more than satisfied with the price when I bought it 2 years ago and since then, the dev(s) have blown me away time and time again. Their ability to constantly release bug-free updates (I have never encountered a bug in my time using it) and well-refined make Media Mate integrate beautifully into macOS. To further emphasize how seamless this app is, I have found myself looking at a friend's computer when they change their volume and almost forgetting the Media Mate isn't a part of the Vanilla macOS. THAT'S HOW SEAMLESSLY THIS APP INTEGRATES INTO YOUR MAC!</p>\n<p>After over 2 years of use, I can confidently say that Media Mate gets a 10/10 from me. It does its job beautifully, and updates never feel like they were rushed out unfinished. Apps have come since which try to be better by having more bells and whistles but for those who just want an app which perfectly adds to your Mac, Media Mate stands alone as the best.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Ice</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/jordanbaird/Ice/blob/main/README.md\">Ice Github Page</a></p>\n<p>Inspired by Bartender, Ice allows you to customize your menu bar and give it a clean and minimalist look. I love that this app solved my constant gripe about having a cluttered menu bar. I got this app initially before getting a Bartender key from someone else, so I'm able to give a direct comparison between the two. You are able to decide between \u201cAlways shown,\u201d \u201cHidden,\u201d and \u201cAlways Hidden.\u201d</p>\n<p>Always shown is pretty self-explanatory. Items in the always-shown section will always be visible. I only have the date and time there, but that's just my love of minimalism speaking.</p>\n<p>Hidden is for your icons that you use semi-regularly but don't want to see all the time. These icons are revealed by dragging the mouse to the top of the screen. With the icons hiding again after moving the mouse away. This is where I keep my Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and other icons that I visit on a fairly regular basis but not too often.</p>\n<p>Always hidden works the same as the hidden section, except it doesn't reveal when you drag your mouse to the top of the screen. Instead, simply hold option and click the top of the screen to reveal the always hidden bar, which goes back to being hidden once you move the mouse away from the top of the screen. I really only use this for certain apps which force an icon into the menu bar with no ability to disable it.</p>\n<p>There are two reasons why, in my opinion, Ice is actually a better app than Bartender, which I will explain below.</p>\n<p>Number one: IT'S FREE. The beauty of the app being free is that if you don't like it, you can uninstall and never think about it again. For offering all the same features without the cost, there isn't any drawback to at least trying out Ice before spending a whopping $30 CAD (approx 20 USD and Euro) on Bartender. After showing Ice to the person who gave me their bartender key, he was pretty pissed that he'd spent all that money, and I was able to get the same thing for free.</p>\n<p>Number two: This may not be much to everyone, but I love it. When Bartender hides apps from your menu bar, it replaces them with a plain grey space, which is pretty lame compared to what Ice has to offer. With Ice, any area which isn't being used in your menu bar is instead seamlessly replaced by your wallpaper! This feature works regardless of if you're using a still image or a dynamic wallpaper. Ice will always fill the space back in, which makes the menu bar much smaller and your screen much bigger! It reminds me of when Apple switched from the notch to the dynamic island with the iPhone 14. Even though there wasn't much more screen space being added, the screen feels much bigger and the camera housing feels less pronounced than with the notch. Overall, while this feature doesn't serve much of a use, it makes the top of your screen feel much cleaner without the grey bar running along the top of it.</p>\n<p>Overall, Ice gets an 8/10 from me. It has a few bugs now and then, but its dev team is super responsive to feedback and works really hard to fix bugs in a timely manner. Even with that in mind, there is no world where spending $30 on Bartender is better than at least trying Ice at no cost. For me, This is a rare example of an app where the free version is better than the paid.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Icon Champ</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macenhance.com/iconchamp.html\">IconChamp Install</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=487G8qaBky0&amp;ab_channel=MacProTips\">IconChamp YouTube Tutorial</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://macosicons.com/#/\">Mac Icons</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/image2icon-make-your-icons/id992115977?mt=12\">Image2Icon File Converter</a></p>\n<p>One of my most recent additions, IconChamp is another app that helps you modernize your Mac by giving you the ability to change your app icons to whatever you want. I love the dark icons that came out in iOS18 and wanted a way to give all the apps in my dock a common theme.</p>\n<p>This app has both a free and paid version. The free version allows you to change any apps that you have installed manually, as well as your folder icons on your user folders. The paid version is the only app I've ever been able to find which gives you the ability to change the icons of the base macOS apps and folders. The paid version gives you 3 keys and comes in at a price of approx $15 CAD (approx 10 USD and Euro). It's not the cheapest app, and most people will probably be more than fine with the free version, but the paid version gives that extra bit of personalization we all love (it's the reason that I, along with so many others, are in this subreddit in the first place).</p>\n<p>The beauty of IconChamp is that it's a simple drag-and-drop process, it doesn't require you to disable any security features, and any changes can be reverted with (literally) one click of a button. Since the release of macOS Sequoia, the app has gained a few bugs which, as far as I can see, haven't had any attempts of being remedied. I had to play around with it a bit and came across a YouTube video which helped me install the right version and gave the full run tutorial. I was able to get the majority of my images from the website featured in the video. For the apps which I couldn't find a version I liked on the website, I simply googled what I was looking for and used another app which will also be linked to convert the .png into a .icns file (the standard file type used for Apple app icons)(Since that, I noticed on their website that they claim to accept \u201call standard image file types,\u201d so I think I took the scenic route for those extra icons by installing a whole other app to convert the file). One bug I encountered after uploading my desired icons was that while the app icons changed in the launchpad, the apps in my dock stayed the same. This was easily fixed by removing and re-adding those apps to my dock. The one app I haven't been able to change is the Calendar app. From doing some research online, it seems that the Calendar app has something special about it which makes it impossible to change its icon. Regardless, I love the ability to customize the rest of my apps and give my computer a more cohesive theme.</p>\n<p>Overall, I rate IconChamps a 7/10. While it has some bugs and the process can be a bit tedious, I found the finished product to be worth the process. The shared theme in my dock really makes it look a thousand times better, and I love that IconChamp is able to change system apps on top of third-party ones. The price tag for the pro version will certainly turn some people off, but the free version is still an amazing app for anyone wanting to update some older app icons.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Notch Focus Timer</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/notch-focus-timer/id6477333821?mt=12&amp;src=AppAgg.com\">Notch Focus Timer</a></p>\n<p>One of the most simple additions to any Mac with a notch, Notch Timer is a super clean timer app that uses the Notch to display how long is left. The app is controlled through the menu bar, where, unlike Apple, you can set a timer as long as you'd like (seriously, I was able to make a time for 1,000,000,000 hours). You can also pause or stop the timer by simply dragging the mouse into the notch, which causes the timer to expand and display how long is left, and the buttons to pause or cancel. Notch Timer also allows you to toggle for different sounds to play once the timer has finished, and even change the colour of the bar wrapping around the notch to be any colour you desire. At a price of free and already on the App Store, there's no reason not to have this simple app on your Mac.</p>\n<p>Notch Focus Timer gets a 9/10. I can't think of any shortcomings in this app or any reason not to install it. The only concern I have is that I don't believe there is any way to delete a custom timer and I fear I now have a timer for 1,000,000,000 hours and no way to delete it. For what it is, it's pretty close to perfect. It's simple, it works perfectly, and it's super easy to use. Not every app needs to have 100 features, and this is a perfect example of that. Notch Timer does one thing, and it does it perfectly, so I can't ask anything more from it.</p>\n<p><strong>5. boringNotch</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://theboring.name/\">boringNotch Install</a></p>\n<p>I previously asked this subreddit which notch app was considered the best. As I anticipated, everyone had their own answer. The thing with these notch apps like Alcove, Dynamic Lake, and NotchNook, is that they all have different pros and cons, making this review a little more subjective. After doing the trial on those previously mentioned apps, I decided to try boringNotch before deciding which app to commit to. Since installing boringNotch, I have forgotten about the other 3. boringNotch is quite similar to NotchNook, but a little simpler with not as many bugs.</p>\n<p>As a bit of a newer app, boringNotch doesn't have all of the features that its competition does, but that isn't always a bad thing. The devs have a clear roadmap on their GitHub page which clearly outlines the features they have planned, and an active discord community in which they tease new features, answer community questions, and investigate bug reports. Currently, boringNotch has an integrated calendar, media player, and drop tray for files, among other things. While boringNotch doesn't currently offer a system hud replacement, it's been teased numerous times and looks to hopefully be ready for release in due course. I've come up with a temporary solution to this by using MediaMate for my system hud and boringNotch for its media player and other features. The team working on this app is passionate about their work and has a strong base and a roadmap which looks promising for the future. I haven't encountered any major bugs using boringNotch and the devs are good about looking into issues and fixing major problems in a timely manner.</p>\n<p>Considering the price, its competition, and the plans for the future, I've gone with an 8/10 for boringNotch. Sure other notch apps may have more features, but is the number of features the only thing used to decide which is better? Of course not. boringNotch is surprisingly stable for being a newer app and it's started with a really strong base. I look forward to seeing the devs continue to build off of their strong start as they work through their roadmap</p>\n<p><strong>5. Dato</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dato/id1470584107?mt=12\">Dato on the Apple App Store</a></p>\n<p>Having used Dato for a couple of years now, it's another one of those apps that I often forget isn't a part of macOS for everyone! Dato makes it easy to access your calendar and see your upcoming events by simply clicking the icon in the menu bar. It makes it super easy to check your schedule coming up without having to open the calendar app every time. It's another one of those apps that feels super seamless and having used it for over 2 years now, I can't imagine using my Mac without it. I probably use it 2-3 times A DAY because it just makes accessing your calendar so easy. It is the most expensive app on here, costing $16 USD ($23 CAD or approx 15 euros) from the App Store, but I can assure you that you will find Dato to be an absolute essential that is definitely worth the price.</p>\n<p>I'm giving Dato an 8/10. I've never encountered a bug using Dato and I'm confident to say that it will change how you use your calendar on your Mac. My only issue with Dato is the price. I fear that without a free trial, many will underestimate how amazing Dato is, and be turned away by its steep price. Furthermore, by being in the App Store instead of giving a few licence keys which could be split between a few people. Unless you are a part of Family Sharing like I was, $16 USD for one person is a high price to pay and definitely reduces the number of new users. However, those who push past the price will understand why I only docked 2 points from its rating. I promise you, the sting of the price will go away, and you will be left with a truly revolutionary app that totally changes how you use your calendar.</p>\n<p><strong>6. DockDoor</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/ejbills/DockDoor\">DockDoor Github</a></p>\n<p>Another recent installation, DockDoor makes it so much easier to manage all your windows. I usually like to keep my browser windows organized based on what I'm doing. This means I usually have 3 or 4 windows at a time for the different things I'm doing on my laptop. DockDoor will show you a preview of each window as you hover over it, making it super easy to manage and change windows. It's got a ton of customization and is another one of those apps that makes using a Mac that little bit better. I like being able to get a quick preview of what I have running on each app and I would totally recommend it for people who tend to have numerous apps and windows open at the same time. I've only had DockDoor for a little while now so I can't give the most in-depth review of it but my experience so far made it impossible to leave off of this list.</p>\n<p>Given DockDoor is free, it's another one of those apps where there's no reason not to install it and try it out. As a relatively newer app, I've encountered a few bugs which I'm sure will be fixed, but nothing that impacts your overall user experience. For these reasons, I've given DockDoor an 8/10 because I'm sure its bugs will be fixed and when that happens, you're left with a free app that makes managing your windows so much easier.</p>",

I recently shared a\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/appletv/comments/1h2qonl/was_gonna_discount_my_apple_tv_apps_for_black/\">similar\u00a0offer\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0Apple\u00a0TV\u00a0sub</a>\u00a0for several of my Apple TV apps during Black Friday and was thrilled by the overwhelming response and gratitude. It inspired me to extend the same generosity to this sub with my macOS app for Cyber Monday! As a way to express my appreciation, I\u2019m making my Mac meeting app,\u00a0<strong>MeetingMenu</strong>, completely\u00a0<strong>FREE</strong>\u00a0until midnight on December 3, UTC! No subscriptions, no catch\u2014just download and enjoy.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m the developer of MeetingMenu, a Mac app I created to solve my own meeting management headaches. Like many of you, I find myself doing lots of meetings online across various apps. I\u2019m frequently accessing the same settings and tools during meetings, and I wanted a way to keep them all in one convenient place\u2014right in the menu bar.</p>\n<p>Most important for me was being able to see my next meeting at a glance, with a countdown timer and the ability to launch it with a single click\u2014right in the menu bar. That feature alone has been a game-changer for staying organized and never missing a meeting.</p>\n<p>In addition, I wanted tools to simplify screen sharing, like quickly hiding my desktop, icons, and wallpaper to avoid any awkward moments. I also built in a privacy browser to prevent my bookmarks or history from showing during meetings.</p>\n<p>As I kept using it, I realized there were even more tools I frequently needed that were buried within the user interfaces of various meeting apps. So, I bundled them all into one app:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tools to quickly check my mic volume and see how I look on camera before meetings.</li>\n<li>A quick meeting launcher for platforms like Zoom, Teams, and Google Meet.</li>\n<li>Custom time zone views to see meeting times in different regions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other features include: sticky notes, in-meeting indicator, low power mode, WiFi signal check, audio quality test, and more\u2014all accessible from the menu bar.</p>\n<p>Yes, I know there are apps with overlapping features, but I needed something that combined everything I rely on in one place\u2014like a Swiss Army knife for meeting tools.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s how MeetingMenu came to life, and it\u2019s been a lifesaver for me. It\u2019s still relatively new, so I\u2019d really appreciate any feedback, feature suggestions, or tips to make it better for the community.</p>\n<p>\u23f3\u00a0<strong>This is a one-day offer, valid until midnight on December 3, UTC.</strong>\u00a0Must download today before it goes back to being paid.</p>\n<p>\ud83d\udc49\u00a0<a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/meetingmenu/id6538714770\">Download\u00a0MeetingMenu\u00a0for\u00a0Mac</a><br />\n\ud83d\udc49\u00a0<a href=\"https://meetingmenu.app/\">Visit\u00a0the\u00a0MeetingMenu\u00a0website</a></p>\n<p>Thanks again to this amazing community for your support\u2014you\u2019re the best!

Unless you can't. Then you have a problem. Or, maybe you are experimenting with <a href=\"https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/open-core-legacy-patcher\">Open Core Legacy Patcher</a> to install a later version of macOS on a device that doesn't officially support it. In that case, you are going to need a copy of an OS, preferably bootable, and some sort of media to copy that OS installation onto. You can do the installation through other methods, like target disk mode or various imaging applications too, but they take some know how. The other thing you can use these files for is when experimenting with virtual machines in something like Virtual Box, UTM or VMWare Fusion.</p>\n<p><strong>Mist</strong></p>\n<p>To get a copy of the firmware and OS you need, I know of no easier method than using <a href=\"https://github.com/ninxsoft/Mist?tab=readme-ov-file\">Mist</a>, a free app available on GitHub. With Mist, you can get everything from the latest beta, all the way back to Mac OS X 7.5. You can get Intel or Apple Silicon installers, or the universal installers available for macOS Big Sur and later.</p>\n<p><strong>Balena Etcher</strong></p>\n<p>If you are planning to use an SD card or a USB drive, things work better when you flash the media than when you try to fiddle with partitions and permissions on your own from the command line. Luckily, there is an app for that. It is <a href=\"https://etcher.balena.io/\">Balena Etcher</a>, a free app with built-in safeguards to keep you from erasing the wrong drive. Balena Etcher will also create bootable media for Windows and various Linux builds too.</p>",

I\u2019ve just published my second macOS app, which detects when the last window of an app is closed and quits that app. This helps prevent unnecessary memory usage by apps that are not actively being used. While macOS does have built-in memory management, I\u2019ve encountered situations where the system runs out of memory without closing inactive apps. I created this app to ensure all apps without open windows are closed. The app is free\u2014hope you enjoy it, and feel free to share any feedback. Cheers.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://lawand.io/last-window-quits/\">https://lawand.io/last-window-quits/</a></p>",

Absolutely irreplaceable.</p>\n<p><strong>2.  RayCast:</strong><br />\nI tried RayCast twice for 1-2 days, wasn't sure how to use it, then I tried it again by going all-in and replacing Spotlight keyboard shortcut with Raycast and man, I'm in live with it more and more everyday! This is an absolutely must-have for developers and normal users alike.</p>\n<p>Their Clipboard history with option to search in Images (OCR) works amazingly and is very snappy.</p>\n<p>It can do wonderful stuff including so many calculations (days to, since specific date, modifying text, Quick snippets to quickly fill tons of texts, replaces MacOS's native Text Replacement much better by allowing to to have multi-line replacements and so much more)</p>\n<p>You can do everything with a keyboard shortcut including making windows full-screen, maximizing, minimizing, specific sizes (left half, first third-half and so much more)|  </p>\n<p><strong>3.  Shottr:</strong><br />\nA wonderful, super-lightweight Screenshot tool, can do a lot more than MacOS' native screenshot tool and works like a charm. You can now add 'backdrop', gradient style backgrounds to screenshots too, the popular style for code and other screenshots these days, and is super super fast!  </p>\n<p>MonitorControl and Lunar:<br />\nThese are both great for managing brightness of your external monitors using keyboard shortcuts, a must have if you use external monitor regularly.  </p>\n<p><strong>4.  Rectangle:</strong><br />\nThis is my Window manager of choice, both free and Pro versions are great. A lot more feature than MacOS' built-in windows manager (that was released just recently in Sequoia) and works amazing with RayCast support.</p>\n<p><strong>5.  ChatGPT:</strong><br />\nChatGPT's Mac native app is amazing! The quickbar works great and it is not possible to live without it. Much easier access compared to the web-version.  </p>\n<p>What are yours?</p>",

The Wispr Team deactivated my Slack account on their workspace after asking polite and totally fair questions there in my mind. Super shady inner workings in this app in my opinion. And a red flag how they treat their users. Definitely did not feel right from the start. (I used it for about a month).</p>\n<p>My post on Slack before they banned me on their Slack (oh and I also said that I was going to uninstall because I realized after removing it from login items, because I was done with it for a while, only to realize THAT IT WILL INJECT ITSELF INTO YOUR LOGIN ITEMS AGAIN SOMEHOW ON LOGIN.</p>\n<p>\"Hey Wispr team,</p>\n<p>I've been using Flow for a while now, and I've got to say, the functionality is impressive. However, I have several concerns:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>System Integration:\nThe app for some reason ruins my right-click context menu in Firefox. Extension options in right-click context menus disappear on hover. I spent hours troubleshooting, even ended up nuking my Firefox setup, only to find out Flow was the culprit. What is it doing in Firefox anyway?\nSuddenly, I'm seeing the Wispr Flow logo in my Chrome address bar. I don't remember enabling this, and there seems to be no way to turn this off?\nThe app adds itself to login items every time it's launched. This is not standard behavior and feels intrusive.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Resource Usage:\nThe app is a whopping 800MB, which feels kind of big for a dictation tool?\nIt's constantly using about 8% CPU, even when idle. What's it doing in the background?\nLaunch time is around 10 seconds with quirky loading messages. What's really happening during this \"setup\"?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Deep Integration and Privacy Concerns:\nThe onboarding checklist actually tracks actions across apps. It knew when I used Discord, ChatGPT, mail and other apps which I don't remember 100%. This level of system awareness is alarming.\nYour promo video shows the app using context to correctly spell unusual names in emails. How exactly is this context gathered? Does it capture my screen or what?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Transparency Issues:\nYour privacy policy is vague and broad. It doesn't provide clear limits on data use or specific explanations of what data is collected in different scenarios.\nThe policy mentions using customer content to train AI models. Does this include my dictations and the context you gather?\nThere's no clear documentation about the app's system interactions or the full extent of its capabilities.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Browser Integration:\nThe Chrome and Firefox integrations appeared without clear user consent or easy ways to disable them.\nWhat exactly are these browser integrations doing? Are they monitoring my web activity?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Data Collection and Usage:\nGiven the app's deep integration and context awareness, what exactly are you collecting?\nHow is this data being used beyond the immediate dictation functionality?\nAre you sharing this data with third parties? If so, with whom and for what purposes?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>User Control:\nThere seems to be a lack of granular controls for the app's various integrations and features.\nHow can users opt out of specific data collection or feature integrations?\nHow can users opt out of injections into certain apps? Shouldn't it be opt-in?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Security Concerns:\nWith such deep system access, what security measures are in place to protect user data?\nHow are you safeguarding against potential misuse of the app's extensive permissions?</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Don't get me wrong - the core functionality of Flow is impressive. The dictation accuracy, speed, and cross-app functionality are genuinely useful. But right now, using Flow feels like I've given an unknown entity unfettered access to my digital life. Given these concerns, I'm hesitant about becoming a paid subscriber.</p>\n<p>We need some real transparency here:\n1. Can you provide a detailed, technical explanation of Flow's system access and integration methods?\n2. What specific data are you collecting, and how exactly is it being used and protected?\n3. Can we get more granular user controls over the app's various features and integrations?\n4. Are there plans to optimize the app's resource usage and size?\n5. How are you ensuring user privacy and security given the app's deep system access?</p>\n<p>I want to continue using Flow, but I need to fully understand what I'm permitting on my system. Looking forward to your detailed response.\"</p>\n<p>I've got some email correspondence with them and I had more questions in the Slack which went unanswered.</p>",

I\u2019ve been hunting for some new productivity apps for my Mac, and after a bit of experimenting, I found some lesser-known gems that really helped me streamline my work. These apps are on the rise and definitely worth checking out:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Flow by Wispr</strong>: If you\u2019ve got a lot of ideas but not enough time to type them all out, Flow is a great voice-to-text app. It\u2019s not just about dictation\u2014it actually personalizes your written word to match your natural style. I\u2019ve found it super helpful when I\u2019m multitasking or trying to capture ideas on the fly.</li>\n<li><strong>Raycast</strong>: Similar to Alfred but sleeker and faster. It\u2019s a productivity launcher that lets you manage apps, scripts, and even GitHub or Slack right from your keyboard. It\u2019s perfect if you love hotkeys and avoiding the mouse altogether.</li>\n<li><strong>TickTick</strong>: A to-do list app that comes with an integrated Pomodoro timer and habit tracker. It\u2019s been my go-to for managing tasks and staying focused on one thing at a time. Plus, it\u2019s flexible enough for both work and personal use.</li>\n<li><strong>Superhuman</strong>: For anyone who deals with a flood of emails, this one\u2019s a game-changer. It\u2019s an email app that focuses on speed and minimalism, helping you get through your inbox faster than ever. Super helpful for cutting through the clutter!</li>\n<li><strong>Loom</strong>: Loom\u2019s a video messaging tool, but it\u2019s perfect for sending quick updates or feedback without typing long emails. I use it to create short video walk-throughs for my team, and it saves so much time compared to typing everything out.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Lemme know if you've tried knew stuff that stuck!</p>",

You can throw just about any type of video file at it and VLC will play it. Whenever someone tries to use something else and runs into a problem, I generally won't help them unless they try to use VLC first. So, you can imagine that I was rather dubious when I first encountered <a href=\"https://iina.io/\">IINA</a>, a free and open-source video and audio player. I do have to admit that it is way better looking. VLC is still rocking that Windows XP vibe and IINA has a sleek, post-Yosemite native macOS design aesthetic. It is lovely to look at. When I looked into it, I found that it is a front end for two rock solid CLI video platforms ff-mpeg and mpv. It can play just about anything VLC can play.</p>\n<h1>Other IINA Features</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>IINA is easy to customize. You can control playback speed, video rotation, aspect ratio adjustment, deinterlacing, and more.</li>\n<li>IINA plays online videos easily through URL support</li>\n<li>It has very strong sub-title support with built in search, language choice (be sure to set a default language in settings), size and adjustable timing</li>\n<li>Although it doesn't do editing, it can serve as a QuickTime replacement for playback</li>\n<li>Gesture control using a trackpad or Magic Mouse for most program features</li>\n<li>Supports picture in picture mode for multi-tasking</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can get IINA on <a href=\"https://iina.io/\">the project's website</a> or on <a href=\"https://github.com/iina/iina\">GitHub</a>.</p>",

I've been using it for over 3 months and was a beta tester for it. The app is supposed to launch really soon and it's going to become paid, I think. Just sending it across to let you know that it\u2019s finally open to download directly from the website now.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Wispr Flow.</strong> It\u2019s a speech to text tool that understands you, it\u2019s like having a personal assistant who reads your mind. I\u2019m Indian so most names I say are \u201ccomplicated\u201d but this tool gets it. And you wont get a blob of text that you\u2019ll need to fix, you\u2019ll receive a well formatted document. I generally use it for emails, texting and essays but it works in any text box out there so give it a whirl (its free rn)</p>\n<p>It adapts to your writing style, gets your names right, and fixes your grammar. It also knows over 100 languages which is pretty cool because that's the best use case for me, if I have to text people who don't understand English I can just ask it to convert it to my mother tongue at the end of the sentence and it does that which has made communication so much easier.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In terms of productivity, I think my favourite use is just answering emails using this and just using it on Slack because it's just that much faster and because it structures it into paragraphs and bullet points I don't even need to worry about it I just hit send right away. Gives me a bunch of time. The convenience of it helps me not get too tired, and I feel I'm a better communicator because I'm not stingy with my words because keyboards used to be so annoying to type (each word) but now I can just ramble on (this post has been written by flow, so expect it to be long).</p>\n<p>To top it all off, I am a writer, a hobbyist in fact at this point because can't pursue it professionally just yet. However, this tool was kind of a godsend.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I never thought that I would be using speech for long form writing and I was even very confused about it. But I just feel so relieved. There is no overwhelming feeling before I actually get to writing now. It's just a freeing feeling knowing that it's going to be convenient and that is why I don't even procrastinate too much. I feel like it's just a way to trick my brain into actually working since the physical effort is practically wiped out and there is such a low edit rate. It's personalized to how I write because there's tone match there that I never have to really edit proper nouns or anything when I'm writing it. And any fictitious names that I come up with for my writing, I can just add it to the dictionary so it gets it right every time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I've had the best time using it. It's just become an integral part of my work. And while I would hope for it to be free forever, they're launching it on 30th, which means that after that, there's going to be a freemium version. So anyone, students, professionals, whoever feels like this is something that could help take even a little bit of anxiety off your head, do it because work's not getting any shorter and our life's not getting any longer :)</p>",

But it looks like there's no more codes I can generate. So I made the app free for 24 hours. If you didn't get a code last time now is your chance to get the app :)</p>\n<p>All you have to do is go to https://apps.apple.com/app/power-node-mind-map/id1195518228 and download it. Run the app and press on any of the \"Buy\" buttons. You can then \"purchase\" the Full Version unlock for $0.00. And that's it. The app is yours :)</p>\n<p>(The message box at the start will tell you the price is $19.99 but that's just a display error - the app is still free, the App Store will tell you this when you go through the \"purchase\" process).</p>\n<p>If anyone is interested to know what's new in 1.2:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<ul>\n<li>Support for opening .txt, .rtf, .docx, .md and .opml files (via File -&gt; Open)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<ul>\n<li>Export of OPML files (vie File -&gt; Export)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<ul>\n<li>You can paste in raw OPML code and the app will generate nodes from the structure (other Mind Mappers will just mindlessly paste in the OPML source code). Hint: You can ask all those AIs to format their output in OPML for easier pasting into Power Node</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<ul>\n<li>A few bugfixes</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I'd be thrilled to hear any feedback, feature requests, etc.! And if you like the app (or don't) you can leave a review/rating but please be honest :)</p>\n<p><em>Info: This promo runs until this post is 24 hours old. Then I'll change the price back.</em></p>",

Future plans to make a dedicated macOS app. More details at the bottom.</em></p>\n<p>I\u2019m excited to share that I have recently created not just a dictionary app, but an entire dictionary from the ground up. It\u2019s completely free without ads. I call it\u00a0<a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lngo-the-peoples-dictionary/id6596728974\">Lngo: The People's Dictionary</a>.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Why did I do this?</strong>\u00a0I have a profound love for language, and I was continually frustrated with cancer-level ads on other dictionary apps, and the extortion of subscription fees. The free app alternatives often had outdated definitions, clunky designs, and missing features like saving or syncing words.</p>\n<p>I know a dedicated dictionary app might not be for everyone. Many people use a browser or iPhone\u2019s Spotlight search. This app is tailored for those who love diving deep into word definitions, exploring etymology, and actively trying to expand their vocabulary by saving words for future study and review.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I teamed up with a small group of software engineers and those with backgrounds in linguistics, to build this app. We all shared the same grievance with the lackluster dictionary options available on the Apple ecosystem. So we sifted through open-source dictionaries, cleaned up the clutter, removed duplicates, used AI to revise, and manually reviewed as many definitions as possible.</p>\n<p><strong>Here\u2019s what makes this app stand out:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>250,000+ unique words</li>\n<li>Fully offline access</li>\n<li>The most comprehensive synonym and antonym search found on any app or website</li>\n<li>In-depth etymology and word history</li>\n<li>Multi-platform compatibility for iPhone, iPad, and Mac (Apple silicon only)</li>\n<li>iCloud sync for your saved words across all devices</li>\n<li>Integrated flashcard system for studying</li>\n<li>Specialized vocabulary sections for ACT, SAT, and GRE preparation that provide exposure to new words</li>\n<li>Modern user interface utilizing the full capabilities of SwiftUI</li>\n<li>Includes slang and curse words</li>\n<li>IPA pronunciation</li>\n<li>Export options (e.g., load saved words into Anki)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>A quick comparison of other English dictionary apps:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wordbook-universal/id364030280\">WordBook</a>: Great app and my previous go-to, but it lacks a Mac version, flashcards, and word antonyms. That was a dealbreaker for me.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lookup-dictionary-learn-daily/id872564448\">LookUp</a>: A beautifully designed app, but requires a subscription and doesn\u2019t sync saved words across devices. Also lacks offline access and rich synonyms/antonyms.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wordweb-dictionary/id309627313\">WordWeb</a>: Basic definitions with no antonyms, no sync, and no Mac version.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dictionary/id379450383\">The Free Dictionary</a>: Outdated interface and no Mac app.</p>\n<p>Merriam-Webster,\u00a0<a href=\"http://dictionary.com/\">Dictionary.com</a>, Oxford: Quality definitions, but the ads are insane, and the subscription fees are equally ridiculous. Additionally, they all require online access, and they don\u2019t have Mac apps for syncing favorites.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Please use the app and enjoy! If you find it helpful, I'd appreciate it if you could leave a review and help spread the word. :)</strong></p>\n<p><em>*I do want to point out that I specifically optimized this app to be used on Macs. My purpose for creating one app version for all three platforms (iOS, iPadOS, macOS) was so that I can maintain one codebase and still distribute to the 3 platforms. Yet, within the Swift code itself I am performing checks to verify when the app is running on iOS, iPadOs, or macOS, so that I can perform actions and behaviors to best suit the device running it.</em>\u00a0</p>",

For some context, I was onboarded as an early beta user for this app and I have been a huge fan since the very beginning. As they're gearing up for a launch, I just wanted to share this app before it becomes paid to anyone who wants to use it (currently it's free). It's this really cool voice dictation tool that is unlike others because:</p>\n<p>It has a very very low latency.</p>\n<p>It structures your writing. So, if you're writing a blob of text, it's going to make it into well-formatted text (be it bullet points or paragraphs).</p>\n<p>It understands different languages. So, if I'm talking in say Spanish, and I ask it to translate it to English after finishing, it's going to convert it to that. It also fixes your grammar, making work go by a lot faster.</p>\n<p>I use it for a lot of my work simply to organize meetings. Realized that a lot of my friends who also ended up picking up the app said was it just makes you a lot more productive and efficient because when you don't have to stress about writing or typing, you're not as stingy with your words, which means you can explain and define things better. And in that you also communicate properly, which means work gets done faster.</p>\n<p>Don't know when the launch is, but I think it's going to happen in the next 1-2 months. Because they've been sending a lot of user interviews for it. But yeah, Now is a good time to download if you are looking to save a bunch of hours every day AND I like it because of the convenience of it all. I think there's a waitlist but they usually gets you off the waitlist in under a day.</p>\n<p>here's the link: <a href=\"https://www.flowvoice.ai\">https://www.flowvoice.ai</a></p>",

I reenabled the notch on my MacBook, which I had turned off with Better Monitor. The installation was straightforward, requiring access to the camera, microphone and Apple Events.  </p>\n<p>NotchNook has two feature areas, the nook and the file tray. The nook is where the widgets are located. The currently supported widgets are media controls, shortcuts, calendar and mirror. There is a placeholder for notes, but it is not currently active. The media control widget offered to start Apple Music or YouTube. Once I opened Apple Music, the controls were no different than what is already available in Control Center with the exception of being able to use gestures to move between songs. You can add two shortcuts to the nook, but they do not support drag and drop nor do they act on files selected in the Finder rendering the usefulness limited.The calendar displays the current day and two days prior and after that. There is no way to choose a default calendar and when I added events to my system default calendar, they did not appear. The mirror widget displays an image from your built-in camera that is the literal size of a postage stamp with no way to enlarge it. I did not find it useful.  </p>\n<p>The second feature area is the file tray. It serves as a place to drag and keep files. Once you have a file there, there are no options to perform other actions, like compression or moving to cloud storage apps or any kind of image modification actions. It is strictly a holding area. There is a place holder that states additional file actions are coming, but as of now, they do not exist.  </p>\n<p>Because of the lack of depth on the features, I do not recommend purchasing this app right now. <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dropover-easier-drag-drop/id1355679052?mt=12a\">Dropover</a>, $5.99 app provides a huge variety of file actions. You can use Control Center for media control and add shortcuts to your dock or menu bar natively. If you still want to try Notch Nook, you can get it <a href=\"https://lo.cafe/notchnook\">on the developer's website.</a> Currently you can get a %35 discount if you tweet about the app.</p><div><br></div><img src=\"https://i.redd.it/0us93c17wlgd1.jpeg\" />",

You can install if by <a href=\"https://github.com/ejbills/DockDoor\">downloading it from GitHub</a> or through Homebrew. Once you have it installed and running with the proper permissions, you will see a pop-up preview of the apps window (or windows) when you hover over the app in the dock, regardless of where you place the dock in your workspace. I have mine on the left side of the screen.</p>\n<p>If you choose to use it, the included window switcher moves between open Windows (not just between apps like the macOS default). I already use an app for window switching (Alt+Tab) and have it configured with shortcuts I like so I turned off this functionality in DockDoor.</p>\n<p>When you activate DockDoor from the dock, four traffic light buttons appear in the window pop-up, each with a different function.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\ud83d\udfe3 Quit the window's app. You can hold the Option (\u2325) key while clicking to f<strong>orce</strong> quit.</li>\n<li>\ud83d\udd34 Close the window</li>\n<li>\ud83d\udfe1 Minimize the window</li>\n<li>\ud83d\udfe2 Enter the window to full screen</li>\n</ul>\n<p>DockDoor is highly customizable as seen in the preference windows below.</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/e7ndcksttudd1.jpg?width=1650&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f8f81ad775e165c4fb3b8a23aaab54b8c5cf903b</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/6or65urwtudd1.jpg?width=1656&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2eca6c731c5f4ca3549280ee53e148e2beb88c50</p>",

Your feedback and support means a lot.</p>\n<p>LookAway 1.6.0 is now released and here's what's new:</p>\n<h1>Work Schedule</h1>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/32cgsk8psocd1.png?width=1317&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e562500cd5ba245abc65b48ca5108c942e167b7</p>\n<p>Setting a work schedule in LookAway has been the most requested feature since the launch. You can now set a schedule and LookAway will only suggest breaks during those hours.</p>\n<h1>Custom Durations</h1>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/36k6gwtysocd1.png?width=1339&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f00b8ea6271445339f40e904263c0e7c095ca20</p>\n<p>You can now set custom durations for everything in the settings - including the idle time thresholds.</p>\n<h1>And more...</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>LookAway now correctly detects any new cameras or mics that are connected while LookAway is already running. This makes the meeting detection even better.  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Long break cycle is now reset when you cross your idle time reset threshold instead of focus time.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Thank you!</h1>\n<p>Also, I am offering a 40% discount on all license options for a limited time. You can use the code MACAPPS40OFF at checkout to get a discount. The code will expire after 48 hours.</p>\n<p>And that's all! Thanks for reading, and helping me make LookAway better everyday. Please keep your feedback coming - it helps a lot!</p>",

I open-sourced something I worked on the past month. The application should show the state of an active ethernet connection as a cute little icon in your menu bar. When I switched from a Windows workstation to a Mac mini, I noticed that there is no such icon. The other menubar apps I found were either paid or did not integrate that well into the macOS look &amp; feel. Thats why I quickly developed something on my own.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/yeahitsjan/WiredBuddy\">https://github.com/yeahitsjan/WiredBuddy</a></p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/tnoj87xa2w9d1.png?width=320&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c7e347b332c1ddc0345cba47425610d66515e68d</p>\n<p>The app is currently not released as binary as I still implement some features, including a cool cute AppIcon as well as localization. There will be some pushes rapidly the next time, but you can still try it out and give some feedback that will fit into the active development of this little app. It's free forever and MIT licensed ;-)</p>",

I've said for a while now that one of the goals of <a href=\"https://monarchlauncher.com\">Monarch</a> is to combine the best functionality of the best launchers. And one of the things people ask for a lot is LaunchBar's Instant Send / Universal Actions from Alfred. This update delivers on that!</p>\n<p>For those new to Monarch, you can think of it as a launcher to make everything easier and more intuitive on your Mac by providing as polished a user experience as possible. Just some highlights:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Really thorough Clipboard History, allowing you to filter by application, search by link metadata &amp; webpage titles, multi-select, etc. (unlimited clipboard history, of course).</li>\n<li>Fully keyboard driven Audio Controller with \"Set Audio Device\" command, also allowing you to save output + input device combinations as audio presets. Perfect for use during zoom calls.</li>\n<li>Floating Notes-style mode that lets you take notes with simple markdown. Comes up seamlessly, even over fullscreen. (\u2318+dot by default)</li>\n<li>Link to anything with <a href=\"https://manual.monarchlauncher.com/superlinks\">Superlinks</a>, <em>significantly</em> more powerful than Quicklinks in Raycast allowing you to have fallback links, match checks, reorder parameters, custom icons, auto triggers etc.</li>\n<li>Custom themes + in-app theme editor.</li>\n<li>Zero telemetry, zero data collection, zero email marketing, 100% user-supported.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Having said all that, there's still a long way to go, and I will say one more time that the project was opened to the public only in February of this year. But I hope that you can imagine what Monarch looks like this time next year, or 2, 5, or 10 years from now. This isn't a major update though, the next major update will be Monarch AI, which I'm quite excited for as I think that every AI app is going about AI in the wrong way, so I want to demo something new there!</p>\n<p>Monarch is updated at a blistering pace, but only thanks to the support you provide, thank you!</p>\n<p>Feel free to join the <a href=\"https://discord.gg/4aysbQVjus\">Discord</a>, so much of what's going into Monarch gets shaped there, but I try to comment on the <a href=\"https://monarchlauncher.featurebase.app/\">roadmap</a> as much as possible.</p>\n<p>Note: As of right now, you can't create your own custom actions for Monarch's Instant Send, but some of the groundwork for that is laid with this update, depending on how it is received, and it is something I want to do.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://monarchlauncher.com\">Link to Monarch website &amp; more info</a></p>\n<p>Some questions that come up:</p>\n<p><strong>What's the difference between Luna/Freya licenses?</strong><br />\nLuna license is a lifetime license that will have access to all versions of Monarch from 1.0 to 2.0, 3.0 and beyond, for 0 upgrade costs for the rest of ever. Freya licenses will be similar to CleanShot X licenses in that you can optionally upgrade for a small fee.</p>\n<p><strong>Are there student discounts?</strong><br />\nYes -- 25% off for students outside NY/NJ, 40% for students inside NY/NJ because I really want to support the local developer scene here where I live. Email me at <a href=\"mailto:rmdashrfv@hey.com\">rmdashrfv@hey.com</a> for a code.</p>\n<p><strong>Is there a bundle deal?</strong><br />\nYes, buy one get one 50% off (for a limited time).</p>\n<p><strong>When are you adding Monarch to Homebrew?</strong><br />\nHopefully the end of this week. I really hope.</p>",

I've discovered new apps that have improved my quality of life and my productivity, and sometimes even learned new use cases for apps that I previously had. I think I check this place daily just to stay up to date on cool apps and news related to apps in general.</p>\n<p>I decided to share a list of the apps that I've discovered here. Even though none of this information is new, if this helps just 1 person discover a useful app at some point, I'll feel satisfied! Every app has alternatives, and I don't think my app choices are inherently better than others, but the list below is what I use and have personally felt has been helpful.</p>\n<p>Honestly, this list covers most apps I have on my mac. I have other software on my mac, but they aren't really the focus of this post (e.g. Office, Ableton, Todoist, etc). I hope some of these utilities help you if you haven't heard of them.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Alfred:</strong> Intially I just used this as a spotlight replacement to search for files and launch apps, but through this forum I learned more about workflows and it has been so helpful! Personally four things are very useful for me (other than searching for stuff and navigating folders): 1Password workflow (searching and opening passwords via Alfred it quick and gains me time; I do simple math directly in Alfred, save me a lot of time opening a calculator; launching applications and webpages via hotkeys; clipboard history (I don't need anything fancy, just checking what I copied a couples of times ago is enough for me).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Bartender:</strong> Despite all the discussion that recently happened, this is still an app that is very useful for me. Hasving my menubar organized and only the most important menu bar items showing is simply amazing on a notched MacBook. I just use Little Snitch to block connections and that's good enough for me.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>BusyCal:</strong> I used to be so frustrated that the native calendar app sometimes didn't sync my events properly across all my devices. Sometimes I would create a meeting on my iPhone or my Mac and it would not show on the other device and cause me to miss something important. BusyCal has solved that for me. I haven't used it for long, but so far I am happy.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>CleanShotX:</strong> This has been simply amazing for my screenshot needs. The all-in-one feature has been useful, and especially the scrolling capture when I need to take a long screenshot of something to include in a report.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>CoconutBattery:</strong> I feel like it represents my battery life more accurately.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Command X:</strong> This fixed the so annoying problem for me of not being able to simply cut a file with command + x. Something so simple but so useful</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Crossover:</strong> Being able to install windows games without needing something like Parralels?? Brilliant! This has allowed me to play Diablo 4 smoothly on my Mac and for that alone I am grateful (I am a long time Diablo fan).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Dato:</strong> Receiving in your face notifications of a meeting is great. Sometimes I am in deep work and simply forget that I have something scheduled or don't even notice the smaller notifications of an upcoming meeting.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>DefaultFolderX:</strong> Honestly, being able to quickly navigate my folder structure and access recent items via my menubar it what I like most about this. This has been helpful to check some folders without having to access finder.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Dropover:</strong> Wow, I didn't know I needed this until I had it. If you work with a lot of files like me, then being able to park your files temporarily in such an elegant implementation is great. No more needing to switch between multiple finder tabs to move stuff.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fluor:</strong> Being able to choose which applications the F keys act like F keys is a lifesaver. Mainly being able to have them act like F keys in excel is what I use this for. That alone is worth it for me.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Hazel:</strong> I didn't even know I needed this. I download a lot of mp3 files for my DJing hobby and having them sorted into folders after I go on a song downloading spree is great. I use Hazel for other small things as well. It does feel like a luxury more than a necessity for me, but I enjoy it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Hyperkey:</strong> Abosultely brilliant being able to use my caps lock key as a hyperkey. I use the caps lock as my hyperkey to map certain apps and webpages to keys and launch via Alfred.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Little Snitch:</strong> I feel much more in control of my security, and using blocklists is a lifesaver. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Lunar:</strong> Works great to manage my external monitor. I love autosynicng of the brightness of my monitors and being able to control both with the F keys. I feel like I am in more control of my mac brightness. I haven't tried any other apps and don't feel like I need to.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>MacUpdater:</strong> I lived so long without this and can't believe I did. Auto updating EVERY app my mac has on autopilot has cured my OCD of checking for updates all the time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Micro Snitch:</strong> I love the visual indicator that my camera is on or my microphone is on. I have forgotten and said stuff stuff before in a meeting lol.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Meeter:</strong> Meetings launcher on my menu bar. Very handy. Still not sure if BusyCal can replace this.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Mos:</strong> Simple small app to fix my mouse being inverted. I couldn't get Logi's software to work for some reason and this fixed it for me.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>One Switch:</strong> I love having multiple functions one click away in my menu bar. I mostly use Screen Clean, Keep Awake, and Eject Disk.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Popclip:</strong> Such a great app that I only discovered recently. Performing searchers, pasting matching destination formatting, saving to notes and some text formatting options have been helpful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Swish:</strong> This is one of the apps I love the most. The gestures are so good and feel native. Would gladly buy it again given the amount of satisfaction it gives me.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Wins:</strong> I use this solely to enable previewing multiple windows of an app in the dock. This is probably the only feature I truly miss from Windows after all these years.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Bonus:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Accelerator Keys:</strong> This app I don't think I discovered here, in fact I rarely see it mentioned, but being a heavy excel user and doing a lot of modeling, this is indispensable for me.</li>\n</ul>",

It\u2019s like having a personal coach who offers tips right after each call.</p>\n<p>Here is an example of the feedback:</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/gx9tyhuxxi8d1.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df1c7f3d15f60594a9390bed823b0bfae2335f74</p>\n<p><strong>How Did I Come Up with the Idea?</strong></p>\n<p>As a non-native English speaker I often made little mistakes during calls which sometimes led to awkward moments. Despite my decent grasp of English these errors were persistent.</p>\n<p>My background as an ML engineer got me thinking: What if AI could track and highlight my common mistakes, and assist me in correcting them? That\u2019s how Fluently was born.</p>\n<p><strong>How Fluently</strong>\u00a0<strong>works:</strong></p>\n<p>Right now, Fluently is an app for MacOS.
