Your feedback and support means a lot.</p>\n<p>LookAway 1.6.0 is now released and here's what's new:</p>\n<h1>Work Schedule</h1>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/32cgsk8psocd1.png?width=1317&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e562500cd5ba245abc65b48ca5108c942e167b7</p>\n<p>Setting a work schedule in LookAway has been the most requested feature since the launch. You can now set a schedule and LookAway will only suggest breaks during those hours.</p>\n<h1>Custom Durations</h1>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/36k6gwtysocd1.png?width=1339&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f00b8ea6271445339f40e904263c0e7c095ca20</p>\n<p>You can now set custom durations for everything in the settings - including the idle time thresholds.</p>\n<h1>And more...</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>LookAway now correctly detects any new cameras or mics that are connected while LookAway is already running. This makes the meeting detection even better.  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Long break cycle is now reset when you cross your idle time reset threshold instead of focus time.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Thank you!</h1>\n<p>Also, I am offering a 40% discount on all license options for a limited time. You can use the code MACAPPS40OFF at checkout to get a discount. The code will expire after 48 hours.</p>\n<p>And that's all! Thanks for reading, and helping me make LookAway better everyday. Please keep your feedback coming - it helps a lot!</p>",

I open-sourced something I worked on the past month. The application should show the state of an active ethernet connection as a cute little icon in your menu bar. When I switched from a Windows workstation to a Mac mini, I noticed that there is no such icon. The other menubar apps I found were either paid or did not integrate that well into the macOS look &amp; feel. Thats why I quickly developed something on my own.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/yeahitsjan/WiredBuddy\">https://github.com/yeahitsjan/WiredBuddy</a></p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/tnoj87xa2w9d1.png?width=320&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c7e347b332c1ddc0345cba47425610d66515e68d</p>\n<p>The app is currently not released as binary as I still implement some features, including a cool cute AppIcon as well as localization. There will be some pushes rapidly the next time, but you can still try it out and give some feedback that will fit into the active development of this little app. It's free forever and MIT licensed ;-)</p>",

I've said for a while now that one of the goals of <a href=\"https://monarchlauncher.com\">Monarch</a> is to combine the best functionality of the best launchers. And one of the things people ask for a lot is LaunchBar's Instant Send / Universal Actions from Alfred. This update delivers on that!</p>\n<p>For those new to Monarch, you can think of it as a launcher to make everything easier and more intuitive on your Mac by providing as polished a user experience as possible. Just some highlights:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Really thorough Clipboard History, allowing you to filter by application, search by link metadata &amp; webpage titles, multi-select, etc. (unlimited clipboard history, of course).</li>\n<li>Fully keyboard driven Audio Controller with \"Set Audio Device\" command, also allowing you to save output + input device combinations as audio presets. Perfect for use during zoom calls.</li>\n<li>Floating Notes-style mode that lets you take notes with simple markdown. Comes up seamlessly, even over fullscreen. (\u2318+dot by default)</li>\n<li>Link to anything with <a href=\"https://manual.monarchlauncher.com/superlinks\">Superlinks</a>, <em>significantly</em> more powerful than Quicklinks in Raycast allowing you to have fallback links, match checks, reorder parameters, custom icons, auto triggers etc.</li>\n<li>Custom themes + in-app theme editor.</li>\n<li>Zero telemetry, zero data collection, zero email marketing, 100% user-supported.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Having said all that, there's still a long way to go, and I will say one more time that the project was opened to the public only in February of this year. But I hope that you can imagine what Monarch looks like this time next year, or 2, 5, or 10 years from now. This isn't a major update though, the next major update will be Monarch AI, which I'm quite excited for as I think that every AI app is going about AI in the wrong way, so I want to demo something new there!</p>\n<p>Monarch is updated at a blistering pace, but only thanks to the support you provide, thank you!</p>\n<p>Feel free to join the <a href=\"https://discord.gg/4aysbQVjus\">Discord</a>, so much of what's going into Monarch gets shaped there, but I try to comment on the <a href=\"https://monarchlauncher.featurebase.app/\">roadmap</a> as much as possible.</p>\n<p>Note: As of right now, you can't create your own custom actions for Monarch's Instant Send, but some of the groundwork for that is laid with this update, depending on how it is received, and it is something I want to do.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://monarchlauncher.com\">Link to Monarch website &amp; more info</a></p>\n<p>Some questions that come up:</p>\n<p><strong>What's the difference between Luna/Freya licenses?</strong><br />\nLuna license is a lifetime license that will have access to all versions of Monarch from 1.0 to 2.0, 3.0 and beyond, for 0 upgrade costs for the rest of ever. Freya licenses will be similar to CleanShot X licenses in that you can optionally upgrade for a small fee.</p>\n<p><strong>Are there student discounts?</strong><br />\nYes -- 25% off for students outside NY/NJ, 40% for students inside NY/NJ because I really want to support the local developer scene here where I live. Email me at <a href=\"mailto:rmdashrfv@hey.com\">rmdashrfv@hey.com</a> for a code.</p>\n<p><strong>Is there a bundle deal?</strong><br />\nYes, buy one get one 50% off (for a limited time).</p>\n<p><strong>When are you adding Monarch to Homebrew?</strong><br />\nHopefully the end of this week. I really hope.</p>",

I've discovered new apps that have improved my quality of life and my productivity, and sometimes even learned new use cases for apps that I previously had. I think I check this place daily just to stay up to date on cool apps and news related to apps in general.</p>\n<p>I decided to share a list of the apps that I've discovered here. Even though none of this information is new, if this helps just 1 person discover a useful app at some point, I'll feel satisfied! Every app has alternatives, and I don't think my app choices are inherently better than others, but the list below is what I use and have personally felt has been helpful.</p>\n<p>Honestly, this list covers most apps I have on my mac. I have other software on my mac, but they aren't really the focus of this post (e.g. Office, Ableton, Todoist, etc). I hope some of these utilities help you if you haven't heard of them.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Alfred:</strong> Intially I just used this as a spotlight replacement to search for files and launch apps, but through this forum I learned more about workflows and it has been so helpful! Personally four things are very useful for me (other than searching for stuff and navigating folders): 1Password workflow (searching and opening passwords via Alfred it quick and gains me time; I do simple math directly in Alfred, save me a lot of time opening a calculator; launching applications and webpages via hotkeys; clipboard history (I don't need anything fancy, just checking what I copied a couples of times ago is enough for me).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Bartender:</strong> Despite all the discussion that recently happened, this is still an app that is very useful for me. Hasving my menubar organized and only the most important menu bar items showing is simply amazing on a notched MacBook. I just use Little Snitch to block connections and that's good enough for me.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>BusyCal:</strong> I used to be so frustrated that the native calendar app sometimes didn't sync my events properly across all my devices. Sometimes I would create a meeting on my iPhone or my Mac and it would not show on the other device and cause me to miss something important. BusyCal has solved that for me. I haven't used it for long, but so far I am happy.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>CleanShotX:</strong> This has been simply amazing for my screenshot needs. The all-in-one feature has been useful, and especially the scrolling capture when I need to take a long screenshot of something to include in a report.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>CoconutBattery:</strong> I feel like it represents my battery life more accurately.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Command X:</strong> This fixed the so annoying problem for me of not being able to simply cut a file with command + x. Something so simple but so useful</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Crossover:</strong> Being able to install windows games without needing something like Parralels?? Brilliant! This has allowed me to play Diablo 4 smoothly on my Mac and for that alone I am grateful (I am a long time Diablo fan).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Dato:</strong> Receiving in your face notifications of a meeting is great. Sometimes I am in deep work and simply forget that I have something scheduled or don't even notice the smaller notifications of an upcoming meeting.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>DefaultFolderX:</strong> Honestly, being able to quickly navigate my folder structure and access recent items via my menubar it what I like most about this. This has been helpful to check some folders without having to access finder.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Dropover:</strong> Wow, I didn't know I needed this until I had it. If you work with a lot of files like me, then being able to park your files temporarily in such an elegant implementation is great. No more needing to switch between multiple finder tabs to move stuff.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fluor:</strong> Being able to choose which applications the F keys act like F keys is a lifesaver. Mainly being able to have them act like F keys in excel is what I use this for. That alone is worth it for me.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Hazel:</strong> I didn't even know I needed this. I download a lot of mp3 files for my DJing hobby and having them sorted into folders after I go on a song downloading spree is great. I use Hazel for other small things as well. It does feel like a luxury more than a necessity for me, but I enjoy it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Hyperkey:</strong> Abosultely brilliant being able to use my caps lock key as a hyperkey. I use the caps lock as my hyperkey to map certain apps and webpages to keys and launch via Alfred.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Little Snitch:</strong> I feel much more in control of my security, and using blocklists is a lifesaver. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Lunar:</strong> Works great to manage my external monitor. I love autosynicng of the brightness of my monitors and being able to control both with the F keys. I feel like I am in more control of my mac brightness. I haven't tried any other apps and don't feel like I need to.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>MacUpdater:</strong> I lived so long without this and can't believe I did. Auto updating EVERY app my mac has on autopilot has cured my OCD of checking for updates all the time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Micro Snitch:</strong> I love the visual indicator that my camera is on or my microphone is on. I have forgotten and said stuff stuff before in a meeting lol.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Meeter:</strong> Meetings launcher on my menu bar. Very handy. Still not sure if BusyCal can replace this.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Mos:</strong> Simple small app to fix my mouse being inverted. I couldn't get Logi's software to work for some reason and this fixed it for me.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>One Switch:</strong> I love having multiple functions one click away in my menu bar. I mostly use Screen Clean, Keep Awake, and Eject Disk.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Popclip:</strong> Such a great app that I only discovered recently. Performing searchers, pasting matching destination formatting, saving to notes and some text formatting options have been helpful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Swish:</strong> This is one of the apps I love the most. The gestures are so good and feel native. Would gladly buy it again given the amount of satisfaction it gives me.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Wins:</strong> I use this solely to enable previewing multiple windows of an app in the dock. This is probably the only feature I truly miss from Windows after all these years.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Bonus:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Accelerator Keys:</strong> This app I don't think I discovered here, in fact I rarely see it mentioned, but being a heavy excel user and doing a lot of modeling, this is indispensable for me.</li>\n</ul>",

It\u2019s like having a personal coach who offers tips right after each call.</p>\n<p>Here is an example of the feedback:</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/gx9tyhuxxi8d1.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df1c7f3d15f60594a9390bed823b0bfae2335f74</p>\n<p><strong>How Did I Come Up with the Idea?</strong></p>\n<p>As a non-native English speaker I often made little mistakes during calls which sometimes led to awkward moments. Despite my decent grasp of English these errors were persistent.</p>\n<p>My background as an ML engineer got me thinking: What if AI could track and highlight my common mistakes, and assist me in correcting them? That\u2019s how Fluently was born.</p>\n<p><strong>How Fluently</strong>\u00a0<strong>works:</strong></p>\n<p>Right now, Fluently is an app for MacOS. Just download it and follow these three easy steps to start improving:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Start the app:</strong>\u00a0Fluently starts when you speak English during online meetings</li>\n<li><strong>Get feedback:</strong>\u00a0After each call Fluently gives you feedback tailored to your language challenges: it finds mistakes and tells you how to do better</li>\n<li><strong>Track progress:</strong>\u00a0Over time you can see where you\u2019re getting better and where you still need practice</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Fluently makes learning easier and boosts confidence for people like me who need to speak English well on their daily calls.</p>\n<p><strong>What Makes Fluently Unique?</strong></p>\n<p>Unlike generic language learning tools, Fluently provides feedback based on the language you use daily. Here are some of our key benefits and features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Real-life feedback</strong>: Helps fix mistakes from real calls, not just in classrooms</li>\n<li><strong>Easy learning</strong>: No extra time needed \u2013 just learn from your usual meetings</li>\n<li><strong>English Level Assessment:</strong>\u00a0Fluently will evaluate your English level and figure out the strongest and weakest parts</li>\n<li><strong>AI Tutor:</strong>\u00a0To practice English when you don\u2019t have calls</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/6jyvi2o0yi8d1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d6d56a00bc6fa847c020c2287b7723c8814a6321\">Try Fluently to evaluate your English level in 4 mins</a></p>\n<p>I just released the app afrer closed beta and hope you will enjoy it!</p>\n<p>Got questions or feedback?

The app does support Celsius, Fahrenheit, 12/24 hour time format and you can make the dynamic gradients based on the weather just a single colour for accessibility. Some gradients (I know) make some text hard to see, especially in snowy conditions but I\u2019m getting around to fixing that. </p>\n<p>Hope you like it! </p>",

The idea was to build something that could capture and index digital activity, making it easy to remember and find information later.</p>\n<p>After months of hard work, I finally got Recall to a point where it was working well. I've managed to ask him for information on my activity  from a week ago with details and all that locally with local llms! It was exciting to see it come together and actually do what I hoped it would.</p>\n<p>But then, I found out yesterday that the new Copilot+ laptops have a feature called \"Recall\" that does pretty much the same thing but better. It was a bit of a shock. Here I was, thinking I had something unique, only to see it already out there in a big way.</p>\n<p>So, now I'm not sure what to think. Instead of giving up, I decided to open-source Recall and rename it reMind. I believe that by sharing it, maybe some of you might have ideas or want to help improve it. If you\u2019re interested, I\u2019d love to hear from you!</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s the GitHub link: <a href=\"https://github.com/DonTizi/ReMind/\">Github Repo</a></p>\n<p>Best,</p>",

For more information, here's our <a href=\"https://discord.gg/8aA7JRkEmQ\">discord</a>.</p>\n<p>Mythic is the best and easiest way to sort all of your games in one place, whether those games are Windows or macOS-based.  It comes with <strong>epic games support</strong> right out of the box (and <strong>steam support in the future</strong>), but if that doesn't quite meet your needs, you can always <strong>manually import</strong> your games into the launcher.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/vieav1ccca1d1.png?width=2302&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e69d2a37016c643e95d35d2499337aef517711b\">A screenshot of Mythic doing its thing!

When I'm in the toilet, I found my app at number 5 ranking on the App Store (Productivity), and I was shocked. But I thought, how is that possible? Is it a bug!? So, I went to App Store Connect and found that it shows 'Not Enough Data' I have to wait until the data is available. </p>\n<p>No matter what the outcome, I'm okay with launching my app. It's alright for me, even if things don't turn out as expected. </p>\n<p>It's an all-in-one note-taking app that allows you to store a variety of notes in one place, including Events, Reminders, Notes, Journals, Timers, Stopwatches, Logs, and Bookmarks. All saved as files. No need for a server and you can have as many files as you want. And you can put the files on iCloud Drive to sync your data across all your Apple devices, your notes are always accessible. </p>\n<p>I've made it a one-time purchase because I believe in fair pricing and transparency. I've funded this app entirely on my own, without any VC backing, and I'm committed to never collecting and selling your data.</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/qlfqqfdqcz0d1.jpg?width=563&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba1274eb7eb766061eac8b0d20994930d8e90ae5</p>\n<p>There are many more features to come and plenty of room fr improvement.

This will help you beat those questions to the punch and will show that you've done some amount of market research first. </p>\n<p>Also, please be careful with subscriptions; I understand that app development is costly and subscriptions are the new hotness, but on this subreddit, we are weary of subscriptions for many reasons. If your model can allow for it, always try to consider the POV of someone who'd like a one-time purchase. I understand this can get tricky with the ever-popular AI wrappers. Suggestion? If your app is bundling API access into its monthly cost, try to investigate whether a BYOK (bring your own API key) is an option. </p>\n<p>This is just friendly advice from someone who loves to try new apps. Keep building, and keep coming up with new stuff, I love seeing it!</p>",

I\u2019m trying to figure out what app I can use to make a Photo Album/Collage that I can print by myself on a US Letter Paper. The apps I see when I search the Mac AppStore redirects to third party printing services that deliver the finished product to you.</p>\n<p>Previously when I was using MS Office on Windows, it was easy since all I had to do was use the Insert-Photo Album option and I can select how many photos per page I need. This was available on Word and PowerPoint. I didn\u2019t know this option was never available for Office on Mac, until I tried to find the feature for a document I\u2019m working on.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s the Media-Image Gallery route with Pages but it puts all photos (and can caption it) in one page that you have to flip one by one but it only prints the Photo on the foreground of the gallery. I know I can drag drop those photos into Office or Pages but we\u2019re looking at close to a thousand photos that I have to format and caption so anything that can make the job easy would help.</p>\n<p>I appreciate any recommendations, Paid or Free. Thanks!</p>",

I'd love to hear your thoughts and feedback on it, as your input means the world to me \ud83d\ude0a.</p>\n<p>So, let me give you a quick rundown of what the app does: It allows you to create custom folder icons by selecting your preferred color and optionally, an icon to accompany it. Once you've made your selections and hit the generate button, the app creates an image that you can use to replace any folder icon on your device. Pretty neat, right?</p>\n<p>I'm really excited about this project and can't wait to hear what you all think!

You had to download it from a website, and many of them suddenly stopped working over the years.</p>\n<p>You would also see the confusing workflow charts of each workflow and understand where you need to add the hotkey or when to update it.</p>\n<p>But with Raycast, I installed all my favorite extensions from the Raycast command line within minutes.</p>\n<p>The extension table clearly shows how to set up hotkeys and aliases for every action.</p>\n<p>Setting it up was a fun and easy experience.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><strong>New Features</strong></p>\n<p>Here are some of the new extensions I\u2019ve installed that I didn\u2019t find on Alfred:</p>\n<p>My Schedule: Raycast connects to my calendar and gives me a quick rundown of my events.</p>\n<p>Smart Converter / Calculator: this feature can perform all the basic calculator tasks but also tell you the date \u201c5 months from now\u201d and how much are 50 dollars in euros. Very handy.</p>\n<p>AirPods connector: Alfred has one, but it broke for me several times, and I couldn\u2019t get it to work. Raycast\u2019s one works seamlessly. I can connect my AirPods by typing Command+P.</p>\n<p>Translate: Alfred's \u201ctranslate\u201d workflow sends you to the web. Raycast one translates everything within the app itself.</p>\n<p>Floating Notes: show and hide cool-looking sticky notes.</p>\n<p>Raycast also offers AI capabilities for those willing to pay for the \u201cPro\u201d subscription, but I haven\u2019t tried it yet.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>(P.s my full post is <a href=\"https://simplyproductive.substack.com/p/why-im-switching-from-alfred-to-raycast\">here</a>)</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>What do you think?

I also do some checking to see whether the app is shady (though I am by no means a security expert so most of this is low-level checks, and by reading reviews etc.). You should do your own due diligence and check the app and its source. I can help with troubleshooting but you should always know and understand what you're installing on your machine!</p>\n<h1>Your suggestions</h1>\n<p>In the past I have said suggestions should be put in the comments here, but I think a better process will be the use of Issues on GitHub. If you don't have GitHub, feel free to comment, and I will make issues for you and reply to you with them. The GitHub is here</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>GitHub</strong> - <a href=\"https://github.com/jamesjingyi/free-mac-apps\">Free Mac Apps</a>   </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/jamesjingyi/free-mac-apps\">^(https://github.com/jamesjingyi/free-mac-apps)</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'm doing this for the following reasons: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>It's much easier for me to manage (lists where I can cross things off are good, and give me endorphins!)</li>\n<li>It'll reduce people recommending the same thing, rather people can 'second' recommendations in GitHub (it's hard to scroll through lots of Reddit comments, especially if you find this post later!)</li>\n<li>I would like to encourage discussion based on other people's experiences, not just my testing, so having them here will allow people to discuss alternatives, issues, etc</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If anyone has any recommendations about a better solution, please let me know! At the moment I am retaining the only editing control of the Google Sheet, but this might change in the future, and of course you can make a copy and use it yourself - I am not precious about any of this stuff, I just want people to know about them!</p>\n<h1>What about the Master Lists?</h1>\n<p>This by no means replaces (or is meant to replace) the excellent work done on the Master Lists in the /r/macapps subreddit. Those provide excellent and well thought out comparisons, they just don't focus on free/open source, which is why my list differs slightly. </p>\n<p>If you are looking for the best app, you should definitely look there - I don't really provide that many alternatives, as I find a solution and recommend that. You may also be willing to pay for certain things (I certainly pay for certain software because it is better or not available for free), and my list will not cover those.</p>\n<p>The Master Lists are here:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Reddit</strong> - <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/macapps/comments/18kpzy5/master_list_of_definitive_app_comparisons_view/\">Master List of Definitive App Comparisons - View and Contribute - 2024 Update</a>  </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/macapps/comments/18kpzy5/master_list_of_definitive_app_comparisons_view/\">^(https://www.reddit.com/r/macapps/comments/18kpzy5/master_list_of_definitive_app_comparisons_view/)</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>Happy installing!</p>",

I know there is still a lot of room for improvement, but it has definitely become more stable over time.</p>\n<p>Picview is a simple image viewer that supports opening photos with a double click, then using arrow keys to flip through images or scrolling with your mouse wheel to zoom. The user experience has a very Windows-like feel and makes viewing photos more convenient than the native options.</p>\n<p>It supports over 30 file formats including PNG, JPG, WEBP and CR3. Viewing features include automatically scrolling long images into view and providing features like image slideshows, fullscreen immersive viewing.</p>\n<p>Picview is free to download and use from the App Store. Users can access all of Picview's features without limits, except they will be prompted to purchase after reaching a daily usage amount. Of course, you can choose not to buy and continue using.</p>\n<p>Recently, I increased the one-time purchase price of Picview from $2 to $5. I'm not sure if this was the right decision.</p>\n<p>If you have some time and want to spend a relaxing moment enjoying photo memories, you can try out Picview and leave some feedback.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/picview-image-viewer/id6452016140\">https://apps.apple.com/us/app/picview-image-viewer/id6452016140</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://enpicview.chitaner.com\">https://enpicview.chitaner.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/vz45hjssx5gc1.jpg?width=1500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3fbe5b2475a25cf317c702b070c452684e05ca2f\">mouse zoom</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/nitz1c4xx5gc1.jpg?width=1500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33ae5fe533028b10e00377d860247b4e06d6f163\">mouse page</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/gpkbaxc0y5gc1.jpg?width=1500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d8cf2fda021cd2bf12e881190ea6f42288c6bb13\">Long image</a></p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>",

It's an app designed for effortless note-taking, resembling a chat interface to build a personal timeline. It offers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Chronological, chat-like note entry.</li>\n<li>Tagging for organization.</li>\n<li>Global shortcuts for quick access.</li>\n<li>A native Mac app look and feel.</li>\n<li>Encrypted iCloud backup &amp; synchronization.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Developing Strflow has been a fulfilling journey. There are more features I want to add, but I am satisfied with its current state. If you're interested, please visit the website, try the app, and share your thoughts!</p>\n<p>Strflow is free for unlimited notes, tags, and attachments. The Strflow Plus plan, offering encrypted iCloud backup &amp; synchronization, is available for $0.99/month or $9.99/year as a special introductory offer. This rate will be honored for subscribers who join now, as long as their subscription is continuous.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://strflow.app\">Web Site</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/strflow-notes-journal/id6468486339?l=en-US&amp;mt=12\">Mac App Store</a></p>\n<p>PS: Currently working on developing an iOS version of Strflow\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udcbb</p>",

It communicates with your router, and uses ICMP ping and traceroute to visualize your connectivity to the Internet, and show you potential bottlenecks and issues. It is highly configurable and supports industry standard SNMP and UPnP for querying routers, servers, Macs and more. Each monitor can be configured to show real-time or historical information, and output can be written to a CSV file later parsing if you wish.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/audfl7wtiv9c1.png?width=1492&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7cd6b0fd0cedfb920afd24ef4ebd2d6123ac7915\">PeakHour's Internet Dashboard, showing a real-time view of latency and throughput.</a></p>\n<p>Some key new features of PeakHour 5:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Internet Dashboard</strong>: This new feature offers a single, comprehensive view of your internet connection's health, including local, ISP, and overall internet latency.</li>\n<li><strong>Multi-Host Latency Monitoring</strong>: Now, you can monitor latency between any two internet points, like your ISP and Google, for a better understanding of connection quality and latency.</li>\n<li><strong>Local Interface Monitoring</strong>: Monitor your Mac's network interfaces directly, without additional tool\u200bs.</li>\n<li><strong>More flexible window layout</strong>: More flexibility in arranging monitors, especially useful with multiple monitor\u200bs.</li>\n<li><strong>MacOS Sonoma Compatibility</strong>: Fully updated UI to match the latest macOS advancement\u200bs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And there's more \u2013 improved ping accuracy, horizontal scroll lock, streamlined First Time Setup and lots more.</p>\n<p>You can grab it now exclusively in the Mac Appstor\u200be.
