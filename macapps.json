            "title": "After weeks of stalling and rejecting, Apple finally approved my pixel-perfect Launchpad clone!",
            "content_html": "<p>Hi everyone,</p>\n<p>A little backstory first: I started working on a Launchpad replacement right after Apple announced its removal at WWDC in June. I knew multiple clones would appear, so I wanted mine to be both the first and the most faithful to the original. Fast forward a few weeks, after solving way more challenges than I expected, I was ready to submit in August.</p>\n<p>But Apple rejected my app, saying it was \u201ctoo close to the original\u201d. I tried everything: tweaking the UI, changing screenshots and descriptions, even submitting under different app names with different strategies (e.g., showing one UI on macOS 15 and another on 26, or positioning it as a \u201cgeneric customizable launcher\u201d). Every single submission stalled or failed. Even after macOS 26 was officially released and I dropped macOS 15 support, they still insisted it \u201cduplicates the look and feel of Launchpad, included on macOS devices\u201d and I needed to \u201cdifferentiate it from existing apps.\u201d</p>\n<p>At that point, I gave up. I\u2019d already sunk too many hours on the project.</p>\n<p>But then\u2026 one of my last submissions, which had been stuck at\u00a0<em>In Review</em> for almost two weeks, suddenly flipped to\u00a0<em>Approved</em>\u00a0overnight! Maybe I had a hidden angel at Apple after all. \ud83d\ude4c</p>\n<p>So today, I\u2019m releasing\u00a0<strong>ReLaunch</strong>, my Launchpad re-implementation for macOS 26.</p>\n<p>A few technical challenges I\u2019m proud of solving:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Visual fidelity: It had to look and feel\u00a0<em>exactly</em>\u00a0like Launchpad: from the homescreen and scrolling to tricky details like hiding the Dock app-indicator dot and keeping the Dock visible while the menu bar is hidden (surprisingly hard to pull off on macOS).</li>\n<li>Fast launch: No delays. Click the ReLaunch icon and your apps are there instantly.</li>\n<li>Lean memory: It needs to stay resident for speed but remain light. My target was &lt;100 MB idle (\\~0.5% of RAM on the lowest-spec Macs), and I beat it.</li>\n<li>Robust indexing: macOS apps live in multiple places; ReLaunch efficiently indexes them and watches for changes.</li>\n<li>Room to grow: Apple\u2019s old implementation was basically frozen in time. ReLaunch creates space for optional, useful features and customizations over time without compromising the familiar feel.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What\u2019s still in progress: Drag-and-drop on the main grid. For now, there\u2019s a Settings window to quickly organize apps and folders while I make DnD feel natural. (The original Launchpad\u2019s DnD is deceptively complex: reordering across pages, distinguishing between creating a folder vs. swapping an icon into an existing slot, moving in and out of folders while the UI transitions underneath, dragging to the Dock, and more!).</p>\n<p>The one big thing still in progress is drag-and-drop on the main screen. In the original Launchpad, drag-and-drop is surprisingly complex: you can move icons across multiple screens, replacing or merging app into a folder, move into and out of folders, etc. For now, I\u2019ve added a Settings window where you can easily organize apps and folders while I work on making drag-and-drop feel natural.</p>\n<p>About the App Store page: The current screenshots and description are intentionally conservative (no \u201cLaunchpad\u201d mentions and a UI variant shown from earlier macOS) to avoid more review drama. But that\u2019s just metadata; on macOS 26 you\u2019ll get the familiar interface right away. I\u2019m holding off on updating the screenshots until I\u2019m sure I won\u2019t risk another rejection.</p>\n<p>Any feedback is very welcome! There\u2019s a\u00a0<strong>Feedback</strong>\u00a0button in ReLaunch Settings that goes straight to my personal email. I\u2019d love to hear your use cases and ideas.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/relaunch/id6752254955\">Download ReLaunch on the Mac App Store!</a></p>\n<p>(This is a repost from r/mac and r/macos since the've deleted my post)</p>",

Connections keep dropping randomly, it'll freeze mid-sentence or say it's offline even when my internet is stable. I logged out thinking maybe it's some cache issue but holy freaking airball, I couldn't log back in for three full days. No error messages, nothing, just completely locked out. And good luck getting through to support, they literally have an AI Agent that funnily enough doesn't even work half the time (I was the only one out of my friends who got a reply, see more below on friends omfg) And when the stupid AI can't help you with it's stupid obvious suggestions, it says it'll transfer to a colleague that is probably on vacation for the past week because jfc no reply. Also, their transcriptions have gotten poorer, idk if it's poor data getting into their training but just constant misses and constant failed transcriptions, lags, or the app crashing. Im so annoyed ugh.</p>\n<p>I just love the idea and I need an alternative. Please, please help me because holy, the concept is super smart.

A ton of people asked me to share more of these built-in tricks, so here\u2019s another one that\u2019s been saving me time every day and not just 30 seconds like previous post  :)</p>\n<p>Most people\u2019s <strong>Downloads folder</strong> is a mess full of screenshots, ZIP files, invoices, and old installers. Mine cleans and organizes itself behind the scenes and I barely think about it now.</p>\n<p><strong>Here\u2019s what it does for me:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Moves all images into a folder called \u201cDownloads/Images\u201d</li>\n<li>Puts PDFs into \u201cDownloads/Documents\u201d</li>\n<li>Sends ZIP files into \u201cDownloads/Archives\u201d</li>\n<li>Deletes DMG installer files after a day</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>All of this is done using a feature on macOS called Automator with a Folder Action. No apps to install and no scripts to learn.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>How to set it up (takes 2 or 3 minutes):</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1.</strong> Open the Automator app and choose <strong>New Document</strong>, then select <strong>Folder Action.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>2.</strong> At the top, choose <strong>Downloads</strong> as the folder this action watches.</p>\n<p><strong>3.</strong> From the list of actions, search and drag in <strong>Filter Finder Items.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>-</strong> Set it to: Kind is Image.</p>\n<p><strong>4.</strong> Then drag in <strong>Move Finder Items</strong> and choose the folder you want those images to go to (like Downloads/Images).</p>\n<p><strong>5.</strong> Repeat steps 3 and 4 for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Kind is PDF \u2192 move to Documents</li>\n<li>Kind is Archive \u2192 move to Downloads/Archives</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>6.</strong> Save the workflow with a name like \u201c<strong>Downloads Cleaner</strong>\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Optional: You can create another workflow that deletes DMG files older than 1 day and trigger it using the Calendar app with a Custom alert if you want it to run on a schedule.</em></p>\n<p>This one Automator action keeps my Downloads folder clean without me doing anything. I used to spend time dragging files around or deleting installers every Friday. Now it's automatic.</p>\n<p>This honestly replaces paid apps like CleanMyMac or Hazel for this type of cleanup.</p>\n<p><strong>If people are interested I\u2019ll keep sharing more Mac automations that don\u2019t require any paid tools or coding.</strong></p>",

For now, this is just the first showcase. Once it\u2019s ready, I\u2019ll release it as a free beta version for the community and keep it updated for a long time.</p>\n<p>I have a few questions out of curiosity. Is this legal? I\u2019m trying to make an open-source app that doesn\u2019t collect any user data and is safe to use. But I haven\u2019t researched much \u2014 could YouTube sue me for this?</p>\n<p>Other than that, if there\u2019s a feature you think would be nice to have, let me know. I\u2019ll try to add it as best as I can.</p>\n<p>Let me also mention that the app is currently being developed in Turkish. When I release the beta, it will support both Turkish and English.</p>\n<h1>Features I\u2019m planning to implement, if possible:</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>A\u00a0<strong>\u201cminimize video\u201d</strong>\u00a0button \u2014 when clicked, the video will shrink into the bottom section of the sidebar, allowing easier controls.</li>\n<li>A\u00a0<strong>compact mode for music</strong>, similar to how Apple Music works. I\u2019m not sure if I can manage it yet, but I\u2019ll try.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The app will be\u00a0<strong>completely free</strong>. I also want to say this:</p>\n<p>Before I started this journey, I used to question why some apps were paid. But now I understand \u2014 it\u2019s truly difficult. There are constant bugs and issues, especially for a broad app like this (at least from my perspective). I really hope I can reach a flawless version one day.</p>\n<p>Lastly, if you want, I can create a\u00a0<strong>GitHub page</strong>\u00a0and share what I add to the app daily or weekly. Once it\u2019s ready for public use, I\u2019ll share it through the same GitHub page.</p>",

It literally dims all other windows except the one you\u2019re working in.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>DropOver: Drag-and-drop file holder.

Sidebar is the modern and most customizable Dock replacement for macOS out there. In general, it makes the space that the Dock would occupy a lot more useful.</p>\n<p>Since my last post here, some\u00a0<strong>cool new features have been added</strong>, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sidebar now offers a customization mode that combines all context specific options in one completely overhauled user interface, allowing you to easily customize various settings</li>\n<li>Application previews have been redesigned and in addition to the classic miniature application preview windows now also offers a list view for more cozy overview</li>\n<li>Two new ways of displaying running applications have been added, called \"Highlight\". Using this running indicator, Sidebar will show a highlighted area around running applications, with optionally the window count next to the icon</li>\n<li>Sidebar now offers a built-in functionality to either move all application windows, or those of a specific application to a specific screen</li>\n<li>Multimedia support has been enhanced to deal with new restrictions introduced by Apple starting with macOS 14.5. Starting with this update you can control Spotify and Apple Music again, even when running macOS 14.5+</li>\n<li>And of course a lot of other small improvements, performance improvements and bug fixes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For a full list of features added and bugs fixed, have a look at the roadmap at the\u00a0<a href=\"https://sidebarapp.net/changelog/\">Full Changelog</a>\u00a0If you want to see more screenshots of the app and a comprehensive overview of all features, please visit\u00a0<a href=\"https://sidebarapp.net/\">https://sidebarapp.net</a></p>\n<p>As usual, I've reset all prior trial licenses, so you can try Sidebar again, even if you tested it before.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m happy to support you with any questions, problems, bug reports, feature requests etc. :)</p><div><br></div><img src=\"https://i.redd.it/yrds8qjczywe1.png\" />",

This update is honestly the one I\u2019m most proud of, so here\u2019s what\u2019s new and improved:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Keyboard Shortcuts + Cheat Sheet:</strong> You can now navigate and control wBlock with fast hotkeys. There\u2019s even an in-app cheat sheet\u2014your fingers never need to leave the keyboard.</li>\n<li><strong>Custom Filter Lists:</strong> Add, manage, and toggle any ad-blocking list you want\u2014besides the built-in ones. Imported lists? No problem. Sidebar toggle bugs and filter duplication are fixed too.</li>\n<li><strong>Epic Speed Boost (No More Lag!):</strong> The UI is dramatically faster. All the sluggishness, animation lag, and slow filter updates are gone\u2014background processing everywhere.</li>\n<li><strong>(Almost) Bulletproof YouTube Ad-Blocking:</strong> Ad scripts now inject <em>earlier</em> for much better blocking. Enjoy cleaner YouTube (including the homepage and while watching videos). Note that some users still have issues when visiting a YouTube video by pasting a link; YouTube is becoming really annoying when it comes to ads and I'll need some extra time to figure this out.</li>\n<li><strong>No More Annoying Permission Popups:</strong> You won\u2019t be bugged for data access every launch anymore! All that background permission nagging is fixed for good.</li>\n<li><strong>Built-in Language &amp; Custom Filters:</strong> Chinese, Spanish, Portuguese, and many international filters now work flawlessly. Got issues with AdGuard lists before? They\u2019re all fixed.</li>\n<li><strong>See What You\u2019re Blocking:</strong> Filter lists now show the real number of rules, and you can click to go right to the homepage/source.</li>\n<li><strong>Download Progress for Filter Updates:</strong> Never wonder \u201cis it hung?\u201d again\u2014there\u2019s now a live progress bar while updating filters.</li>\n<li><strong>Cleaner, Simpler Interface:</strong> The sidebar is gone, popups are more intuitive, and, finally, every log window and popup can be closed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are ton of smaller bug fixes and UX tweaks too, from \u201crefresh all filters\u201d to improved default settings and support for more macOS versions. The menu, tooltips, and every page should feel easier and friendlier!</p>\n<p><strong>\ud83d\ude4f Thank you to everyone on Reddit and GitHub who\u2019s reported bugs, shared ideas, and encouraged me along the way.</strong> Your support and feedback have shaped every part of this project and made wBlock what it is today! This truly is built <em>for</em> the community, <em>by</em> the community.</p>\n<p>If you haven\u2019t tried wBlock yet, or you gave up on ad-blockers that \u201calmost\u201d worked\u2014give it a go! And if you enjoy it, please star the repo, open suggestions, or just spread the word.</p>\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://github.com/0xCUB3/wBlock\">check out the GitHub</a> or <a href=\"https://testflight.apple.com/join/DFGenhRn\">download it now using TestFlight</a>.</p>\n<p><em>(P.S Massive thanks again to everyone who gave honest feedback, feature ideas, or just a kind word along the way.

Perfect for everything from quick cooking reminders to tracking long-term project deadlines visually, right on your screen.</p>\n<p><strong>Why did I build it?</strong> <br />\nI originally wanted a timer that was always visible on my screen, but didn't constantly block me from clicking on windows underneath it. That led to the \"pass-through\" feature, and from there, I kept finding new things I wanted to add, resulting in the app you see today.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m releasing it <strong>completely free</strong> on the App Store (no ads, no IAPs, no catches) to keep it accessible for anyone who might find it useful.</p>\n<p><strong>Here's what it can do (Key features):</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Super Easy Creation:</strong> Click the menu bar icon and drag \u2013 the farther you drag, the longer the timer.</li>\n<li><strong>Click-Through Timers (Pass-Through Mode):</strong> Timers fade slightly on hover, letting you click <em>right through</em> them to interact with content underneath.</li>\n<li><strong>On-Overlay Controls:</strong> Quickly resize, move, add/subtract time, pause, open the manager, or close the timer directly on the overlay itself.</li>\n<li><strong>Deep Appearance Customization:</strong> Fonts, backgrounds, colors, gradients, opacity, progress ring styles \u2013 make it look <em>exactly</em> how you want. Save your favorite color themes, too.</li>\n<li><strong>Default Timer Settings:</strong> Define your preferred style and behavior once, and all new timers will use those settings automatically.</li>\n<li><strong>Flexible Time Display:</strong> Show units from seconds up to years. Timers can auto-switch units (e.g., minutes to seconds when under 60s), and you can optionally display remaining time as a percentage.</li>\n<li><strong>Recurring Timers:</strong> Set timers to repeat daily, weekly, or at custom intervals.</li>\n<li><strong>Custom End Notifications:</strong> Create unique notifications for when specific timers complete.</li>\n<li><strong>Visible Across Spaces:</strong> Timers stay visible even when you switch between Spaces.</li>\n<li><strong>Countdown Manager:</strong> A central window to view, edit, and manage all your timers.</li>\n<li><strong>Window Behavior:</strong> Control whether timers float above everything, act like standard windows, or ignore screen boundaries.</li>\n<li><strong>And More:</strong> Includes keyboard shortcuts, options to hide timers until they start, reverse progress bar direction, and other useful features.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What's Next &amp; Feedback:</strong> <br />\nThis is just v1.0! I have a list of features and optimizations I'd love to add, especially if there's interest from the community.</p>\n<p>Please check it out! I'd love to hear what you think. Let me know about any bugs you find or features you'd like to see added.</p>\n<p><strong>Download link:</strong> <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/countdown-timer-pro/id6744842468\">https://apps.apple.com/us/app/countdown-timer-pro/id6744842468</a></p>\n<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Made a free Mac app to create highly customizable, click-through countdown timer overlays.

Excited to share some of these new features with the community.</p>\n<p><strong>Dropdown mode (Traditional menu mode)</strong> - Antinote can now live permanently in your menu bar, dropping down when needed. It will show over full-screen apps and also on all desktops. You can change how big you want Antinote to be in settings.</p>\n<p><strong>Cmd-V OCR</strong> - Any image you drag (and now paste) into Antinote will get automatically OCR'd into plain text. Perfect for catching things during screen-shares or hard-to-copy data tables.</p>\n<p><strong>AutoPaste</strong> - Type \"paste\" and Antinote will listen to your clipboard. Anything you put in the clipboard will be automatically pasted in the note. Change the delimiter to anything you like. Great to skip the tedious cmd-tab / cmd+v part of these quick workflows.</p>\n<p><strong>Raycast / Alfred Extensions -</strong> Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/sc0\">PanKacper</a>, we are now <a href=\"https://www.raycast.com/sc0/antinote\">officially in the Raycast Store</a>, and also have an <a href=\"https://github.com/sc0/antinote-alfred-workflow/tree/main\">Alfred Extension</a>. These will let you create notes (blank or with content), pin/unpin, and search your notes directly from your favourite super-app.</p>\n<p><strong>Translucency -</strong> (macOS 15+) - Make the background translucent with Apple's materials and change the opacity of the effect to blend it with your favourite theme.</p>\n<p><strong>8 new themes</strong> -  Piccolo, A24, Tartan, Agrabah, Maud'Dib, Knight, Sanrio, Shadow Moses. Not sure how many of you will get the references, but each is inspired by something from my childhood.</p>\n<p>Every single one of these were suggestions from the community. Please <a href=\"https://discord.gg/2SKQbJM9Mz\">join us on Discord.</a> </p>\n<p>Also - I wanted to shout out this YouTube channel (AppsNTips) for making the first Antinote video out in the wild: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKGOPgOiuI\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKGOPgOiuI</a></p>\n<p><strong>Try it out here:</strong></p>\n<h1><a href=\"https://antinote.io\">Antinote.io</a></h1>\n<p>7 day free trial</p>\n<p><strong>$5 one-time.</strong> Forever updates.</p>",

As a software engineer, I don't like that. Transparency matters.</p>\n<p>So, I decided to make my commercial <a href=\"https://clipbook.app\">clipboard manager</a> open source. Anyone can inspect the source code, verify that data stays local and never leaves the user's device. Anyone can <a href=\"https://github.com/vladimir-ikryanov/ClipBook/blob/main/README.md#building-clipbook\">build the app from source</a> and use it.</p>\n<p><strong>GitHub</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/vladimir-ikryanov/ClipBook\">https://github.com/vladimir-ikryanov/ClipBook</a></p>\n<p>At the same time, the app is still commercial, as I need to cover hosting, tooling, and development costs. I know this means anyone can build the app from source and use it for free. Or even rebrand and sell it, but I think the trade-off is worth it.</p>\n<p>What do you think about this approach?

As a Uni student, here are the apps that I use every day and my honest user experience and feedback. Most of the apps installed are free, but any that aren't will have their price factored into my overall review. </p>\n<p><strong>All of these apps are super easy to install and use and don't require any complex coding knowledge!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. Media Mate</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wouter01.github.io/MediaMate/\">Media Mate Website</a></p>\n<p>I came across this app 2+ years ago, right when it launched. I hated the Vanilla macOS volume and brightness HUD, and Media Mate was an amazing alternative. In the last two years, the developer(s) have continued to refine and perfect this app with new features and customization options. It is one of the easiest apps to install and set up thanks to its super intuitive UI. While other Notch Apps have come since then that offer more features, none of them do what Media Mate does, as well as Media Mate does it. This app is perfect for anyone looking to refresh some aspects of the outdated macOS HUD. As one of the few paid apps on this list, the modest price tag of 7 euros (roughly $7 USD or $10 CAD) gives you lifetime access to 5 licences. I was more than satisfied with the price when I bought it 2 years ago and since then, the dev(s) have blown me away time and time again. Their ability to constantly release bug-free updates (I have never encountered a bug in my time using it) and well-refined make Media Mate integrate beautifully into macOS. To further emphasize how seamless this app is, I have found myself looking at a friend's computer when they change their volume and almost forgetting the Media Mate isn't a part of the Vanilla macOS. THAT'S HOW SEAMLESSLY THIS APP INTEGRATES INTO YOUR MAC!</p>\n<p>After over 2 years of use, I can confidently say that Media Mate gets a 10/10 from me. It does its job beautifully, and updates never feel like they were rushed out unfinished. Apps have come since which try to be better by having more bells and whistles but for those who just want an app which perfectly adds to your Mac, Media Mate stands alone as the best.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Ice</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/jordanbaird/Ice/blob/main/README.md\">Ice Github Page</a></p>\n<p>Inspired by Bartender, Ice allows you to customize your menu bar and give it a clean and minimalist look. I love that this app solved my constant gripe about having a cluttered menu bar. I got this app initially before getting a Bartender key from someone else, so I'm able to give a direct comparison between the two. You are able to decide between \u201cAlways shown,\u201d \u201cHidden,\u201d and \u201cAlways Hidden.\u201d</p>\n<p>Always shown is pretty self-explanatory. Items in the always-shown section will always be visible. I only have the date and time there, but that's just my love of minimalism speaking.</p>\n<p>Hidden is for your icons that you use semi-regularly but don't want to see all the time. These icons are revealed by dragging the mouse to the top of the screen. With the icons hiding again after moving the mouse away. This is where I keep my Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and other icons that I visit on a fairly regular basis but not too often.</p>\n<p>Always hidden works the same as the hidden section, except it doesn't reveal when you drag your mouse to the top of the screen. Instead, simply hold option and click the top of the screen to reveal the always hidden bar, which goes back to being hidden once you move the mouse away from the top of the screen. I really only use this for certain apps which force an icon into the menu bar with no ability to disable it.</p>\n<p>There are two reasons why, in my opinion, Ice is actually a better app than Bartender, which I will explain below.</p>\n<p>Number one: IT'S FREE. The beauty of the app being free is that if you don't like it, you can uninstall and never think about it again. For offering all the same features without the cost, there isn't any drawback to at least trying out Ice before spending a whopping $30 CAD (approx 20 USD and Euro) on Bartender. After showing Ice to the person who gave me their bartender key, he was pretty pissed that he'd spent all that money, and I was able to get the same thing for free.</p>\n<p>Number two: This may not be much to everyone, but I love it. When Bartender hides apps from your menu bar, it replaces them with a plain grey space, which is pretty lame compared to what Ice has to offer. With Ice, any area which isn't being used in your menu bar is instead seamlessly replaced by your wallpaper! This feature works regardless of if you're using a still image or a dynamic wallpaper. Ice will always fill the space back in, which makes the menu bar much smaller and your screen much bigger! It reminds me of when Apple switched from the notch to the dynamic island with the iPhone 14. Even though there wasn't much more screen space being added, the screen feels much bigger and the camera housing feels less pronounced than with the notch. Overall, while this feature doesn't serve much of a use, it makes the top of your screen feel much cleaner without the grey bar running along the top of it.</p>\n<p>Overall, Ice gets an 8/10 from me. It has a few bugs now and then, but its dev team is super responsive to feedback and works really hard to fix bugs in a timely manner. Even with that in mind, there is no world where spending $30 on Bartender is better than at least trying Ice at no cost. For me, This is a rare example of an app where the free version is better than the paid.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Icon Champ</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macenhance.com/iconchamp.html\">IconChamp Install</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=487G8qaBky0&amp;ab_channel=MacProTips\">IconChamp YouTube Tutorial</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://macosicons.com/#/\">Mac Icons</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/image2icon-make-your-icons/id992115977?mt=12\">Image2Icon File Converter</a></p>\n<p>One of my most recent additions, IconChamp is another app that helps you modernize your Mac by giving you the ability to change your app icons to whatever you want. I love the dark icons that came out in iOS18 and wanted a way to give all the apps in my dock a common theme.</p>\n<p>This app has both a free and paid version. The free version allows you to change any apps that you have installed manually, as well as your folder icons on your user folders. The paid version is the only app I've ever been able to find which gives you the ability to change the icons of the base macOS apps and folders. The paid version gives you 3 keys and comes in at a price of approx $15 CAD (approx 10 USD and Euro). It's not the cheapest app, and most people will probably be more than fine with the free version, but the paid version gives that extra bit of personalization we all love (it's the reason that I, along with so many others, are in this subreddit in the first place).</p>\n<p>The beauty of IconChamp is that it's a simple drag-and-drop process, it doesn't require you to disable any security features, and any changes can be reverted with (literally) one click of a button. Since the release of macOS Sequoia, the app has gained a few bugs which, as far as I can see, haven't had any attempts of being remedied. I had to play around with it a bit and came across a YouTube video which helped me install the right version and gave the full run tutorial. I was able to get the majority of my images from the website featured in the video. For the apps which I couldn't find a version I liked on the website, I simply googled what I was looking for and used another app which will also be linked to convert the .png into a .icns file (the standard file type used for Apple app icons)(Since that, I noticed on their website that they claim to accept \u201call standard image file types,\u201d so I think I took the scenic route for those extra icons by installing a whole other app to convert the file). One bug I encountered after uploading my desired icons was that while the app icons changed in the launchpad, the apps in my dock stayed the same. This was easily fixed by removing and re-adding those apps to my dock. The one app I haven't been able to change is the Calendar app. From doing some research online, it seems that the Calendar app has something special about it which makes it impossible to change its icon. Regardless, I love the ability to customize the rest of my apps and give my computer a more cohesive theme.</p>\n<p>Overall, I rate IconChamps a 7/10. While it has some bugs and the process can be a bit tedious, I found the finished product to be worth the process. The shared theme in my dock really makes it look a thousand times better, and I love that IconChamp is able to change system apps on top of third-party ones. The price tag for the pro version will certainly turn some people off, but the free version is still an amazing app for anyone wanting to update some older app icons.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Notch Focus Timer</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/notch-focus-timer/id6477333821?mt=12&amp;src=AppAgg.com\">Notch Focus Timer</a></p>\n<p>One of the most simple additions to any Mac with a notch, Notch Timer is a super clean timer app that uses the Notch to display how long is left. The app is controlled through the menu bar, where, unlike Apple, you can set a timer as long as you'd like (seriously, I was able to make a time for 1,000,000,000 hours). You can also pause or stop the timer by simply dragging the mouse into the notch, which causes the timer to expand and display how long is left, and the buttons to pause or cancel. Notch Timer also allows you to toggle for different sounds to play once the timer has finished, and even change the colour of the bar wrapping around the notch to be any colour you desire. At a price of free and already on the App Store, there's no reason not to have this simple app on your Mac.</p>\n<p>Notch Focus Timer gets a 9/10. I can't think of any shortcomings in this app or any reason not to install it. The only concern I have is that I don't believe there is any way to delete a custom timer and I fear I now have a timer for 1,000,000,000 hours and no way to delete it. For what it is, it's pretty close to perfect. It's simple, it works perfectly, and it's super easy to use. Not every app needs to have 100 features, and this is a perfect example of that. Notch Timer does one thing, and it does it perfectly, so I can't ask anything more from it.</p>\n<p><strong>5. boringNotch</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://theboring.name/\">boringNotch Install</a></p>\n<p>I previously asked this subreddit which notch app was considered the best. As I anticipated, everyone had their own answer. The thing with these notch apps like Alcove, Dynamic Lake, and NotchNook, is that they all have different pros and cons, making this review a little more subjective. After doing the trial on those previously mentioned apps, I decided to try boringNotch before deciding which app to commit to. Since installing boringNotch, I have forgotten about the other 3. boringNotch is quite similar to NotchNook, but a little simpler with not as many bugs.</p>\n<p>As a bit of a newer app, boringNotch doesn't have all of the features that its competition does, but that isn't always a bad thing. The devs have a clear roadmap on their GitHub page which clearly outlines the features they have planned, and an active discord community in which they tease new features, answer community questions, and investigate bug reports. Currently, boringNotch has an integrated calendar, media player, and drop tray for files, among other things. While boringNotch doesn't currently offer a system hud replacement, it's been teased numerous times and looks to hopefully be ready for release in due course. I've come up with a temporary solution to this by using MediaMate for my system hud and boringNotch for its media player and other features. The team working on this app is passionate about their work and has a strong base and a roadmap which looks promising for the future. I haven't encountered any major bugs using boringNotch and the devs are good about looking into issues and fixing major problems in a timely manner.</p>\n<p>Considering the price, its competition, and the plans for the future, I've gone with an 8/10 for boringNotch. Sure other notch apps may have more features, but is the number of features the only thing used to decide which is better? Of course not. boringNotch is surprisingly stable for being a newer app and it's started with a really strong base. I look forward to seeing the devs continue to build off of their strong start as they work through their roadmap</p>\n<p><strong>5. Dato</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dato/id1470584107?mt=12\">Dato on the Apple App Store</a></p>\n<p>Having used Dato for a couple of years now, it's another one of those apps that I often forget isn't a part of macOS for everyone! Dato makes it easy to access your calendar and see your upcoming events by simply clicking the icon in the menu bar. It makes it super easy to check your schedule coming up without having to open the calendar app every time. It's another one of those apps that feels super seamless and having used it for over 2 years now, I can't imagine using my Mac without it. I probably use it 2-3 times A DAY because it just makes accessing your calendar so easy. It is the most expensive app on here, costing $16 USD ($23 CAD or approx 15 euros) from the App Store, but I can assure you that you will find Dato to be an absolute essential that is definitely worth the price.</p>\n<p>I'm giving Dato an 8/10. I've never encountered a bug using Dato and I'm confident to say that it will change how you use your calendar on your Mac. My only issue with Dato is the price. I fear that without a free trial, many will underestimate how amazing Dato is, and be turned away by its steep price. Furthermore, by being in the App Store instead of giving a few licence keys which could be split between a few people. Unless you are a part of Family Sharing like I was, $16 USD for one person is a high price to pay and definitely reduces the number of new users. However, those who push past the price will understand why I only docked 2 points from its rating. I promise you, the sting of the price will go away, and you will be left with a truly revolutionary app that totally changes how you use your calendar.</p>\n<p><strong>6. DockDoor</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/ejbills/DockDoor\">DockDoor Github</a></p>\n<p>Another recent installation, DockDoor makes it so much easier to manage all your windows. I usually like to keep my browser windows organized based on what I'm doing. This means I usually have 3 or 4 windows at a time for the different things I'm doing on my laptop. DockDoor will show you a preview of each window as you hover over it, making it super easy to manage and change windows. It's got a ton of customization and is another one of those apps that makes using a Mac that little bit better. I like being able to get a quick preview of what I have running on each app and I would totally recommend it for people who tend to have numerous apps and windows open at the same time. I've only had DockDoor for a little while now so I can't give the most in-depth review of it but my experience so far made it impossible to leave off of this list.</p>\n<p>Given DockDoor is free, it's another one of those apps where there's no reason not to install it and try it out. As a relatively newer app, I've encountered a few bugs which I'm sure will be fixed, but nothing that impacts your overall user experience. For these reasons, I've given DockDoor an 8/10 because I'm sure its bugs will be fixed and when that happens, you're left with a free app that makes managing your windows so much easier.</p>",

I recently shared a\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/appletv/comments/1h2qonl/was_gonna_discount_my_apple_tv_apps_for_black/\">similar\u00a0offer\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0Apple\u00a0TV\u00a0sub</a>\u00a0for several of my Apple TV apps during Black Friday and was thrilled by the overwhelming response and gratitude. It inspired me to extend the same generosity to this sub with my macOS app for Cyber Monday! As a way to express my appreciation, I\u2019m making my Mac meeting app,\u00a0<strong>MeetingMenu</strong>, completely\u00a0<strong>FREE</strong>\u00a0until midnight on December 3, UTC! No subscriptions, no catch\u2014just download and enjoy.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m the developer of MeetingMenu, a Mac app I created to solve my own meeting management headaches. Like many of you, I find myself doing lots of meetings online across various apps. I\u2019m frequently accessing the same settings and tools during meetings, and I wanted a way to keep them all in one convenient place\u2014right in the menu bar.</p>\n<p>Most important for me was being able to see my next meeting at a glance, with a countdown timer and the ability to launch it with a single click\u2014right in the menu bar. That feature alone has been a game-changer for staying organized and never missing a meeting.</p>\n<p>In addition, I wanted tools to simplify screen sharing, like quickly hiding my desktop, icons, and wallpaper to avoid any awkward moments. I also built in a privacy browser to prevent my bookmarks or history from showing during meetings.</p>\n<p>As I kept using it, I realized there were even more tools I frequently needed that were buried within the user interfaces of various meeting apps. So, I bundled them all into one app:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tools to quickly check my mic volume and see how I look on camera before meetings.</li>\n<li>A quick meeting launcher for platforms like Zoom, Teams, and Google Meet.</li>\n<li>Custom time zone views to see meeting times in different regions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other features include: sticky notes, in-meeting indicator, low power mode, WiFi signal check, audio quality test, and more\u2014all accessible from the menu bar.</p>\n<p>Yes, I know there are apps with overlapping features, but I needed something that combined everything I rely on in one place\u2014like a Swiss Army knife for meeting tools.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s how MeetingMenu came to life, and it\u2019s been a lifesaver for me. It\u2019s still relatively new, so I\u2019d really appreciate any feedback, feature suggestions, or tips to make it better for the community.</p>\n<p>\u23f3\u00a0<strong>This is a one-day offer, valid until midnight on December 3, UTC.</strong>\u00a0Must download today before it goes back to being paid.</p>\n<p>\ud83d\udc49\u00a0<a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/meetingmenu/id6538714770\">Download\u00a0MeetingMenu\u00a0for\u00a0Mac</a><br />\n\ud83d\udc49\u00a0<a href=\"https://meetingmenu.app/\">Visit\u00a0the\u00a0MeetingMenu\u00a0website</a></p>\n<p>Thanks again to this amazing community for your support\u2014you\u2019re the best!

Or, maybe you are experimenting with <a href=\"https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/open-core-legacy-patcher\">Open Core Legacy Patcher</a> to install a later version of macOS on a device that doesn't officially support it. In that case, you are going to need a copy of an OS, preferably bootable, and some sort of media to copy that OS installation onto. You can do the installation through other methods, like target disk mode or various imaging applications too, but they take some know how. The other thing you can use these files for is when experimenting with virtual machines in something like Virtual Box, UTM or VMWare Fusion.</p>\n<p><strong>Mist</strong></p>\n<p>To get a copy of the firmware and OS you need, I know of no easier method than using <a href=\"https://github.com/ninxsoft/Mist?tab=readme-ov-file\">Mist</a>, a free app available on GitHub. With Mist, you can get everything from the latest beta, all the way back to Mac OS X 7.5. You can get Intel or Apple Silicon installers, or the universal installers available for macOS Big Sur and later.</p>\n<p><strong>Balena Etcher</strong></p>\n<p>If you are planning to use an SD card or a USB drive, things work better when you flash the media than when you try to fiddle with partitions and permissions on your own from the command line. Luckily, there is an app for that. It is <a href=\"https://etcher.balena.io/\">Balena Etcher</a>, a free app with built-in safeguards to keep you from erasing the wrong drive. Balena Etcher will also create bootable media for Windows and various Linux builds too.</p>",

I\u2019ve just published my second macOS app, which detects when the last window of an app is closed and quits that app. This helps prevent unnecessary memory usage by apps that are not actively being used. While macOS does have built-in memory management, I\u2019ve encountered situations where the system runs out of memory without closing inactive apps. I created this app to ensure all apps without open windows are closed. The app is free\u2014hope you enjoy it, and feel free to share any feedback.
