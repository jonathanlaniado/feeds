I\u2019m excited to share with you an iOS app that I\u2019ve developed called CNDWN. It\u2019s fully developed in SwiftUI. It\u2019s also the first countdown app that offers all features for free and is available on Apple TV, iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and Mac!</p>\n<p>CNDWN is designed to help you keep track of important events and deadlines in your life. With this app, you can create and manage countdowns, countups, and progress bars with ease. The best part? It supports iCloud synchronization, so you can access your countdowns across all your Devices.</p>\n<p>One of the standout features of CNDWN is its support for Widgets and Live Activities. You can add widgets to your lock screen, home screen or standby screen (new in iOS 17), giving you quick access to your countdowns without having to open the app. The app also offers live activities, allowing you to track the progress of ongoing events in real-time.</p>\n<p>Never miss an important event again! CNDWN sends notifications for upcoming countdowns, and you can customize them to suit your needs.</p>\n<p>Last but not least, CNDWN supports dark mode, making it easy to use the app in low-light conditions without straining your eyes.</p>\n<p>I am also looking forward to implement the new Suggestions API for the new Apple Journal when it is released in iOS 17.1 or 17.2.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/id6455257754\">Download</a> CNDWN now and start counting down to your next big event!</p>\n<p>Looking forward to hearing your thoughts and feedback. Enjoy counting down with CNDWN.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/id6455257754\">https://apps.apple.com/app/id6455257754</a></p></div>",

I often fly on long flights and sometimes have to go to areas with limited access to power outlets, and it's become a bit of a struggle. My MacBook is getting on the older side, and I've noticed that the battery capacity isn't what it used to be. So, that's partly to blame for my battery headaches. </p>\n<p>I use my MacBook for work, and that often means running multiple browser tabs simultaneously. This drains the battery, and most tabs I can't afford to close. I've read online that some applications continue to run in the background, so I've become vigilant about shutting them down when I'm not using them. I've also learned to turn off Bluetooth when I'm not using it, and keeping my brightness low, which has helped a bit. </p>\n<p>But again, it often dies down on me and I\u2019m left helpless. It isn\u2019t too old to replace yet, so anything else I can do to maximize battery?  </p>\n<p>Your advice would be greatly appreciated!</p></div>",

Especially because you can have multiple such brains - one for each topic. My lawyer friend creates one brain for each of his cases, and uploads every document related to the case into it.</p>\n<p>If you want to try it out, you can test it for free for 30 days from this link - <a href=\"https://elephas.app/?ref=rMacApps-SuperBrain-2709\">Elephas</a></p>\n<p>This feature uses a combination of Mac storage with OpenAI\u2019s feature. Highly optimised for cost savings.</p>\n<p>And it's privacy friendly, and all the data remains on your computer (It does use OpenAI to generate embeddings. But the resulting data is stored on your local computer).</p>\n<p>I think there's huge potential in using AI as an assistant instead of a complete replacement for humans.</p>\n<p>That's my goal with this feature and this tiny Mac app. I hope you find it useful.</p>\n<p>I am looking forward to your feedback.</p>\n<p>I'd be happy to add new features and utilities based on your requests and suggestions.</p>\n<p>Thanks</p></div>",

About a year ago, I started went full time on my freelance writing business and ended up hiring more team members to the point where I wanted to switch from Evernote to something that had more functionality. I was originally using the personal Evernote plan before switching briefly to Evernote Teams (which is now over $25/user/month).</p>\n<p>Long story short, I ended up testing most/all of the major Evernote alternatives, and wanted to compile each of their pros and cons here in the hopes that it will save someone else some time and money. Below, you can find the pros and cons for all of the Evernote alternatives and similar apps I tried: Taskade, Notion, Obsidian, OneNote, Clickup and Google Keep.</p>\n<p>These are all quality apps, and what is \u201cbest\u201d depends partly on your needs and budget. Let me know if you're using any Evernote alternative(s) that I missed and I'll add them to the list!</p>\n<h2>Taskade: Evernote alternative with better collaboration + task/project management features</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.taskade.com/\">https://www.taskade.com/</a></p>\n<p>The first Evernote alternative I tried was actually Notion, but Notion's own price increases led me to discover the app that ultimately became my favorite: Taskade. Taskade is often billed as a Notion alternative, and has pretty much all of the features Notion does. I use the Pro plan, which is $19 per month for up to 10 team members. If you\u2019re not working with a team, I\u2019d highly recommend their free plan, but the biggest draw for me was Taskade\u2019s collaborative tools.</p>\n<p>Pros:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Taskade has much stronger collaboration features than Evernote. Beyond collaborative editing, Taskade has in-app chatting, video calls etc. which are all ideal for working with a team.</li>\n<li>Taskade has a really good web clipper! This is a big deal, as that is basically Evernote\u2019s best feature. Not all productivity and organization apps have a solid web clipper, so this is a key feature for an app to qualify as a great Evernote alternative, not just a supplement to Evernote.</li>\n<li>I also found it much better for task tracking and management than Evernote, especially with the large numbers of free templates they provide.</li>\n<li>There are AI features integrated into Taskade that make real-time suggestions as you work. It sounds gimmicky but they have a ton of templates that make it genuinely useful to use for stuff like generating ideas, cleaning up your writing, etc. all in the same interface.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If databases are your thing, then Notion is still a better option than Taskade.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Taskade managed to fill the gaps in functionality of Evernote with greater ease-of-use and flexibility than Notion, and the cost savings are huge. That is what makes it my all-around top pick.</p>\n<h2>Notion: Evernote alternative and a lot more</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.notion.so/\">https://www.notion.so/</a></p>\n<p>Speaking of Taskade, it's hard not to mention Notion, which is probably the best-known app in this sphere. I tested out the \u201cPlus\u201d plan, which costs $8 per user per month. Note how much less expensive that is than Evernote Teams.</p>\n<p>Not only does Notion cost less than most Evernote plans, but it was also more tailored to my needs. The original Evernote was built around individual note-taking and organizing. While Teams was developed for collaboration, that is what Notion was built to facilitate in the first place. Its collaboration features are richer and more powerful than what Evernote offers.</p>\n<p>Pros:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Not to continually dump on Notion, but Notion is still more affordable than Evernote even at its higher end plans, and comes with a lot more functionality for the money.</li>\n<li>Notion\u2019s template collection is awesome, and the code block integration is nice.</li>\n<li>Given the concern around questionable support from Evernote going forward, Notion is a nice alternative in having a massive community and company behind it that regularly rolls out new features and fixes. They're still lacking some things like a nice offline mode, but it's generally improving.</li>\n<li>There are a lot of customization options available.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Notion loads slowly on some of my devices, and occasionally feels unwieldy and unnecessarily complicated. If you're looking for an Evernote alternative that focuses mostly on notetaking/web clipping etc., it can be overly complicated/pricey.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Obsidian: excellent offline-only Evernote alternative for simple notetaking</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://obsidian.md/\">https://obsidian.md/</a></p>\n<p>Pros:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Obsidian is similar to Notion and Taskade in that it uses Markdown and has a lot of added functionality that Evernote doesn\u2019t.</li>\n<li>The core of Obsidian is completely free. It\u2019s still worth checking if you need any of their add-on features, as they do charge for these.</li>\n<li>Works well offline and uses the same markdown format that\u2019s easy to learn even if you\u2019re not already familiar</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lack of good collaboration features made it impossible for my use case.</li>\n<li>Rough mobile experience: this was one of my issues with Evernote, and Obsidian unfortunately has the same issue, where it\u2019s simply not that built-out on mobile.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Overall, Obsidian\u2019s attraction and major issues both come from being a fairly simple app. Similarly, the lack of online features can be a con (if you work with others or like sharing/collaborating on documents) but also a pro (if you\u2019re looking for something that won\u2019t distract you and/or to work offline).</p>\n<h2>OneNote: intuitive notetaking app that integrates into MS Office</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/onenote/digital-note-taking-app\">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/onenote/digital-note-taking-app</a></p>\n<p>OneNote was actually the first alternative to Evernote that I tried; I have a 365 subscription, so I figured I may as well. As you would guess from the name of this app, it is a direct competitor to Evernote.</p>\n<p>There is shared note-taking available through OneNote, but that is about the extent of it. Its functionality is pretty limited when it comes to managing and collaborating with teams on tasks.</p>\n<p>Pros:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Overall, I found it easier to stay organized using OneNote than Evernote.</li>\n<li>Like Evernote, OneNote is great for what it does. It offers fantastic content sorting, tagging and annotation.</li>\n<li>While I\u2019m not a huge Microsoft user, I suspect it\u2019s nice to have everything on one subscription if you are.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>OneNote is not so great at web clipping. Evernote is way better in this area.</li>\n<li>For collaborative teams, OneNote is too basic to really get much done.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>OneNote is one of the closest to Evernote in terms of what it\u2019s best at, but I didn\u2019t find it much better overall at anything that would make me stick with it.</p>\n<h2>Clickup: well-rounded task focused alternative</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://clickup.com/\">https://clickup.com/</a></p>\n<p>While Clickup is an alternative to Evernote, like Notion and Taskade, it is more of an all-in-one productivity and organization suite.</p>\n<p>Pros:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Clickup is a solid task management app that offers whiteboards, docs, dashboards, chat and more to facilitate easy collaboration.</li>\n<li>I didn\u2019t use Clickup long enough to verify this myself, but I\u2019ve heard time and again that the support team is great, and the development team works hard to maintain and update the app.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>While Clickup does a lot of things Evernote does not, Evernote still is better for organizing materials for easy reference.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>(Google) Keep: simple, free notetaking alternative integrated into Google's apps</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.google.com/keep/\">https://www.google.com/keep/</a></p>\n<p>One more app I tried out was Google Keep. I\u2019ve used it on and off since 2015 because it integrated nicely into Google Calendar, and always found it to fall a bit short in terms of functionality. But it is free if you have a Google account, and I was curious how it compared to Evernote.</p>\n<p>Pros:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Google Keep supports web clipping, though with fewer bells and whistles than Evernote.</li>\n<li>You can share with other users with Google Keep; it also includes other basic features for checklists, reminders and so on.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The simplicity of Google Keep may appeal to users who only need the basics, but the functionality is quite limited compared to Evernote.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That wraps it up! Some of the Evernote alternatives I tested out were more direct notetaking only competitors, like Google Keep and OneNote. Unfortunately most of the note-taking only apps lack various features that Evernote has without adding enough other features to make up for it. Others, like Taskade, Notion and ClickUp, were designed to accommodate note-taking within a broader task-management and collaboration suite.</p>\n<h1>Tl;dr:</h1>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Taskade:</strong> Notetaking + task management focused app with a nice free plan. Overall my favorite as it's the most intuitive for task/project management and has the best collaboration features for working with a team at a lower price than both Evernote and Notion.</li>\n<li><strong>Notion:</strong> Notion is arguably the biggest Evernote alternative. Solid notetaking functionality and other features Evernote lacks. Still cheaper than Evernote even after raising their prices!</li>\n<li><strong>Obsidian:</strong> Nice alternative built around markdown that's my favorite for offline only use, as it lacks the distractions of the web based ones. Unfortunately that also means it lacks some of the functionality I need for everyday use.</li>\n<li><strong>OneNote:</strong> Microsoft's notetaking app that comes free with Office 365 and other plans. I didn't spend too long on OneNote as I don't use many MS apps and couldn't justify paying for it after we left Office 365, but it seems to be well integrated into their other apps.</li>\n<li><strong>Google Keep:</strong> Free, simple notetaking app. Lacks some of Evernote's features but can be a good free Evernote alternative if you don't need advanced functionality and already use Google's other apps.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Each of these alternatives has somewhat different target markets and I'd recommend trying out a few as they all have free plans. I mainly use Taskade day-to-day as it has all the features I used Evernote for like web-clipping and easy notetaking, but adds better teamwork and task management functionality that I needed for my business. With that said, I also use Obsidian as an offline-only one for when I don't want to get distracted.</p>\n<p>Let me know in the comments if I missed any that you guys have tried and try to include pros/cons if you can.</p></div>",

I\u2019d <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/14n09ph/personal_gpt_a_tiny_ai_chatbot_that_runs_fully/\">posted</a> <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/14ijgtj/giveaway_personal_gpt_an_ai_chatbot_that_runs/\">about</a> this app on r/ChatGPT and r/Apple a few months ago, and got a great reception from both those subreddits.</p>\n<p>The app has come a long way since then. It started off as a universal iOS and macOS app with a fine tuned <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/togethercomputer/RedPajama-INCITE-Chat-3B-v1\">3B parameter LLM</a> on both macOS and iOS. Two months in, Apple asked me to rename the app (It was originally called Personal GPT) because OpenAI had a trademark on the term \u201cGPT\u201d in Switzerland. Eventually, I added a 7B parameter <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/Tap-M/Luna-AI-Llama2-Uncensored\">Llama 2 Uncensored</a> model as an optional download on iPhone 14 series phones and M1/M2 iPads. The current Mac app also ships with the 7B parameter Llama 2 Uncensored model by default.</p>\n<p>I wanted to wait until I had improved the macOS app to a point where it was super good, before posting it here on r/macapps. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/private_llm/status/1701140429033324805\">v1.3</a> of the macOS app was approved by Apple\u2019s Mac App Store review this morning, and latest version brings the amazing <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/WizardLM/WizardLM-13B-V1.2\">WizardLM 13B v1.2</a> model as an optional 6.9GB download for users with Apple Silicon Macs and at least 16GB of RAM. This is a <a href=\"https://chat.lmsys.org/?leaderboard\">SOTA</a> model that in some cases can outperform some internet hosted models. Don\u2019t take my word for it, try it out with these <a href=\"https://benchmarks.llmonitor.com\">prompts</a> or your own. We\u2019ve got a public <a href=\"https://testflight.apple.com/join/GmnO1fdb\">TestFlight beta</a> if you\u2019d like to try the app before buying it. It\u2019s a universal app, with means that if you purchase it on either the iOS App Store or the Mac App Store and you\u2019ll also get it on the other. Also, the app supports <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/family-sharing/\">Family Sharing</a>.</p>\n<p>I'm working on adding support for downloading even bigger (34B param) models for Apple Silicon Mac users with 32GB or more RAM, soon.</p>\n<p>Please feel free to AMA here, or on the app\u2019s <a href=\"https://discord.gg/g2vMMbtHRt\">discord</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/private-llm/id6448106860\">App Store</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://privatellm.app/\">Website</a></p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p></div>",

My goal with Godspeed was to make every single action doable with just your keyboard, and to have those actions respond instantly. Like Superhuman for your todo list.</p>\n<p>I built Godspeed for myself and have been using it daily for about six months now. Before that I used a couple other apps, like OmniFocus, but have found that they all have weak keyboard support and feel pretty slow.</p>\n<p>So Godspeed is my answer to those weak points.</p>\n<p>Something I want to note especially for the r/macapps crowd: Godspeed is an Electron app. But it may be the fastest and most memory-efficient Electron app you've ever used. It generally uses less memory than most of the native apps I run, and it's definitely a hell of a lot faster than them.</p>\n<p>A few of my friends have started using it in the past couple months and their feedback has been incredibly valuable. So I've decided to open up access to more folks for a public beta. Access is free during the beta, but if all goes well I do eventually intend to offer subscription and one-time purchase options. And I'll have discounts available for beta users!</p>\n<p>Thanks for checking it out, I'd appreciate any feedback you have!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://godspeedapp.com\">https://godspeedapp.com</a></p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/88n2lyyvrk7b1.gif\">a short gif showing Godspeed in action</a></p></div>",

To put the price change in to context, Apollo, one of the most popular 3rd party apps for Reddit, is looking at a cost of $1.7 million per month to continue operating. That's a cost of $12,000 per 50 million API requests. In contrast, Apollo pays Imgur $166 for every 50 million API calls.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>This means popular apps like\u00a0Apollo,\u00a0Reddit Is Fun,\u00a0Narwhal\u00a0and many more will have to shut down, permanently.</p>\n<p>Even if you're not using a 3rd party app yourself, these changes are likely to impact the communities you enjoy as well, with the vast majority of moderation teams relying on 3rd party or self-made tools, that utilize Reddit's API.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>What happens; On June 12th,\u00a0we and a growing number of other subs\u00a0- large and small - will go dark for 48 hours. During that time, you will not be able to view or post any content on\u00a0r/MacApps. This action isn't something we take lightly.</p>\n<p>We understand that many of you enjoy coming here on a daily basis to keep up with the apps, but we believe that we must take a stand on this topic - and this is how we can do so.</p>\n<p>We understand that Reddit is a company that has to make money in order to offer us a place to be the community that we are - but killing beloved 3rd party apps is not they way to do it. We are not asking Reddit to provide a paid service for free - we are asking for reasonable pricing for apps that people have come to love and depend on to participate in their communities.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>What you can do to support this:</p>\n<p>While subs going dark is one thing, regular users can help as well.</p>\n<p>Reach out to Reddit via the channels available to you: Modmail\u00a0r/reddit, comment in relevant posts regarding the API changes, submit your comments via the contact forms.</p>\n<p>Spread the word about the changes and the consequences where you can. Doesn't have to be on Reddit. The important thing is getting it attention.</p>\n<p>Participate in the communities that highlight this issue:\u00a0r/Save3rdPartyApps,\u00a0r/apolloapp,\u00a0r/redditisfun,\u00a0r/getnarwhal</p>\n<p>And finally stay off Reddit completely from June 12th to 14th. The blackout is one thing, but users staying away from the site entirely will send an equally important message.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Thank you,</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p></div>",

I've been an Alfred user for years. However, for the sake of fairness, curiosity, and always searching for something better and more efficient, I decided to install Raycast and compare since anyone who has been on r/macapps for a while may know that that's <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/macapps/comments/13c1c7m/master_list_of_definitive_app_comparisons_view/\">a hobby</a>. </p>\n<p>Here are some considerations to keep in mind: </p>\n<p><strong>Your Privacy in Their</strong> <strong>Privacy Policies.</strong><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.alfredapp.com/terms/\"><strong>Alfred</strong></a> - Privacy-conscious. <em>Alfred is the product.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Alfred only contacts our server when activating your Powerpack license  in order to validate it, as well as periodically checking for new  software updates.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.raycast.com/privacy\"><strong>Raycast</strong></a> - <em>You are the product.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We use Personal Data for the following purposes...<br />\nTo analyze how you interact with our Service...<br />\nTo maintain and improve the content and functionality of the Service...<br />\nTo develop new products and services...<br />\nTo tell you about products or services we believe may be of interest to you... <br />\nReason: For our legitimate interests or those of a third party, i.e. to promote our business to you...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Efficiency Considerations.</strong><br />\nAccording to my usage history, I trigger Alfred about 42 times daily, or 15,330 times yearly.</p>\n<p>In Raycast, every search is stalled behind a menu that needs to be triggered unless you configure an additional shortcut for each feature. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Want to search for a file? Gotta select the option first and hit enter to begin searching.</li>\n<li>Want to perform an action on the file? Yet another shortcut (CMD+K).</li>\n<li>Want to trigger any other feature? You guessed it, another shortcut or menu to trigger first.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That's an additional 2\u20135 seconds <em>every single search</em> or 8.5\u201321 <em>HOURS</em> a year for something Alfred can do immediately on the first trigger. Am I missing something here? </p>\n<p><strong>Appearance.</strong> <br />\nThe Raycast preferences and user interface is the clear winner in terms of eyecandy, no arguments to be had. Alfred could learn from this, though Alfred has more granular customizable preferences. </p>\n<p><strong>Complexity.</strong><br />\nBecause Raycast has a cleaner design, it can be easier to find what you're looking for if you're not a power user. </p>\n<p><strong>Feature offerings.</strong><br />\nThis is basically a tie for the most common features\u2014E.g., web/file searches, clipboard history, calculator, notes, links, etc.<br />\nThe recent AI integration with Raycast is the major distinction ($10/month or $96/yr <a href=\"https://www.raycast.com/pricing\">subscription</a>). <br />\nOne can also use the API from OpenAI with an Alfred workflow with Powerpack ($42 <a href=\"https://www.alfredapp.com/shop/\">license</a>). </p>\n<p>Ultimately, we all have to consider and decide what we care about most. <br />\nWhat unique features, considerations, or tips have I missed that stand out for why you prefer one over the other?</p></div>",

I use this for my collection of academic notes, which I prefer to keep local-first. Nota looks much nicer, and is much more suited to handling a large collection. Obsidian has far more features, but I don't need most of them anyway, and hopefully Nota will continue to evolve.</p>\n<p>Finally a shoutout to Scrivener, which I have been using for a while now and continue to enjoy.

Seriously, you've been amazing and super helpful.</p>\n<p><strong>TLDR: These are NOT performance tests. I only measure raw power usage!!!!!!</strong> Each browser was tested 3x and each test is a 20min long scenario of common usage pattern - Google, Notion, GitHub, YouTube, PiP, wolt, Shopping, reading news, looking for apartments. Each run is same as all others with an almost second precision thanks to the magic of endless patience and screen recording.</p>\n<p>I've spent too much of my life on this, and won't do it again. :P I've written HOW below, so just imagine make your own scenario that suits you, and do your own tests. :)</p>\n<p>If you think my tests are imprecise, or are triggered by not seeing your favourite browser, great, go yell at your browser vendor. They should be doing these tests, not a random bloke on Reddit.</p>\n<h1>Results:</h1>\n<p>Chrome is still the king resource hog on macOS. Edge is even worse but is at least aware of the issue and trying. Safari lives in a magical buggy world of its own. Brave is just Chrome. Orion is kinda startup-y. Arc is hard to work with. Opera trying to please everyone. Firefox is unprofitable but very solid.</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/ut58map3d2ua1.png?width=2688&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=df50bd0ef10db9686a9e9f2bbaf3f159dd8c8427</p>\n<h1>Per test breakdown:</h1>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/b8ugbzhid2ua1.png?width=2034&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=780429972d312ce674edde571400fe9fdfe5c0c9</p>\n<h1>What I used:</h1>\n<p>I ran all the tests on the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>macOS Ventura 13.3.1, on MacBook Pro 14\" M1 Pro with 32GB RAM</strong></li>\n<li>Edge 112.0.1722.39</li>\n<li>Arc 0.98.1</li>\n<li>Brave v1.50.114</li>\n<li>Safari Version 16.4</li>\n<li>Firefox 112.0</li>\n<li>Opera 97.0.4719.63</li>\n<li>Orion v0.99.123.3</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>How I did it:</h1>\n<p>This time I used powermetrics with a per-second measurement interval, which gave me Apple\u2019s approximation fo Combined Power or Package Power how it was called previously. Basically CPU + GPU + ANE but not including brightness, network etc.</p>\n<p>You can use this same bash pipeline to create your own measurements and save em into a file.</p>\n<pre><code>sudo powermetrics \\\n  -i 1000 \\\n  --samplers cpu_power,gpu_power \\\n  -a --hide-cpu-duty-cycle \\\n  --show-usage-summary \\\n  --show-extra-power-info \\\n| grep --line-buffered -E \"Combined Power \\(CPU \\+ GPU \\+ ANE\\): [0-9]*\" \\\n| sed -u -n 's/Combined Power (CPU + GPU + ANE): \\([0-9]*\\) mW/\\1/p' \\\n| while read -r line; do printf \"%s, %s\\n\" $(date +%s) $line; done \\\n&gt; ./recordings/raw/general/brave.csv\n</code></pre>\n<p>You'd probably have to chart em later using something, since its just raw data csv that includes a timestamp and mW measurement on each second, and <a href=\"https://github.com/markomitranic/strom-bench\">I used Elixir's Livebook</a> for the charts above, you can use anything you wish to.</p>\n<p><strong>Just imagine make your own scenario that suits you, and do your own tests. :)</strong></p>\n<p>This time I tried to make the test very balanced. In previous tests, which included a lot more tab switching, and no WebGL and media consumption, Safari was using 10x less than Chrome. While that was funny, I wanted a test that includes those things that Safari is not so good at.</p>\n<p>Additional notes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All tabs remain open. Each time i jump to the next \"test item\" i open a new tab in the same browser. I wanted to see how a browser with 20 open tabs behaves.</li>\n<li>Every time I am finished with a \"test item\" i go back to the Notion tab, to read what is the next test I need to run (also helped a lot with stabilising test results as it forces the browser to keep commonly used tabs in memory, and it gives me clear 10sec breakpoints where I \"cut\" the data)</li>\n<li>Only one browser is tested at a time. I restart the computer each time and charge the battery back to 100%.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Want to read more?</h1>\n<p>You don't have to. This is not an ad for my blogpost. I've copypasta-ed all the info into this post anyway. I've also already written about it in the previous 2 posts on this subreddit. If you still want it, released a <a href=\"https://medium.com/homullus/8-browsers-in-a-tiny-car-energy-efficiency-benchmark-fe3ca82f1690\">blogpost</a> which goes into it, if you are really interested, but thats not the point, all you want to know is in the charts above.</p></div>",

Based on the comments, I've made the test better, and added more popular browsers. People kept yelling how Chrome is now better - and it is clearly not.</p>\n<p>TLDR: It started very simple - I was in love with Arc UI, but noticed high energy usage and wanted to compare it to Safari. I am <strong>not concerned with performance, only energy usage</strong>, if you care about raw performance, this is not a post for you. These tests are not scientific, they reflect my usage on my machine, yours will be different! Here is the built-in app that I used to measure a 15minute average.</p>\n<p><code>sudo powermetrics -i 1000 --poweravg 1 | grep 'Average cumulatively decayed power score' -A 20</code></p>\n<h1>Results:</h1>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Safari</strong>: 140</li>\n<li><strong>Orion</strong>: 184</li>\n<li><strong>Firefox</strong>: 497</li>\n<li><strong>Arc</strong>: 622</li>\n<li><strong>Chrome</strong>: 1213</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Disclaimers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>IE - Disqualified because I don't care.</li>\n<li>SigmaOS - Disqualified because it feels like Vim and Notion had a baby. Sorry, not for me.</li>\n<li>Chrome's score was totally wild, it went up to 2k at one point, but later averaged 1.2k. No other browser had those spikes. I tested twice to ensure that was the case.</li>\n<li>Testing method seems very stabile. The numbers for Safari and Arc closely match my previous tests. So far I've ran tests 5x on those two browsers.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Testing:</h1>\n<p>Each test begins with a freshly powered on Mac with 100% battery and attached to power. All apps and OS are latest versions. Mac always kept at roughly the same temperature. The browsers don't have any extensions (unless they come with built-in ones) and are freshly installed. All window sizes kept the same, covering roughly 80% of the screen. Whenever I open a new tab, i leave the previous one open, thus every list item below has its own tab by the end.</p>\n<p>Script is as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Watch whole <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jrh5idPduJA\">2k HDR 60fps on YouTube</a> (paste url) in full screen mode.</li>\n<li>Watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drLZxyv79Oo\">Dave2d in HD</a> (paste url) in PiP, <strong>while doing all stuff below.</strong></li>\n<li>Search for \"<a href=\"https://drazevacshelter.org/en/\">drazevac shelter</a>\" on Google via address bar.

Go through the slideshow, read the page, copy the address.</li>\n<li>Paste the address into google, and click on the Google Maps widget/result. Zoom in and out. Use 3D, use StreetView.</li>\n<li>Open a Pull Request on Github. Read the code for about a minute.</li>\n<li>Open Discord, check my posts about donating to \"<a href=\"https://drazevacshelter.org/en/\">drazevac shelter</a>\" on two spaces.</li>\n<li>Open a <a href=\"https://www.dr.dk\">Danish News</a> website, click on an article, copy URL.</li>\n<li>Open Google Translate, paste the URL and click on the result. This will open a new, translated page. Spend 3 minutes slowly reading the article.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Calculation:</h1>\n<p>The output of powermetrics looks similar to Activity monitor, but lists only the top offenders. It also creates averages in a rolling time window, and I've used the 15minute averages. I've always discarded the system/kernel processes which had very stabile usage anyway. I have added up all the processes that belong to an individual browser, including various workers, video encoders, tab containers etc. Overall, most of the power usage always belonged to the tabs themselves, apart from Chrome, where the App process itself was averaging between 400 and 1000. The shape of data (while writing this) is below.</p>\n<pre><code>**** Average cumulatively decayed power score ****\n\n                                            15 sec           1 min\ncom.apple.WebKit.WebContent            33.3628      27.592\nWindowServer                           14.3019     8.72686\nTerminal                                13.814     11.0305\nSafari                                 5.74578     4.42689\npowermetrics                            5.2907     4.38439\nkernel_task                            2.23776     1.73242\ncom.apple.WebKit.Networking           0.837266    0.872574\nlaunchd                               0.364388    0.250244\n</code></pre>\n<p>&#x200B;</p></div>",

            "content_html": "<caption>Open: <a href='https://reddit.com/r/macapps/comments/129joyn/arc_vs_safari_energy_usage_benchmark/'>Reddit</a></caption><div><br></div><div><p>Heya gang, recently I've gotten hooked to Arc and the way it looks and works. God damn am I going to miss it.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, what we all know is true, was true. It is a huge hog due to Chromium. I've been unable to find any concrete numbers on Chrome vs Safari vs Arc etc, apart from random Redditor's anecdotal evidence.</p>\n<p>For me, it is crucial that the browser is optimised. Thats a bit vague, so let's put it like this - I am sick of years of warm CPUs, loud fans, and 60min battery spans. I don't really care if \"technically\" it might be optimised, i care only about a real world feeling. Thus, after a bit of deliberation I dropped all CPU/RAM/GPU metrics, and decided to go with Apple's own POWER. Unfortunately I don't know how to get \"Energy Impact\" from Activity Monitor into a more readable format, so I used the next closest thing Apple gave us:</p>\n<pre><code>sudo powermetrics -i 1000 --poweravg 1 | grep 'Average cumulatively decayed power score' -A 20\n</code></pre>\n<p>I've replicated four 20min long tests as close as I could. While they may not be scientific, I don't really care, I just wanted to see some stabile numbers. I did these steps as close as I humanly could (i hope someone makes a script to automate this sort of tests lol):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Clean restart, 100% battery, nothing else running</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Watch a 6min long 4K@60 HDR on youtube, in full screen</p>\n</li>\n<li>Put a HD yt video of Hasan making fun of Trumps lawyers in PiP (while doing all other tasks below)</li>\n<li>Find a local restaurant on Google Maps, use StreetView and 3D view, browse photos.</li>\n<li>Find the GitHub Page of Elixir's Porcelain, then browse their docs.</li>\n<li>Use Google Translate to read a major Danish news website in English.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>The results were sad. I grouped up all relevant processes that were impacted by these actions, excluding networking and audio. Safari was fairly stabile on both initial runs (and I even saw zero improvement when using HTML video tags with Baking soda and Vinegar extensions instead of YouTube player, on the third run)</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>Safari</code> without extensions -- 155</li>\n<li><code>Safari</code> without extensions -- 158</li>\n<li><code>Safari</code> with HTML video -- 162</li>\n<li><code>Arc</code> without extensions -- 538</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\ud83d\ude22</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><strong>Update 2h later:</strong></p>\n<p>After some comments elsewhere, I tried to isolate the videos, since they may skew the results by draining way more than normal pages, we expected to see smaller scores. Instead of videos I did a bunch more browsing on Google, Wiki, Maps and news sites. So, way more pages opened and closed. Oh boy were we wrong...</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>Arc</code> - 1149</li>\n<li><code>Safari</code> - 78</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This does seem like the Reddit comments elsewhere are correct in that its not only Chromium, but Arc isn't doing some cleaning that it probably should be doing.</p></div>",

WriteMage works in any macOS app, floating on top like Apple Spotlight. Activated by a single keystroke.</p>\n<p>Whether you want to find terminal command, explain Swift code, thinking of google sheets formula, translate to Chinese. It has you covered in any app!</p>\n<p><strong># Privacy + 100% between you and OpenAI + All your chat history is saved locally</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/oalpv0dzi3qa1.gif\">Your own data, We see nothing</a></p>\n<p>I place a high value on your privacy. When this app is running and \"you are <strong>using your own API key</strong>\", it will only connect to the OpenAI server. I have decided not to include telemetry (bug tracker), even in the beta. At app launch, it checks for version updates as well. However, this only happens during app launch and no data is transferred back to my server.</p>\n<p><strong># Custom Prompt + Prompt Library :</strong> You can add your own prompt or download more from our prompt library.</p>\n<p><strong># GPT-4 compatible! :</strong> Use your own API key and choose GPT-4 in the settings to switch the model.</p>\n<p>Right now it's free to use during beta (no paywall, no nagging, <strong>please just give me feedbacks \ud83d\ude02</strong>) but you can support me by buying full license with beta discount (available until the final version is released next month)</p>\n<p>Download link &amp; more info : <a href=\"https://writemage.com\">https://writemage.com</a></p>\n<p>Any suggestion/question is welcome!</p>\n<p>Thanks for macapps sub this is my first mac app post in Reddit!</p>\n<p>If you like it, an upvote is appreciated \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83e\udd79</p></div>",

I have implemented this new API in 5.2.3. I had one person tell me it still wasn't working, so you may need to manually remove Amphetamine from your Login Items in \uf8ff \u2192 System Settings \u2192 General \u2192 Login Items. If you have multiple copies/versions of Amphetamine installed on your Mac, you may need to remove all but the beta, which should be installed in the /Applications folder. If you're running a macOS version prior to Ventura, this doesn't apply to you.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><strong>Closed-Display Mode on Apple Silicon</strong></p>\n<p>With Apple Silicon, the API that Amphetamine used to keep your Mac awake while in closed-display mode stopped working. I opened a bug report/ticket with Apple, but Apple told me tough luck - that's how things are now. Anyways, I've implemented a new mechanism for closed-display mode on Apple Silicon. Unfortunately, starting/ending a closed-display mode session now requires user authentication. If you have Touch ID on your Mac, it's fairly painless to quickly authenticate. Sorry - this is the only way to achieve this on Apple Silicon (that I know of). Intel Macs are not affected.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><strong>Battery Functions on M2</strong></p>\n<p>All of the battery related settings didn't work on M2 Macs. I've fixed this (hopefully).</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><strong>Other</strong></p>\n<p>\u2022 French localization has been added (proof-reading/corrections are likely needed, however). To test French localization, see <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/change-the-system-language-mh26684/mac\">this article</a> from Apple about how to choose the language you use for individual apps.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Preferences/Quick Preferences  (and references to them) have been renamed Settings/Quick Settings for macOS Ventura (and future versions). </p>\n<p>\u2022 If you have an issue where your Mac goes to sleep or your display cuts out immediately upon starting/stopping a session, you can try running the following command in Terminal, after installing the beta. Make sure to relaunch Amphetamine. Would really appreciate hearing back from anyone who can test this. </p>\n<pre><code>defaults write com.if.Amphetamine 'Disable All CDM Functions' -bool YES\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you have feedback, additional bug reports, you may post it here. I'll try to get as many things fixed/updated as possible with this release. Thank you!</p></div>",

I will continue expanding Klack with additional switches over time, hoping to get a solid set of 20+ switches soon enough.

            "content_html": "<caption>Open: <a href='https://reddit.com/r/macapps/comments/11wyjz9/we_need_to_talk_about_rewind/'>Reddit</a></caption><div><br></div><div><p>Recently, on the capitalist hustle hellscape that is Product Hunt, I came across a new app called <strong>Rewind</strong>. <a href=\"https://www.rewind.ai/\">Rewind</a>, as described by founder Dan Siroker, is a search engine for your life - it runs in the background, recording everything you do, click on, view, compresses it and OCR's it so you can invoke it at any time and search for what you're looking for. It's a bit like insurance - you'll probably not use it very much, but if you ever need it, you'll be glad that it's there.</p>\n<p>Back when I discovered it, in December of 22, it was in Early Access and could only be accessed over a waitlist. Being the seasoned Mac App Bullshit veteran I am, I entered my email. A few weeks later, I received the early access email - I was in! Quickly I went to the website and looked for the download link.</p>\n<p>Instead of a download link, it presented me with a purchase flow. Rewind costs - or rather, did cost - 20 US dollars a month. </p>\n<p>Now, I'm not stranger to paying for a good app. Far from it, in fact! I paid for the Affinity suite, I paid for iA, I paid for a lot of good apps that improve my workflow. Do I think it's a bit stupid that an app like CleanShot is charging for the privilege of screenshots? Lasso for a feature that's free on Windows, and built in by now? Sure, but developers need to eat too. And an app like Rewind, sure, all that analysis and encryption and compression needs a strong server backend, so I get it. They need to cover the costs.</p>\n<p>But here's the thing - they don't. Rewind, as far as I can tell, is a completely local app. It runs on your machine, doesn't send anything to the cloud, all your data stays on your machine. You can even box it in with a firewall and it does not complain, care, or even notice.</p>\n<p>Which brings me back to the earlier point. Rewind, a completely local app that works absolutely fine in its current state and is a lot more stable than basically any other Early Access app I've tried, charges 20 bucks a month for something that would continue working forever if a meteor took out Rewind HQ tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Or, actually, correct that. Not 20 bucks. It's now changed the pricing - there's a free trial now, great success, and they lowered the price to 10 a month. Only catch: <strong>If you choose the 10 dollar a month tier, they limit how many times you are allowed to open this local app on your own computer.</strong> If you want unlimited, better choke up another 20. Yeah, you read right: <em>Another</em> 20. The Pro plan is 30 dollars now. But hey, at least you get the CEO's phone number. What? That's gotta be up there as the weirdest benefit I've seen on a pricing page.</p>\n<p>I'm not supporting this. I can't. I love the idea, and as someone with memory issues, it's a great feature that I've wanted for years - and were it 30, maybe 50, probably even 100 dollars, I'd've gladly paid it. But this? Subscriptions for local apps that don't need any serverside maintenance, ever, by design? It's an insult to the customer.</p>\n<p>Actually, scratch that. The <em>actual</em> insult to the customer is that, in an email, the founder admitted to me that the high price is \"priced on the value, not on the cost\". Brilliant! What's next, food prices rise based on how good of a meal I could make with the ingredients? Gas prices that get higher if I drive a car that gets better mileage? In a now deleted FAQ, the CEO admitted that it's to \"filter out low-priority tech support requests\". Wow, what a load of arrogant horseshit, if you pardon my French.</p>\n<p>It's a shame to see macOS embracing this more and more. Subscriptions everywhere, hidden fees, In-App purchases. Yes, developers need to eat. Yes, good software should cost money, that's not the issue. The issue is when you push so far you alienate and insult your customers.</p>\n<p>I hope someone else comes along and puts them in competition. Brilliant idea, great execution, absolutely appalling corporate structure.</p></div>",

I decided to create an app to make life easier for me.</p>\n<p>Signal Shifter is a tiny application that lives in the Menu Bar.</p>\n<p>The application creates a complete list of your input audio devices, output audio devices and Bluetooth devices that can be used as audio input or output.

The whole <a href=\"https://github.com/p0deje/Maccy/releases/tag/0.26.0\">changelog</a> is in GitHub and some of the new features are making it a way more powerful tool that needs a bit more explanation, so I've decided to write this post, though I'm not sure if Reddit is the best place for this.</p>\n<p><strong>Regexp search</strong></p>\n<p>One of the oldest requested features from 2020 (<a href=\"https://github.com/p0deje/Maccy/issues/184\">p0deje/Maccy#184</a>). It's now possible to use regular expressions in the search - it looks like this and uses Swift's regular expression engine.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/08i37ne0e4oa1.png?width=1444&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=67d356e73b0fe544477398f6f9b29b010a97b6ab\">Regexp search</a></p>\n<p><strong>Mixed search</strong></p>\n<p>It's not convenient to go to preferences to change search mode (exact/fuzzy/regexp) so there is now an experimental mixed search that attempts to go from the most to the least exact mode. </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Try to find exact matches using the search term.</li>\n<li>If there are no exact matches, switch to the fuzzy search.</li>\n<li>If there are no fuzzy matches, switch to the regexp search.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This way I can find the best results via the exact search, but also make accidental typos because the fuzzy search kicks in, or just use plain regular expressions as a search term.</p>\n<p><strong>Get Copy from Maccy History in the Shortcuts.app</strong></p>\n<p>One of my favorite features is the ability to use the Shortcuts.app to retrieve items from Maccy history by index or selection. It's possible to get different content from them (rich text, plain text, HTML, images, etc). This allows to do fancy processing of the copied items, here are some examples:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/xego025mf4oa1.png?width=2124&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=21053237c8654cb17cdf5db3760468cb0f34f1a2\">Trim whitespace from the selected item in Maccy and paste by pressing \u2325\u2318.</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/m8whczptf4oa1.png?width=2112&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=dcbd352b70283b5f898bdcc78bd0730720d90901\">Convert the selected RTF item in Maccy to Markdown and paste by pressing \u2325\u2318,</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ghwr4jwbg4oa1.png?width=2030&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=81455b31e013d6431a06a7004ce0a3a3137173b6\">Save the most recent 10 items from Maccy to CSV</a></p>\n<p><strong>Compatibility with Pure Paste</strong></p>\n<p>There is a wonderful <a href=\"https://sindresorhus.com/pure-paste\">Pure Paste</a> application by u/sindresorhus that strips formatting from copied content. Maccy is now fully compatible with it and ensures that the recorded copies take into account modifications made by Pure Paste.</p></div>",

This emulates Windows functionality on a Mac.  I realize this has been discussed in the past and that Command+Q will close an app.  Not trying to get into the debate about whether or not this functionality is better or worse than the default Mac behavior of leaving *most applications open even if they have no windows. The reasoning for this app is purely personal preference.  I like having only the applications I'm currently working in open and also prefer an uncluttered application switcher.  There have been a number of challenges in getting this application to work correctly and some users have reported an issue with some applications quitting immediately upon opening.  What I'm looking for are some users to test the new version 1.5 and report on whether or not they experience any of the same type of issue.  If you are interested in this type of functionality and want to help test you can download Swift Quit at <a href=\"https://swiftquit.com\">https://swiftquit.com</a>.  The project is open source and available on <a href=\"https://github.com/onebadidea/swiftquit\">Github</a>.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/w2tg2989qwna1.png?width=920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=150096d7346a62e73cb595f17ca8a61f6b664c43</p></div>",
