I recently made a very big change to the UI to give you more flexibility in reviewing your cards.</p>\n<p>I got a lot of feedback that people wanted to review outside of the regular spaced repetition schedule. This new version updates the UI so you get a WYSIWYG playlist for card review. The playlist is sorted based on your review history and current review mode. You can sort by due date, scheduled by spaced repetition; by last review, for cram-style review; or even by difficulty.</p>\n<p>The app syncs with iCloud and can be used on iOS as well. One-time purchase, no subscriptions!</p>\n<p>More details here as well: <a href=\"https://www.ussherpress.com/freshcards/\">https://www.ussherpress.com/freshcards/</a></p></div>",

All links are at <a href=\"https://loshadki.app/openin/\">OpenIn</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Quick note, if you have never heard about OpenIn before. It handles files and links on your mac, and redirect them to the preferred application based on rules, or shows you app selection dialog so you can choose which browser you want to use or app for a file. You can open mailto links in Google Mail in the browser, you can open notion links in the Notion app, you can open zoom meetings in the zoom app without going to the browser. You can remove tracking query params like <code>utm_</code> and <code>uta_</code> from links. You can open xcodeproj in Sublime by telling it to open the folder instead of the file. And there is a lot more!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Please read the announcement <a href=\"https://loshadki.app/blog/2021-12-01-openin-v3/\">OpenIn - Version 3</a>, I have included also a section \"How Author of OpenIn uses OpenIn\" so you can see a small example how OpenIn can be configured to make you more productive on your mac!</p>\n<p>There are a LOT of new features!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>New redesigned interface for rules</li>\n<li>Auto-resolve shortened URLs</li>\n<li>Backup and restore</li>\n<li>Writing custom scripts with JavaScript </li>\n<li>Share Extension</li>\n<li>And more!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As a celebration for publishing v3, I am running a promotion on App Store, 40% off ($5.99 instead of $9.99). </p>\n<p>This is a free upgrade for v1/v2 users. More than that, if you did not have Pro features before, now you have them. I have removed In-App-Purchases, seems it confused a lot of people.</p>\n<p>Note about macOS Catalina, I dropped support for Catalina in v3, but you can now download v2 for macOS Catalina from our website for free! v3 only works on Big Sur and Monterey. </p>\n<p>Btw, just a history about OpenIn:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In the beginning I made OpenIn free, and only charged for Pro features. But I got a lot of fake reviews. Probably targeted by some scam applications like \"Open In Pro\" (this app is a free download with a lot of 5 starts reviews, and requires you to purchase In-App-Purchase to use it, and as I understand it only allows you to change default browser). To protect reviews of OpenIn - I have changed it to be a paid app and kept Pro features as In-App-Purchase. </li>\n<li>OpenIn v2 was for a while 4.99 for the app, and 4.99 for Pro features. But for some reason, some users just don't like In-App-Purchases. Got a lot of emails about that.</li>\n<li>OpenIn v3 is 9.99 for everything, no In-App-Purchases are required. Which means if you downloaded v1 a while ago, it is free and you got v3 for free with all the features. If you purchased v2 without Pro features, now you got them.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And if you read till that point. 10 Promo Codes (if you take one, please post in the comment which one you took). I will post more codes (up to 50 in total) later if this post will get more votes.  </p>\n<ul>\n<li>~~LH9W3HKRRK7J~~</li>\n<li>~~XYP67RH3ME9F~~</li>\n<li>WHMYHRMWATPY</li>\n<li>~~KXKKYK6TWALL~~</li>\n<li>~~H6A6ELEFARTY~~</li>\n<li>~~6EM7HLPT3ARF~~</li>\n<li>~~XFWTLLX6HYK3~~</li>\n<li>~~KR3MYWTPLM36~~</li>\n<li>~~MXJK69X4K773~~</li>\n<li>~~KY96JXMEL93R~~</li>\n</ul></div>",

The frustration is that there are so many apps out there, and many of them are garbage. Like buying a mattress, it seems like every review out there is incomplete or paid for by one of them. So I decided to install all the serious PDF readers/editors I could find and spend half the day looking for the best option. Hope this helps someone, as I've seen plenty of posts looking in the past. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pCt75tHayO_QJO2swREcZEgAFEhrm9-3pnDogh5kpRM\">PDF Reader Comparison Spreadsheet</a></p>\n<p>I don't claim perfection, so if I missed something, please let me know and I'll correct it.

I am indie developer, just cannot have ability to test and support 2 versions behind. Also it is getting pretty hard to get access to older versions of macOS with M1.</p>\n<p>But I am not going to leave macOS Catalina users, for them I have provided a free version that is available from our <a href=\"https://loshadki.app/openin/#is-openin-available-on-macos-catalina-1015x\">website</a>. It is the last currently available version of OpenIn on app store (with just one fix for numeric keyboard).</p>\n<p>I am going to open a beta testing for OpenIn vNext soon, if you are interested, please subscribe to our newsletter (at the bottom of the page https://loshadki.app). I do not share emails with anybody, and send only announcements (probably sent 2-3 emails this year). One important detail about beta testing, it is going to be available via TestFlight for macOS, so you have to be on Monterey to participate. </p>\n<p>And the last thing, app is for $1.99 (instead of $4.99), Pro features are 2.99 (instead of $4.99) until November 30 (early Black Friday, Cyber Monday deal).</p>\n<p>Enjoy! Feedback and suggestions are always welcome! Work has started!</p></div>",

Just follow the very simple on-screen indications to very easily start the bootable macOS installer creation process.</p>\n<p>- Fully open: You can see how this programs works and you can freely contribute to it! (<a href=\"https://github.com/ITzTravelInTime/TINU\">https://github.com/ITzTravelInTime/TINU</a>)</p>\n<p>- Support for multiple languages (currently just italian and english, but more will be added with future updates)</p>\n<p>- Can work with every macOS installer app that has the `createinstallmedia` executable inside its internal resources folder (including also beta and newly released installers).</p>\n<p>- 100% clean using the official apple's method: The bootable macOS installers created with this tool are made using the official apple's `createinstallmedia` method, just as if you created them using the command line, this ensures the best and the cleanest results avoiding all the problems that modded installers have.</p>\n<p>- Does not require any special preparations. Just open the program, make sure you have a big enought USB drive plugged in (see the `Requirements` section) and have a macOS installer app on your disk.</p>\n<p>- No need to use Disk Utility first. TINU can format your drive or partition for you, if it's necessary.</p>\n<p>- Integrated downloads from Apple for lots of macOS/OS X installer apps (to access them open the app, go to the menu bar, and then `Tools-&gt;Download a macOS installer`).</p>\n<p>- Integrated EFI partition mounter tool for advanced users.</p>\n<p>- Tested to work on all the latest macOS releases.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Requirements:</p>\n<p>- A computer that runs Mac OS X Yosemite or a more recent version.</p>\n<p>- A drive or a free partition of least 8 GB (9+ for Catalina, 12+ for Big Sur and newer versions) that you want to turn into a macOS/Mac OS X installer (NOTE: partitions are usable only if they belong to a drive which uses the GUID partition format).</p>\n<p>- A copy of a macOS/Mac OS X installer app (only Maveriks or newer versions are supported), it's reccommended to have the app placed into the /Applications folder or in the root of a volume connected to your computer (excepted the drive/volume you want to turn into your macOS install media).</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Download:</p>\n<p>- You can download the app here from the official github releses page: <a href=\"https://github.com/ITzTravelInTime/TINU/releases\">https://github.com/ITzTravelInTime/TINU/releases</a></p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Check out the source code on github:</p>\n<p>- <a href=\"https://github.com/ITzTravelInTime/TINU\">https://github.com/ITzTravelInTime/TINU</a></p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Screenshots:</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/p5by4a8iuyv71.png?width=1464&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=18de6ef992080d68e883ccc232dfa843163eabd4\">Main menu</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/l5gvic8iuyv71.png?width=1464&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f02175a2d830a6c3ccfa28d1c7cf238048123de0\">Requirements screen</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ckj29g8iuyv71.png?width=1464&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87128e98b27a6e0647df6c825cd60d4c980843e8\">Drive select screen</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/yuxs0s8iuyv71.png?width=1464&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb70d7b4a3ddab76d53869c103f6cd287bd97a8f\">Installer app select screen</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/gbwz4s8iuyv71.png?width=1464&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=65f866925cb33acde23ac286fcd8aa5cf48f57e1\">Confirmation screen</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/mhgwos8iuyv71.png?width=1464&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1de4bc6b8f77b23cf699d5bf5368e757af48e04\">Drive creation screen</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/hq7bwe8iuyv71.png?width=256&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=82ad21cd32f8de3fb8512a5b2df354f6a0a7494a\">TINU's icon</a></p>\n<p>NOTE: The icons in the screenshots will be used only if you are running macOS Big Sur and newer versions, for older OSes some alternative system icons will be used.</p></div>",

I know this kicked off a hunt for 1Password alternatives at the time, but to date, my company has yet to find a suitable alternative for storing passwords, software licenses and secure notes in a post-1Password7 world.</p>\n<p>With both a new release of 1Password <em>and</em> a new version of MacOS looming, we're starting to feel the pressure, as we have <em>years</em> of information stored in locally secured and synched vaults that simply <em>cannot</em> be uploaded to Agilebits' cloud service for future use. For now, we're continuing to use 1Password 7 as always, but eventually (maybe not soon, but inevitably some day), <em>something</em> will change in the MacOS security model or other software SDKs that will render 1P7 incompatible with new software. We can't wait for the \"This application cannot be opened...\" dialog to appear, so we're trying to get ahead of this now.</p>\n<p>Basically, we need to ensure that we can continue to do the following, as once 1Password moves on to Version 8, it will no longer meet <em>all</em> these criteria for us:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Store secure notes, credit cards, software licenses, site logins and passwords. (This eliminates using <em>Apple Keychain</em> alone)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Use locally stored files or self-hosted services within an organizations' own network and behind a firewall. (This eliminates cloud-only services such as <em>Dashlane</em> and, tragically, <em>1Password 8+</em>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Use, synch and share <em>multiple</em> vaults among different users. (This eliminates newcomers <em>Simple</em>, <em>Minimal</em> and a few other Mac-only password managers I've looked at to date)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Usable by both technically-minded <em>and</em> non-tech-savvy users (which seems to be a big stumbling block for the many <em>KeepPass</em>-based solutions I've tried so far)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It's a tough request, but these are all things that 1Password has handled well for us for the past decade, but has decided not to continue doing, so... desperate times, I guess.</p>\n<p>That said... Anybody found anything that checks all these boxes yet? Thanks!</p></div>",

I also liked Dropover\u2019s shake cursor feature but it appears like Yoink doesn\u2019t have that. (Could it be replicated using BetterTouchTool maybe?)</p>\n<p>So which is better in your opinion for dragging files, pictures into a temporary shelf? I know ultimately it\u2019s \u201cwhat works best for you\u201d but I\u2019m curious to see what people are using.</p>\n<p>Only seeking opinions for these two apps, no \u201cdon\u2019t see the point of these apps\u201d types posts please.</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance!</p></div>",
