A little preview of <a href=\"https://taptab.manibatra.xyz\">Tap Tab</a>. The web extension APIs for managing tabs are pretty locked down in Safari, but I have already found a lot of value in using the extension. Some of the features that I find very useful(in the middle of building a few of these) : \n-   Driven by keyboard shortcuts. I can see the tabs I have open at a glance and switch between them.\n-   Fuzzy search to quickly filter down to the tab you want. \n-   Quick switching between two tabs.\n-   Ability to pin, mute, and close the tab right from the extension.</p>\n<p>Say hello, and tell me what features you would like the extension to have!!</p></div>",

Since then, I gave it a bit more work and put it on the Mac App Store, and updated it to fit the requests of its users.</p>\n<p>This week, I released TouchRuler 2.0, which includes tons of features that will make your measurements faster and more precise than ever before; such as numbers on the ruler for at a glance measurements, the Control Row for quick adjustments, the Click Pad for precision measurements that can go right into your clipboard, and more.</p>\n<p>This release also adds TouchRuler mini, a handy little widget that maintains the customisation and precision that TouchRuler has, all while resting in your Notification Center. You can even drag it out of the Notification Center at any time across your Mac to measure anything you're working on in a flash.</p>\n<p>TouchRuler fits right at home on any Mac, but when paired with a MacBook Pro, you can measure any real-world object with ease right from your Touch Bar!</p>\n<p>With colourful themes, precision automatic and manual calibration, and of course an elegant ruler for your Touch Bar and Notification Center; TouchRuler is a fun spin on other rulers on the App Store and of course the generic plastic rulers floating around, all while retaining the same utility that you'd expect on any other ruler.</p>\n<p>TouchRuler is great for designers, architects, students, scientists, mathematicians, and the rest of us who just need a ruler available to access wherever we are.</p>\n<p>You don't have to take my word for it, TouchRuler has also been featured in <a href=\"https://www.ifun.de/touchruler-lineal-fuer-den-mac-bildschirm-und-die-touch-bar-176304/\">ifun.de</a> and <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/products/touchruler#touchruler\">Product Hunt</a>!</p>\n<p>You can grab it on the Mac App Store for less than the price of a physical ruler (one that doesn't have all the cool tricks TouchRuler has!), at just $0.99USD!</p>\n<p>Tell me what you think, I'm open for feedback, and answering any questions regarding the app! I hope you all like it, if so please feel free to leave TouchRuler a review on the App Store! There's also ten free codes available in the comments section! Thanks for checking out TouchRuler!</p>\n<p>App Store link: <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/touchruler/id1581679817\">https://apps.apple.com/us/app/touchruler/id1581679817</a></p>\n<p>Check out my other work here: <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/davidmazzeo\">https://sites.google.com/view/davidmazzeo</a></p></div>",

Follow the link for details, a screencast (4 min), and download. (this is paid feature, but there is a no signup 7 day trial so you can play with it)</p>\n<p>In the past I have used plain text formats (like .taskpaper and .markdown) for my apps. I've grown sick of seeing and parsing syntax characters, so this time around I am taking a rich text approach.</p>\n<p>Rich text looks clean, but editing is problematic. You don't have precise control/visibility into the formatting. It's hidden behind the text. There are no formatting characters to guide you like you have in Markdown. This is particularly problematic when you want to insert text at formatting boundaries.</p>\n<p>Bike solves this with \"typing affinity\". This lets you precisely specify which formatting to use at those boundaries. It does this by adding an extra text caret state at these boundaries. This extra state allows you to point the text caret upstream or downstream to the formatting you want.</p>\n<p>Other interesting features include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Link Buttons: Insert a dedicated \"open\" button after each link so there is no conflict between editing link text and opening the link.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Keyboard Centric Formatting Popover: Remember a single keyboard shortcut and have full keyboard access to formatting commands. No mouse needed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Visible Typing Attributes: Show hidden typing attribute state (when it cannot be visually determined by looking at surrounding text) as part of the text caret.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please take a look and let me know what you think. I'm happy to answer questions and would love to hear your thoughts on ways to improve rich text editing further.</p></div>",

I have been a user of Alfred for quite a long time and I installed Raycast the other day, out of curiosity. I find it quite cool and there are some interesting ideas in the app. I'm a web developer so the ability of quickly building extensions using React is quite great for me. The only thing I'm missing, though, and that is quite the dealbreaker is Universal Actions. The ability to select something as context and then start Alfred to act upon that context is really useful. Is there anything similar to that in Raycast?</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Thx!</p></div>",

Over the years, I've recommended their apps to friends, family, &amp; many more. I am heavily invested in their apps with my workflows. </p>\n<p>I\u2019ve updated Spark on iOS &amp; iPadOS and those are solid upgrades with a few great new features. But what happened to the v3 version for macOS? My gut reaction was that we Mac users got thrown under the bus to make Spark work on Windows via an electron app.</p>\n<p>Let me explain what I mean. <br />\n(Everything below is also in this Craft doc \u21e8 <a href=\"https://www.craft.do/s/AoGwif29ATqkKc\">https://www.craft.do/s/AoGwif29ATqkKc</a> which might be easier to read.)</p>\n<p><strong>[1]</strong> \ud83d\udc49\ufe0f<strong>Swiping actions</strong> are gone. Touchpads are now only useful for scrolling now but nothing else \ud83d\ude22 I use a trackpad on both the MacBook &amp; Desktop macs with the same swipe settings as on my iOS &amp; iPadOS devices. Is this a permanent change?</p>\n<p><strong>[2]</strong> Where did the <strong>column view</strong> go? The way to navigate is now unbearably \ud83e\udda5 slower without it. </p>\n<p><strong>[3]</strong> <strong>Services integrations</strong> \ud83d\ude45 are no more? I heavily use them with v2\u2026 now all of them are gone in v3? Now what? </p>\n<p><strong>[4]</strong> <strong>Composing e-mails</strong> \u270d\ufe0f\u2709\ufe0f now has only 2 options: full-screen and compact. Compact cannot be resized or popped out. What gives? Then when on the new \"Home\" screen, the compact compose view blocks \u2b1b\ufe0f almost completely the\u00a0\"Open Inbox\" button. This is not usable in this state.</p>\n<p><strong>[5]</strong> No more \ud83c\udf2c\ufe0f <strong>font options</strong>? No more \ud83c\udf2c\ufe0f <strong>font sizes</strong>?</p>\n<p><strong>[6]</strong> <strong>Multi-tasking</strong> \ud83e\udd39 is in the past? There is no way to compose two e-mails at the same time now. This might work for people who barely write emails but for those relying on it heavily this is not just making it cumbersome but it is a deal breaker.</p>\n<p><strong>[6]</strong> Idle <strong>CPU Time</strong> \ud83d\udca4 usage comparison. Both apps were opened to the same draft email &amp; minimized to the dock for 20 minutes. Remarkably, <strong>\u2460</strong> v2 used a \u2155 of the resources or in other words <strong>\u2461</strong> v3 used x5 more.</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/78u41ujzz5s91.png?width=1482&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be2165700c935dc80bd451ffb44dbcd010a4c1d9</p>\n<p><strong>[7]</strong> What is the \u201c<strong>Home</strong>\" \ud83c\udfda\ufe0f screen really useful for? It takes extra clicks now to get to my inbox, I get a new image shown and I have no say in what it is. </p>\n<p><strong>[8]</strong> The <strong>menu popovers</strong> \ud83d\udde8 are crazy big, attention grabbing &amp; in the way.</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/47bi9xk606s91.png?width=1082&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7596418dd76afd5f70696c6366cb1549489af21</p>\n<p><strong>[9]</strong> Native macOS <strong>smooth scrolling</strong> \ud83d\udcdc is now gone. It's a small thing but when you scroll all the time, it is a noticeable omission. Same applies to <strong>window resizing</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>[10]</strong> The new <strong>minimum compose window size</strong> is unnecessarily large. Spark v3 minimum screen area is x2.5 larger than of Spark v2.</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/xhaa4vga06s91.png?width=582&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=744baab854d5a8530468506a73ec86ab2132a685</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/wviwqquc06s91.png?width=1282&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f03518dc4db3f8f9a4a63f577c0bbe693e7fcf6</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/ggcu4qee06s91.png?width=1090&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8cfe0805e70c4cb82e971e4b9d2099014b374af3</p>\n<p><strong>[11]</strong> Wasted <strong>empty space</strong> \ud83d\uddd1\ufe0f is unfortunately all over the UI. Just the left side in Spark v3 is 106pt &amp; only 31pt in Spark v2.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/3t3f1q6g06s91.png?width=370&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4b4f3fc08de41c2e2232322758f38b745bdb10c2</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/fuid1i7h06s91.png?width=191&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e9153352fa9e73a9b62b6e13793332f88020207d</p>\n<p><strong>[12]</strong> Last but far from least, <strong>templates</strong>, where \ud83d\udd0e are they in v3?</p>\n<p>So, the way things stand, \u2728Spark 2\u2728 is better and I cannot switch over to v3 on macOS like I did on my iOS/iPadOS devices. That begs the question, how can this be the new Spark? What is the expected support timeframe for v2? When will it be sunset/discontinued?</p>\n<p>Curious what other Spark users think about this big change/departure from v2 to v3.</p></div>",

Keep in mind that I want to mainly feature apps that have broad appeal. There are a lot of developer apps, for example, that I feel are too niche.

In that time, everything was working perfectly. Just enter the url of youtube link and press enter, no login, nothing.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Fast forward in 2020/1/2 Company introduces the Airy, a separate app for downloading Youtube videos and removes the feature from the page and do not notify any paid customer about feature removal</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://mac.eltima.com/download-manager.html\">https://mac.eltima.com/download-manager.html</a></p>\n<p>Here is release notes page of the app which never even mention feature removal:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://help.electronic.us/support/solutions/articles/44002276858-what-s-new-in-this-version-of-folx\">https://help.electronic.us/support/solutions/articles/44002276858-what-s-new-in-this-version-of-folx</a></p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>They first started by making it annoying to use Folx. e.g., asking you to log in in a internal browser page with a suggestion to buy Airy instead (which is weird, hey I paid for that feature, are you asking to pay again for the same feature?). The internal browser itself is also separate from your own browser session. However, even if you were logging in it would not work. </p>\n<p>Recently, they just went one step further and completely disabled the feature, no more youtube video download pop up. Nothing, it just try to download a html page. </p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>This to me is very disturbing behavior from the company and I believe that you as customer should know about shady practices of this company. Now, for me while the money is not a problem, and there are plenty of open source alternatives, the company behavior is disturbing and I would never buy any software from this company anymore.</p></div>",
