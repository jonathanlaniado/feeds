I've been an Alfred user for years. However, for the sake of fairness, curiosity, and always searching for something better and more efficient, I decided to install Raycast and compare since anyone who has been on r/macapps for a while may know that that's <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/macapps/comments/13c1c7m/master_list_of_definitive_app_comparisons_view/\">a hobby</a>. </p>\n<p>Here are some considerations to keep in mind: </p>\n<p><strong>Your Privacy in Their</strong> <strong>Privacy Policies.</strong><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.alfredapp.com/terms/\"><strong>Alfred</strong></a> - Privacy-conscious. <em>Alfred is the product.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Alfred only contacts our server when activating your Powerpack license  in order to validate it, as well as periodically checking for new  software updates.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.raycast.com/privacy\"><strong>Raycast</strong></a> - <em>You are the product.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We use Personal Data for the following purposes...<br />\nTo analyze how you interact with our Service...<br />\nTo maintain and improve the content and functionality of the Service...<br />\nTo develop new products and services...<br />\nTo tell you about products or services we believe may be of interest to you... <br />\nReason: For our legitimate interests or those of a third party, i.e. to promote our business to you...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Efficiency Considerations.</strong><br />\nAccording to my usage history, I trigger Alfred about 42 times daily, or 15,330 times yearly.</p>\n<p>In Raycast, every search is stalled behind a menu that needs to be triggered unless you configure an additional shortcut for each feature. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Want to search for a file? Gotta select the option first and hit enter to begin searching.</li>\n<li>Want to perform an action on the file? Yet another shortcut (CMD+K).</li>\n<li>Want to trigger any other feature? You guessed it, another shortcut or menu to trigger first.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That's an additional 2\u20135 seconds <em>every single search</em> or 8.5\u201321 <em>HOURS</em> a year for something Alfred can do immediately on the first trigger. Am I missing something here? </p>\n<p><strong>Appearance.</strong> <br />\nThe Raycast preferences and user interface is the clear winner in terms of eyecandy, no arguments to be had. Alfred could learn from this, though Alfred has more granular customizable preferences. </p>\n<p><strong>Complexity.</strong><br />\nBecause Raycast has a cleaner design, it can be easier to find what you're looking for if you're not a power user. </p>\n<p><strong>Feature offerings.</strong><br />\nThis is basically a tie for the most common features\u2014E.g., web/file searches, clipboard history, calculator, notes, links, etc.<br />\nThe recent AI integration with Raycast is the major distinction ($10/month or $96/yr <a href=\"https://www.raycast.com/pricing\">subscription</a>). <br />\nOne can also use the API from OpenAI with an Alfred workflow with Powerpack ($42 <a href=\"https://www.alfredapp.com/shop/\">license</a>). </p>\n<p>Ultimately, we all have to consider and decide what we care about most. <br />\nWhat unique features, considerations, or tips have I missed that stand out for why you prefer one over the other?</p></div>",

I use this for my collection of academic notes, which I prefer to keep local-first. Nota looks much nicer, and is much more suited to handling a large collection. Obsidian has far more features, but I don't need most of them anyway, and hopefully Nota will continue to evolve.</p>\n<p>Finally a shoutout to Scrivener, which I have been using for a while now and continue to enjoy.

Seriously, you've been amazing and super helpful.</p>\n<p><strong>TLDR: These are NOT performance tests. I only measure raw power usage!!!!!!</strong> Each browser was tested 3x and each test is a 20min long scenario of common usage pattern - Google, Notion, GitHub, YouTube, PiP, wolt, Shopping, reading news, looking for apartments. Each run is same as all others with an almost second precision thanks to the magic of endless patience and screen recording.</p>\n<p>I've spent too much of my life on this, and won't do it again. :P I've written HOW below, so just imagine make your own scenario that suits you, and do your own tests. :)</p>\n<p>If you think my tests are imprecise, or are triggered by not seeing your favourite browser, great, go yell at your browser vendor. They should be doing these tests, not a random bloke on Reddit.</p>\n<h1>Results:</h1>\n<p>Chrome is still the king resource hog on macOS. Edge is even worse but is at least aware of the issue and trying. Safari lives in a magical buggy world of its own. Brave is just Chrome. Orion is kinda startup-y. Arc is hard to work with. Opera trying to please everyone. Firefox is unprofitable but very solid.</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/ut58map3d2ua1.png?width=2688&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=df50bd0ef10db9686a9e9f2bbaf3f159dd8c8427</p>\n<h1>Per test breakdown:</h1>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/b8ugbzhid2ua1.png?width=2034&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=780429972d312ce674edde571400fe9fdfe5c0c9</p>\n<h1>What I used:</h1>\n<p>I ran all the tests on the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>macOS Ventura 13.3.1, on MacBook Pro 14\" M1 Pro with 32GB RAM</strong></li>\n<li>Edge 112.0.1722.39</li>\n<li>Arc 0.98.1</li>\n<li>Brave v1.50.114</li>\n<li>Safari Version 16.4</li>\n<li>Firefox 112.0</li>\n<li>Opera 97.0.4719.63</li>\n<li>Orion v0.99.123.3</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>How I did it:</h1>\n<p>This time I used powermetrics with a per-second measurement interval, which gave me Apple\u2019s approximation fo Combined Power or Package Power how it was called previously. Basically CPU + GPU + ANE but not including brightness, network etc.</p>\n<p>You can use this same bash pipeline to create your own measurements and save em into a file.</p>\n<pre><code>sudo powermetrics \\\n  -i 1000 \\\n  --samplers cpu_power,gpu_power \\\n  -a --hide-cpu-duty-cycle \\\n  --show-usage-summary \\\n  --show-extra-power-info \\\n| grep --line-buffered -E \"Combined Power \\(CPU \\+ GPU \\+ ANE\\): [0-9]*\" \\\n| sed -u -n 's/Combined Power (CPU + GPU + ANE): \\([0-9]*\\) mW/\\1/p' \\\n| while read -r line; do printf \"%s, %s\\n\" $(date +%s) $line; done \\\n&gt; ./recordings/raw/general/brave.csv\n</code></pre>\n<p>You'd probably have to chart em later using something, since its just raw data csv that includes a timestamp and mW measurement on each second, and <a href=\"https://github.com/markomitranic/strom-bench\">I used Elixir's Livebook</a> for the charts above, you can use anything you wish to.</p>\n<p><strong>Just imagine make your own scenario that suits you, and do your own tests. :)</strong></p>\n<p>This time I tried to make the test very balanced. In previous tests, which included a lot more tab switching, and no WebGL and media consumption, Safari was using 10x less than Chrome. While that was funny, I wanted a test that includes those things that Safari is not so good at.</p>\n<p>Additional notes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All tabs remain open. Each time i jump to the next \"test item\" i open a new tab in the same browser. I wanted to see how a browser with 20 open tabs behaves.</li>\n<li>Every time I am finished with a \"test item\" i go back to the Notion tab, to read what is the next test I need to run (also helped a lot with stabilising test results as it forces the browser to keep commonly used tabs in memory, and it gives me clear 10sec breakpoints where I \"cut\" the data)</li>\n<li>Only one browser is tested at a time. I restart the computer each time and charge the battery back to 100%.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Want to read more?</h1>\n<p>You don't have to. This is not an ad for my blogpost. I've copypasta-ed all the info into this post anyway. I've also already written about it in the previous 2 posts on this subreddit. If you still want it, released a <a href=\"https://medium.com/homullus/8-browsers-in-a-tiny-car-energy-efficiency-benchmark-fe3ca82f1690\">blogpost</a> which goes into it, if you are really interested, but thats not the point, all you want to know is in the charts above.</p></div>",

Based on the comments, I've made the test better, and added more popular browsers. People kept yelling how Chrome is now better - and it is clearly not.</p>\n<p>TLDR: It started very simple - I was in love with Arc UI, but noticed high energy usage and wanted to compare it to Safari. I am <strong>not concerned with performance, only energy usage</strong>, if you care about raw performance, this is not a post for you. These tests are not scientific, they reflect my usage on my machine, yours will be different! Here is the built-in app that I used to measure a 15minute average.</p>\n<p><code>sudo powermetrics -i 1000 --poweravg 1 | grep 'Average cumulatively decayed power score' -A 20</code></p>\n<h1>Results:</h1>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Safari</strong>: 140</li>\n<li><strong>Orion</strong>: 184</li>\n<li><strong>Firefox</strong>: 497</li>\n<li><strong>Arc</strong>: 622</li>\n<li><strong>Chrome</strong>: 1213</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Disclaimers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>IE - Disqualified because I don't care.</li>\n<li>SigmaOS - Disqualified because it feels like Vim and Notion had a baby. Sorry, not for me.</li>\n<li>Chrome's score was totally wild, it went up to 2k at one point, but later averaged 1.2k. No other browser had those spikes. I tested twice to ensure that was the case.</li>\n<li>Testing method seems very stabile. The numbers for Safari and Arc closely match my previous tests. So far I've ran tests 5x on those two browsers.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Testing:</h1>\n<p>Each test begins with a freshly powered on Mac with 100% battery and attached to power. All apps and OS are latest versions. Mac always kept at roughly the same temperature. The browsers don't have any extensions (unless they come with built-in ones) and are freshly installed. All window sizes kept the same, covering roughly 80% of the screen. Whenever I open a new tab, i leave the previous one open, thus every list item below has its own tab by the end.</p>\n<p>Script is as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Watch whole <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jrh5idPduJA\">2k HDR 60fps on YouTube</a> (paste url) in full screen mode.</li>\n<li>Watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drLZxyv79Oo\">Dave2d in HD</a> (paste url) in PiP, <strong>while doing all stuff below.</strong></li>\n<li>Search for \"<a href=\"https://drazevacshelter.org/en/\">drazevac shelter</a>\" on Google via address bar. Open the page and slowly scroll to bottom.</li>\n<li>Open <a href=\"https://www.animalwebaction.com/en/collectes/14816/croquettes-sos-300-chiens-serbie-/\">Animal Web Action</a> (paste url), slowly skim through the interview, donate.</li>\n<li>Open a local apartment searching website and find a specific apartment every time. Go through the slideshow, read the page, copy the address.</li>\n<li>Paste the address into google, and click on the Google Maps widget/result. Zoom in and out. Use 3D, use StreetView.</li>\n<li>Open a Pull Request on Github. Read the code for about a minute.</li>\n<li>Open Discord, check my posts about donating to \"<a href=\"https://drazevacshelter.org/en/\">drazevac shelter</a>\" on two spaces.</li>\n<li>Open a <a href=\"https://www.dr.dk\">Danish News</a> website, click on an article, copy URL.</li>\n<li>Open Google Translate, paste the URL and click on the result. This will open a new, translated page. Spend 3 minutes slowly reading the article.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Calculation:</h1>\n<p>The output of powermetrics looks similar to Activity monitor, but lists only the top offenders. It also creates averages in a rolling time window, and I've used the 15minute averages. I've always discarded the system/kernel processes which had very stabile usage anyway. I have added up all the processes that belong to an individual browser, including various workers, video encoders, tab containers etc. Overall, most of the power usage always belonged to the tabs themselves, apart from Chrome, where the App process itself was averaging between 400 and 1000. The shape of data (while writing this) is below.</p>\n<pre><code>**** Average cumulatively decayed power score ****\n\n                                            15 sec           1 min\ncom.apple.WebKit.WebContent            33.3628      27.592\nWindowServer                           14.3019     8.72686\nTerminal                                13.814     11.0305\nSafari                                 5.74578     4.42689\npowermetrics                            5.2907     4.38439\nkernel_task                            2.23776     1.73242\ncom.apple.WebKit.Networking           0.837266    0.872574\nlaunchd                               0.364388    0.250244\n</code></pre>\n<p>&#x200B;</p></div>",

God damn am I going to miss it.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, what we all know is true, was true. It is a huge hog due to Chromium. I've been unable to find any concrete numbers on Chrome vs Safari vs Arc etc, apart from random Redditor's anecdotal evidence.</p>\n<p>For me, it is crucial that the browser is optimised. Thats a bit vague, so let's put it like this - I am sick of years of warm CPUs, loud fans, and 60min battery spans. I don't really care if \"technically\" it might be optimised, i care only about a real world feeling. Thus, after a bit of deliberation I dropped all CPU/RAM/GPU metrics, and decided to go with Apple's own POWER. Unfortunately I don't know how to get \"Energy Impact\" from Activity Monitor into a more readable format, so I used the next closest thing Apple gave us:</p>\n<pre><code>sudo powermetrics -i 1000 --poweravg 1 | grep 'Average cumulatively decayed power score' -A 20\n</code></pre>\n<p>I've replicated four 20min long tests as close as I could. While they may not be scientific, I don't really care, I just wanted to see some stabile numbers. I did these steps as close as I humanly could (i hope someone makes a script to automate this sort of tests lol):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Clean restart, 100% battery, nothing else running</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Watch a 6min long 4K@60 HDR on youtube, in full screen</p>\n</li>\n<li>Put a HD yt video of Hasan making fun of Trumps lawyers in PiP (while doing all other tasks below)</li>\n<li>Find a local restaurant on Google Maps, use StreetView and 3D view, browse photos.</li>\n<li>Find the GitHub Page of Elixir's Porcelain, then browse their docs.</li>\n<li>Use Google Translate to read a major Danish news website in English.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>The results were sad. I grouped up all relevant processes that were impacted by these actions, excluding networking and audio. Safari was fairly stabile on both initial runs (and I even saw zero improvement when using HTML video tags with Baking soda and Vinegar extensions instead of YouTube player, on the third run)</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>Safari</code> without extensions -- 155</li>\n<li><code>Safari</code> without extensions -- 158</li>\n<li><code>Safari</code> with HTML video -- 162</li>\n<li><code>Arc</code> without extensions -- 538</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\ud83d\ude22</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><strong>Update 2h later:</strong></p>\n<p>After some comments elsewhere, I tried to isolate the videos, since they may skew the results by draining way more than normal pages, we expected to see smaller scores. Instead of videos I did a bunch more browsing on Google, Wiki, Maps and news sites. So, way more pages opened and closed. Oh boy were we wrong...</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>Arc</code> - 1149</li>\n<li><code>Safari</code> - 78</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This does seem like the Reddit comments elsewhere are correct in that its not only Chromium, but Arc isn't doing some cleaning that it probably should be doing.</p></div>",

I have been fixing bug day and night to make it stable.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/jygdwiymi3qa1.gif\">Literally, WriteMage works in any app.</a></p>\n<p><strong># Work in any app</strong></p>\n<p>It can grab selected text from any app. You no longer have to copy and paste anymore. WriteMage works in any macOS app, floating on top like Apple Spotlight. Activated by a single keystroke.</p>\n<p>Whether you want to find terminal command, explain Swift code, thinking of google sheets formula, translate to Chinese. It has you covered in any app!</p>\n<p><strong># Privacy + 100% between you and OpenAI + All your chat history is saved locally</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/oalpv0dzi3qa1.gif\">Your own data, We see nothing</a></p>\n<p>I place a high value on your privacy. When this app is running and \"you are <strong>using your own API key</strong>\", it will only connect to the OpenAI server. I have decided not to include telemetry (bug tracker), even in the beta. At app launch, it checks for version updates as well. However, this only happens during app launch and no data is transferred back to my server.</p>\n<p><strong># Custom Prompt + Prompt Library :</strong> You can add your own prompt or download more from our prompt library.</p>\n<p><strong># GPT-4 compatible! :</strong> Use your own API key and choose GPT-4 in the settings to switch the model.</p>\n<p>Right now it's free to use during beta (no paywall, no nagging, <strong>please just give me feedbacks \ud83d\ude02</strong>) but you can support me by buying full license with beta discount (available until the final version is released next month)</p>\n<p>Download link &amp; more info : <a href=\"https://writemage.com\">https://writemage.com</a></p>\n<p>Any suggestion/question is welcome!</p>\n<p>Thanks for macapps sub this is my first mac app post in Reddit!</p>\n<p>If you like it, an upvote is appreciated \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83e\udd79</p></div>",

I have implemented this new API in 5.2.3. I had one person tell me it still wasn't working, so you may need to manually remove Amphetamine from your Login Items in \uf8ff \u2192 System Settings \u2192 General \u2192 Login Items. If you have multiple copies/versions of Amphetamine installed on your Mac, you may need to remove all but the beta, which should be installed in the /Applications folder. If you're running a macOS version prior to Ventura, this doesn't apply to you.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><strong>Closed-Display Mode on Apple Silicon</strong></p>\n<p>With Apple Silicon, the API that Amphetamine used to keep your Mac awake while in closed-display mode stopped working. I opened a bug report/ticket with Apple, but Apple told me tough luck - that's how things are now. Anyways, I've implemented a new mechanism for closed-display mode on Apple Silicon. Unfortunately, starting/ending a closed-display mode session now requires user authentication. If you have Touch ID on your Mac, it's fairly painless to quickly authenticate. Sorry - this is the only way to achieve this on Apple Silicon (that I know of). Intel Macs are not affected.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><strong>Battery Functions on M2</strong></p>\n<p>All of the battery related settings didn't work on M2 Macs. I've fixed this (hopefully).</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><strong>Other</strong></p>\n<p>\u2022 French localization has been added (proof-reading/corrections are likely needed, however). To test French localization, see <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/change-the-system-language-mh26684/mac\">this article</a> from Apple about how to choose the language you use for individual apps.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Preferences/Quick Preferences  (and references to them) have been renamed Settings/Quick Settings for macOS Ventura (and future versions). </p>\n<p>\u2022 If you have an issue where your Mac goes to sleep or your display cuts out immediately upon starting/stopping a session, you can try running the following command in Terminal, after installing the beta. Make sure to relaunch Amphetamine. Would really appreciate hearing back from anyone who can test this. </p>\n<pre><code>defaults write com.if.Amphetamine 'Disable All CDM Functions' -bool YES\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you have feedback, additional bug reports, you may post it here. I'll try to get as many things fixed/updated as possible with this release. Thank you!</p></div>",

It adds mechanical keyboard sounds to every keystroke.</p>\n<p>It's a native app written fully in Swift that focuses on speed, hence there is no lag in the audio feedback from pressing keys like some other apps (in my experience).</p>\n<p>Klack focuses on modern popular keyboard switches rather than for example typewriter sounds. I will continue expanding Klack with additional switches over time, hoping to get a solid set of 20+ switches soon enough. There's a new version in review with additional switches coming out very soon. I've also added randomized pitching to the new release (makes sound way more unique every key press).</p>\n<p>Klack supports up/down keys separately, the result is way more realistic compared to playing both the sounds simultaneously.</p>\n<p>I personally found it vital that the app had a negligible footprint on my system (mainly RAM) for it to be worth running all the time.</p>\n<p>Please feel free to request any features if you feel there's something missing.

            "content_html": "<caption>Open: <a href='https://reddit.com/r/macapps/comments/11wyjz9/we_need_to_talk_about_rewind/'>Reddit</a></caption><div><br></div><div><p>Recently, on the capitalist hustle hellscape that is Product Hunt, I came across a new app called <strong>Rewind</strong>. <a href=\"https://www.rewind.ai/\">Rewind</a>, as described by founder Dan Siroker, is a search engine for your life - it runs in the background, recording everything you do, click on, view, compresses it and OCR's it so you can invoke it at any time and search for what you're looking for. It's a bit like insurance - you'll probably not use it very much, but if you ever need it, you'll be glad that it's there.</p>\n<p>Back when I discovered it, in December of 22, it was in Early Access and could only be accessed over a waitlist. Being the seasoned Mac App Bullshit veteran I am, I entered my email. A few weeks later, I received the early access email - I was in! Quickly I went to the website and looked for the download link.</p>\n<p>Instead of a download link, it presented me with a purchase flow. Rewind costs - or rather, did cost - 20 US dollars a month. </p>\n<p>Now, I'm not stranger to paying for a good app. Far from it, in fact! I paid for the Affinity suite, I paid for iA, I paid for a lot of good apps that improve my workflow. Do I think it's a bit stupid that an app like CleanShot is charging for the privilege of screenshots? Lasso for a feature that's free on Windows, and built in by now? Sure, but developers need to eat too. And an app like Rewind, sure, all that analysis and encryption and compression needs a strong server backend, so I get it. They need to cover the costs.</p>\n<p>But here's the thing - they don't. Rewind, as far as I can tell, is a completely local app. It runs on your machine, doesn't send anything to the cloud, all your data stays on your machine. You can even box it in with a firewall and it does not complain, care, or even notice.</p>\n<p>Which brings me back to the earlier point. Rewind, a completely local app that works absolutely fine in its current state and is a lot more stable than basically any other Early Access app I've tried, charges 20 bucks a month for something that would continue working forever if a meteor took out Rewind HQ tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Or, actually, correct that. Not 20 bucks. It's now changed the pricing - there's a free trial now, great success, and they lowered the price to 10 a month. Only catch: <strong>If you choose the 10 dollar a month tier, they limit how many times you are allowed to open this local app on your own computer.</strong> If you want unlimited, better choke up another 20. Yeah, you read right: <em>Another</em> 20. The Pro plan is 30 dollars now. But hey, at least you get the CEO's phone number. What? That's gotta be up there as the weirdest benefit I've seen on a pricing page.</p>\n<p>I'm not supporting this. I can't. I love the idea, and as someone with memory issues, it's a great feature that I've wanted for years - and were it 30, maybe 50, probably even 100 dollars, I'd've gladly paid it. But this? Subscriptions for local apps that don't need any serverside maintenance, ever, by design? It's an insult to the customer.</p>\n<p>Actually, scratch that. The <em>actual</em> insult to the customer is that, in an email, the founder admitted to me that the high price is \"priced on the value, not on the cost\". Brilliant! What's next, food prices rise based on how good of a meal I could make with the ingredients? Gas prices that get higher if I drive a car that gets better mileage? In a now deleted FAQ, the CEO admitted that it's to \"filter out low-priority tech support requests\". Wow, what a load of arrogant horseshit, if you pardon my French.</p>\n<p>It's a shame to see macOS embracing this more and more. Subscriptions everywhere, hidden fees, In-App purchases. Yes, developers need to eat. Yes, good software should cost money, that's not the issue. The issue is when you push so far you alienate and insult your customers.</p>\n<p>I hope someone else comes along and puts them in competition. Brilliant idea, great execution, absolutely appalling corporate structure.</p></div>",

The whole <a href=\"https://github.com/p0deje/Maccy/releases/tag/0.26.0\">changelog</a> is in GitHub and some of the new features are making it a way more powerful tool that needs a bit more explanation, so I've decided to write this post, though I'm not sure if Reddit is the best place for this.</p>\n<p><strong>Regexp search</strong></p>\n<p>One of the oldest requested features from 2020 (<a href=\"https://github.com/p0deje/Maccy/issues/184\">p0deje/Maccy#184</a>). It's now possible to use regular expressions in the search - it looks like this and uses Swift's regular expression engine.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/08i37ne0e4oa1.png?width=1444&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=67d356e73b0fe544477398f6f9b29b010a97b6ab\">Regexp search</a></p>\n<p><strong>Mixed search</strong></p>\n<p>It's not convenient to go to preferences to change search mode (exact/fuzzy/regexp) so there is now an experimental mixed search that attempts to go from the most to the least exact mode. </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Try to find exact matches using the search term.</li>\n<li>If there are no exact matches, switch to the fuzzy search.</li>\n<li>If there are no fuzzy matches, switch to the regexp search.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This way I can find the best results via the exact search, but also make accidental typos because the fuzzy search kicks in, or just use plain regular expressions as a search term.</p>\n<p><strong>Get Copy from Maccy History in the Shortcuts.app</strong></p>\n<p>One of my favorite features is the ability to use the Shortcuts.app to retrieve items from Maccy history by index or selection. It's possible to get different content from them (rich text, plain text, HTML, images, etc). This allows to do fancy processing of the copied items, here are some examples:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/xego025mf4oa1.png?width=2124&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=21053237c8654cb17cdf5db3760468cb0f34f1a2\">Trim whitespace from the selected item in Maccy and paste by pressing \u2325\u2318.</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/m8whczptf4oa1.png?width=2112&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=dcbd352b70283b5f898bdcc78bd0730720d90901\">Convert the selected RTF item in Maccy to Markdown and paste by pressing \u2325\u2318,</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ghwr4jwbg4oa1.png?width=2030&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=81455b31e013d6431a06a7004ce0a3a3137173b6\">Save the most recent 10 items from Maccy to CSV</a></p>\n<p><strong>Compatibility with Pure Paste</strong></p>\n<p>There is a wonderful <a href=\"https://sindresorhus.com/pure-paste\">Pure Paste</a> application by u/sindresorhus that strips formatting from copied content.

This emulates Windows functionality on a Mac.  I realize this has been discussed in the past and that Command+Q will close an app.  Not trying to get into the debate about whether or not this functionality is better or worse than the default Mac behavior of leaving *most applications open even if they have no windows. The reasoning for this app is purely personal preference.  I like having only the applications I'm currently working in open and also prefer an uncluttered application switcher.  There have been a number of challenges in getting this application to work correctly and some users have reported an issue with some applications quitting immediately upon opening.  What I'm looking for are some users to test the new version 1.5 and report on whether or not they experience any of the same type of issue.  If you are interested in this type of functionality and want to help test you can download Swift Quit at <a href=\"https://swiftquit.com\">https://swiftquit.com</a>.

Although the initial plan was to make it public in a week but thanks to a ProductHunt bug I went live today \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc If you want, you can check the page <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/posts/lasso-6\">here</a> I would appreciate your support.</p>\n<p>Here is a little demo of the app:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/8wr9804q2uca1.gif\">Basic interactions with the app</a></p>\n<p>What problem am I trying to solve? Personally, I had issues remembering complex shortcuts, and even though I was a huge fan of the Rectangle app I could not use its full potential. Things got worse when I bought a new 38\" monitor and I realized that halves and thirds are not enough for me anymore. (just in case you are curious about my setup you can check it here on <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/macsetups/comments/103ddsf/my_home_office/\">Reddit</a>). Also, I wanted to move windows between displays and when you have a couple of monitors, one of them is pretty big, this might be quite a lot of mouse movements.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>So these were my personal problems that I tried to solve by implementing the <a href=\"https://thelasso.app\">Lasso</a> app.</p>\n<p>With the app you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>quickly resize and move windows by selecting grid cells. I believe that click and drag is the most intuitive and fast gesture in macOS.</li>\n<li>move windows between displays</li>\n<li>create, share, import, and export your own layouts</li>\n<li>assign keyboard shortcuts to those layouts for even faster interaction with the app</li>\n<li>customize the UI of the app</li>\n<li>for those coming from the Rectangle or Magnet I made it easy to migrate - just don't keep the onboarding screen \ud83d\ude04</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The app has free 7 days trial period so I'd like to ask everyone to try it out. The single license code is 9.99 Euros and can be activated on a single computer. Let me know if you like it - this would make my launch day a bit better since a lot of things went wrong today. If you don't like it - I would be happy to know why so that I can make it better.</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p></div>",

I've found that each one brings its own unique benefits that other launchers just can't replace.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/eclv0drogfca1.png?width=1932&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=7985ae64ae5d17cce9a5b4ab21c9eb4317659790\">Alfred, Keyboard Maestro, Raycast &amp; Google drive</a></p>\n<p>In this post, I'll be diving into the specific features and use cases of each launcher, and how they've helped me boost my productivity.</p>\n<h1>Alfred (with Powerpack)</h1>\n<p>Alfred is a powerful launcher that I've found to be extremely useful in my daily workflow. One of its main strengths is its ability to launch anything from your mac quickly and efficiently. While Raycast is also great for this, Alfred offers additional functionality that I find to be extremely helpful.</p>\n<p>One of these is to search for your web bookmarks. By creating bookmarks to specific pages of the services that I use regularly, I can easily access them with a simple keyboard shortcut (for example, I have created 3 different bookmarks for my CRM - customers / invoice / quotes - and I can access to each page individually without having to go to the homepage of my CRM and navigate via the menu).</p>\n<p><em>Raycast is also good for bookmarks, but you have to go in a submenu, which is an extra step. (you can define a specific Keyboard shortcut, but with 4 different launchers, I don\u2019t need a fifth one!)</em></p>\n<p>Alfred also allows me to create custom workflows (<a href=\"https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/\">learn more</a>). This feature allows me to automate repetitive tasks and streamline my workflow.</p>\n<p>Another great feature of Alfred is the \"Universal Actions\" functionality (<a href=\"https://www.alfredapp.com/universal-actions/\">learn more</a>). This allows me to select text or files and apply a pre-defined workflow to them. For example, I have some specific search and replace actions that I can apply to a text this way, or I can select a name and launch a LinkedIn search for example thanks to Universal Actions.</p>\n<p>Alfred also has a built-in clipboard manager (<a href=\"https://www.alfredapp.com/help/features/clipboard/\">learn more</a>), which is a great. It allows me to keep track of multiple items that I've copied and pasted, making it easy to access them again later. (<a href=\"https://www.raycast.com/extensions/clipboard-history\">Raycast has this too</a>)</p>\n<p>Finally, Alfred also has a snippet expander feature (<a href=\"https://www.alfredapp.com/help/features/snippets/\">learn more</a>) which is great for storing and reusing frequently used phrases or pieces of text. This saves me a lot of time and makes it easy to insert commonly used information into documents or emails. (<a href=\"https://www.raycast.com/extensions/snippets\">Raycast has it too</a>)</p>\n<p>My Keyboard shortcut : \u2318 + Space bar</p>\n<p>Universal Actions shortcut : \u2325 + Space bar</p>\n<h1>Raycast</h1>\n<p>Raycast is another powerful launcher that I've found to be extremely useful in my daily workflow. One of its main strengths is its ability to communicate with external apps, which makes it an incredibly powerful tool for interacting with other software. The UI is also incredibly well-designed, making it easy to use and navigate.</p>\n<p>One of the ways I use Raycast is for searching for emojis and Unicode symbols. It makes it incredibly easy to find the symbol or emoji I need, and insert it into my text. I also use it to search for information within third-party services like Authy or Notion.</p>\n<p>The built-in calculator is also great, you can do currency calculation or anything you can really think about.</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/wwqimlhwhfca1.png?width=1932&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=40774f4903816eacd2573f1e73ca59dcdebe87b1</p>\n<p>Pro-tip : use it to have your next calendar appointment in your Mac Menu bar, this is really helpful!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/tgx8442llfca1.png?width=1344&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=7deae3f3970da62bd37709c822daa15281b279be\">Show Events in Menu Bar</a></p>\n<p>The only downside is that for most searches, you have to go into a submenu, instead of just typing anything and getting the result you need. But this is a small drawback compared to the power and convenience that Raycast offers in terms of external app communication.</p>\n<p>My Keyboard shortcut : \\^ + \u2325 + Space bar</p>\n<h1>Keyboard Maestro</h1>\n<p>Keyboard Maestro is another powerful tool that I've found to be extremely useful in my daily workflow. Its main strength is its ability to automate tasks that need to be done via UI, and it can use OCR and image recognition to create tasks, which makes it incredibly powerful.</p>\n<p>It took me a lot of time to find the right use cases for Keyboard Maestro, and again a lot of time to correctly create the workflows, but once I did, it has saved me hours every week.</p>\n<p>I use Keyboard Maestro to automate repetitive tasks, like accounting and invoicing customers. It's incredibly powerful for anything that requires you to use your mouse. With its OCR and <a href=\"https://wiki.keyboardmaestro.com/action/Find_Image_on_Screen\">image recognition</a> capabilities, it can automate tasks that involve reading or interpreting what\u2019s on my screen.</p>\n<p>Most people don\u2019t use the launcher included with Keyboard Maestro, but as soon as you learn to use it, you can find new use cases for it all the time. It's a great tool for automating repetitive tasks and saving time on your daily workflow.</p>\n<p>My Keyboard shortcut :  \u2325 + \u2318 + Space bar<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhho2Bhzh5w\">Here is a video that show how to set the KM Macro launcher</a></p>\n<h1>Google Drive launcher</h1>\n<p>I've used the Alfred Workflow and the Raycast extension for accessing Google Drive documents before, but I've found that the official Google Drive launcher is more stable and convenient for my needs.</p>\n<p>One of the main strengths of the Google Drive launcher is its ability to easily find Google Drive documents. It integrates seamlessly with the Google Drive platform and makes it easy to access and search for the files I need.</p>\n<p>The downside is that it can be slow at times and it doesn't have as many filtering options as the Google Drive website. But overall, it's a great tool for anyone who heavily uses Google Drive and needs quick access to their documents.</p>\n<p>My Keyboard shortcut :  \u2325 + \u2318 + g</p></div>",
