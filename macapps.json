Love that I can share the list with her even though she's not a premium user)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://Sync.com\">Sync.com</a> app. End-to-end encrypted Cloud app and has been flawless for me, far more reliable than any other Cloud-based app and uses icon overlays to confirm files are saved. It also allows for storing files locally.</li>\n<li>Fantastical. Been using for years and it seems every few months I discover new functions. Currently using different calendar sets for various accounts, so my calendar isn't always a cluttered mess.</li>\n<li>WeatherBug. It lives in my menubar and constantly shows the temp and any precipitation wherever I'm at. Simple but reliable.</li>\n<li>Irvue. It gives me a different awesome desktop image every hour, although you can set it to change as often as you want.</li>\n<li>WhatsApp, Messenger, Signal, Telegram, etc. for desktop. I never have to reach for my phone anymore to check/respond to a message.</li>\n<li>Pulse SMS. It is basically iMessage for Android. Allows me to text from my Android number on my Mac. Beautiful UI, works flawlessly.</li>\n<li>Brave browser. Yeah, it's a browser, but has no ads, unless you turn them on, built on Chromium without the battery drain, and much much faster, almost as fast as Safari, but indistinguishably slower. Also, they pay me in crypto to use the browser. Made about $150 the last 2 years. Kinda cool.</li>\n<li>TopNotch. Hides the menubar notch. I think BTT does this too, but TopNotch is simple and clean.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I use a lot of Apple stock apps too, but I love the ones above.</p>\n<p>EDIT: Can't stop at 10. I also love Airmail and 1Password. Spark is a cool email client too, but I mostly love Airmail for it's customizations.</p></div>",

Now Mac Mouse Fix 2 is finally here! It's 100% free and open source. It's unobtrusive and light weight. And it's super easy to use while still giving you tons power for your workflow. If you use a third party mouse I think you'll love it!</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://mousefix.org\">Download</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix\">GitHub</a></p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Here's the full changelog:</p>\n<h2>Mouse Gestures done right.</h2>\n<p><strong>Click</strong> a Mouse Button <strong>and Drag</strong> in different directions to enter <strong>Mission Control</strong>, <strong>move between Spaces</strong>, or see <strong>all windows of the current app</strong> - all using just a single Button!</p>\n<p>Mac Mouse Fix Gestures feel much more <strong>fluid and responsive</strong> than any other driver on the market. This is possible because Mac Mouse Fix can precisely emulate the output of Apple's Trackpad driver.</p>\n<p>https://reddit.com/link/s5h7gb/video/x7du5jij93c81/player</p>\n<h2>With great power comes great ... ease of use!</h2>\n<p>With the new <strong>Action Table</strong>, you can set up your Mouse exactly how you want it - in seconds.</p>\n<p>Move the pointer into the \"+\" field, then simply show Mac Mouse Fix the clicks and drags that you want to assign a new Action to.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://reddit.com/link/s5h7gb/video/8s1e0ntk93c81/player\">Adding an Action for Double-Clicking the Middle Mouse Button is super simple.</a></p>\n<h2>A major boost to your productivity.</h2>\n<p>Mouse Gestures, together with the new Action Table allow you to get <strong>7x more functionality out of a single Button</strong> compared to conventional mouse drivers. All while being so simple and intuitive that you'll actually use all those features.</p>\n<p>This way anyone can leverage the convenient navigation options that make macOS so powerful - from any mouse. Even the simplest ones.</p>\n<p>For example, with the default configuration, you can use all these Actions using <strong>just the Middle Mouse Button</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mission Control</li>\n<li>Move Left a Space</li>\n<li>Move Right a Space</li>\n<li>App Expos\u00e9</li>\n<li>Show Desktop</li>\n<li>Launchpad</li>\n<li>Look Up</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And this is right out of the box. Without even tapping into the endless, yet easy-to-use customization options.</p>\n<h1>Other Features</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Go <strong>Back and Forward</strong> in Safari and other apps just like on Windows.</li>\n<li><strong>Zoom in and out</strong> by holding Command (\u2318) while scrolling. Works just like pinch-to-zoom on a trackpad.</li>\n<li>Experience a refined, friction based <strong>smooth scrolling</strong> algorithm, that strikes a great balance between fluidity and control. And also change the <strong>scrolling direction</strong> of your mouse independently from your trackpad.</li>\n<li>Use <strong>Keyboard Shortcuts</strong> right from your mouse to get even more flexibility for your workflow.</li>\n<li>You can remap to <strong>any key on your keyboard</strong>. Even function keys that are only found on Apple keyboards like 'Play-Pause', 'Increase Display Brightness', etc.</li>\n<li>And more!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>Mac Mouse Fix started out as a little hobby project to teach myself programming. But due to your support and encouragement, my goal is now to create the <strong>Best Mouse Driver Ever</strong>. With Mac Mouse Fix 2 we came quite a bit closer to that goal. Thank you! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 :)</p></div>",

I know there's a few awesome users that jumped on board from this very subreddit!</p>\n<p>OwlOCR 5 addresses a need that has been raised by its power-users multiple times over the last two years - the possibility to script OwlOCR and integrate it to different workflows! For this purpose a command line interface is provided, so it should be very accommodating to different tools. During OwlOCR 5 beta test period and after that users have already integrated it to their Alfred and Hazel workflows and I\u2019m really excited to see where all it\u2019s going to go in the future.</p>\n<p>In addition OwlOCR 5 carries all the previous iterations features like opening QR coded URLs easily, capturing any text of the screen, converting images or scans to searchable PDFs and more.</p>\n<p>OwlOCR 5 is a free upgrade to all current customers as all previous iterations have been as well. The app has a generous free tier, an automatic 3 week trial of the Premium tier and to celebrate launch the lifetime license will be -30% until 12th January!</p>\n<p>It is also launching on Product Hunt right now, so if you're a Product Hunt users, will be happy to get some love on that forum as well!</p>\n<p>Product Hunt: <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/posts/owlocr-5\">https://www.producthunt.com/posts/owlocr-5</a></p>\n<p>Homepage: <a href=\"https://owlocr.com/\">https://owlocr.com</a></p>\n<p>Mac App Store: <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/owlocr-screenshot-to-text/id1499181666\">https://apps.apple.com/us/app/owlocr-screenshot-to-text/id1499181666</a></p></div>",

It's the ability to search your images directly for texts within them.<br />\nThe app is called <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/qfindify/id1598790473?mt=12\">QFindify</a>, it's available on the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/qfindify/id1598790473?mt=12\">AppStore</a>, and it's a menubar app where you can drag/drop or import images and perform searches for words to narrow down to the images that contains those words.</p>\n<p>This is personally very useful if you have a lot of screenshots or folder full of images but you don't really have a way to quickly identify the images that have specific words,  for example \"lecture Biology Sociology wednesday\".<br />\nWhat makes QFindify different from similar apps is that all processing is done locally on your Mac rather than connecting to external online servers, thus all your data stay where they belong, on your mac.<br />\nThere's an image preview panel allowing to view the images as you scroll through your search results and at any moment, open the image directly. You can toggle to keep the app afloat so your can directly drag and drop batches of images or import from a panel.</p>\n<p>The app is free to download and completely free to use all the features I've mentioned above.<br />\nBut there is a one time IAP of 1.99 if you need additional enhancements and a bit more advanced capability.<br />\nSome Advanced Mode features are:<br />\n- advanced filtering options of: ANY/ALL/NONE/EXACT and Regex/pattern matching<br />\n- Save all the images meeting your search into a single unified PDF and open it<br />\n- Create and save all the images matching your search into a New Folder<br />\n- Completely detach the app from the Menubar and float above all other apps<br />\n- Other options to fine tune performance: adjust recognition level, language correction, optimize for specific language, limit to perform to CPU/GPU, etc.</p>\n<p>There is an update coming within next few days of: Near instantaneous live search results without you having to press enter key and some animation stabilities.<br />\nThis is my first app ever after jumping into programming back in 2018, so I would love to hear any feedbacks you guys have and especially let me know if you notice any bugs/glitches you want me to fix up on.</p></div>",

I don't care about Kindle or Kobo Bookstore functionality. I want to be able to read my books that I have on my iPad and annotate them (underline, make notes on the margins, etc) and then have that somehow sync to OneNote. Is there a solution for this? I'm not sure if a dedicated app like PDF Expert is the way to go, or some other cloud app solution?  Other apps I've looked into in this space are Highlighter, Flexcil, Marginnotes, Liquidtext. (Will these allow annotations in both PDFs and EPUBs? Or only PDFs? There's too many apps in this space but not sure if they will do what I'm looking for which is to be able to take my thoughts from the books I'm reading and then bringing them into a knowledge database (which for now is in OneNote). </li>\n<li>I also read alot of articles on the web (like on Medium, Reddit posts, Quora, etc) and want to capture other people's great insights and thoughts into my OneNote system. I've read good things about ReadWise, but a few problems are that its not free, and it doesnt have integration with OneNote. Are there other tools out there that can allow you to pull your insights from articles and enable you to import them into OneNote?</li>\n<li>Related to the knowledge management system itself, my current knowledge management system is within OneNote. OneNote doesnt have bidirectional link capability like RoamResearch or Obsidian, nor is it as flashy as Notion is, but its free, cross platform, allows multiple people to use at the same time, and syncs really well across my devices so it sort of works for now until I can find a better alternative. Apps like Roam are either pricy, or in beta like Obsidian (which means they likely will have costs in the future). I would much rather either go self-hosted for free, or find an alternative to OneNote. I have read that Microsoft Loop may be a Notion alternative and may integrate with OneNote natively. Has anyone had a beta test of Microsoft Loop and if so, how does it function? Also I'm aware it may not be free, but if it is free as part of the Office 365 package it may be an appealing prospect.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you have ideas on my workflow above and think there are ways to do it better <strong>please, please</strong> let me know. <strong>I've spent months</strong> looking for something that will work effectively. And I've been sort of lost, there's so many apps and services out there, different fragmented ecosystems, little interoperability between systems, its a mess.  I know there is paid solutions like Readwise and Notion that can do some of this, but hoping there is really good alternatives. </p>\n<p>I also fear being \"locked in\" to any kind of ecosystem with proprietary databases. So far with OneNote I know my data is text format, so although it would be a pain to copy the text from every OneNote tab I have, atleast I know I can do it. </p>\n<p>Thank you so much for your help reading this and for your time. Eternally grateful for your advice,</p></div>",

I recently made a very big change to the UI to give you more flexibility in reviewing your cards.</p>\n<p>I got a lot of feedback that people wanted to review outside of the regular spaced repetition schedule. This new version updates the UI so you get a WYSIWYG playlist for card review. The playlist is sorted based on your review history and current review mode. You can sort by due date, scheduled by spaced repetition; by last review, for cram-style review; or even by difficulty.</p>\n<p>The app syncs with iCloud and can be used on iOS as well. One-time purchase, no subscriptions!</p>\n<p>More details here as well: <a href=\"https://www.ussherpress.com/freshcards/\">https://www.ussherpress.com/freshcards/</a></p></div>",

All links are at <a href=\"https://loshadki.app/openin/\">OpenIn</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Quick note, if you have never heard about OpenIn before. It handles files and links on your mac, and redirect them to the preferred application based on rules, or shows you app selection dialog so you can choose which browser you want to use or app for a file. You can open mailto links in Google Mail in the browser, you can open notion links in the Notion app, you can open zoom meetings in the zoom app without going to the browser. You can remove tracking query params like <code>utm_</code> and <code>uta_</code> from links. You can open xcodeproj in Sublime by telling it to open the folder instead of the file. And there is a lot more!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Please read the announcement <a href=\"https://loshadki.app/blog/2021-12-01-openin-v3/\">OpenIn - Version 3</a>, I have included also a section \"How Author of OpenIn uses OpenIn\" so you can see a small example how OpenIn can be configured to make you more productive on your mac!</p>\n<p>There are a LOT of new features!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>New redesigned interface for rules</li>\n<li>Auto-resolve shortened URLs</li>\n<li>Backup and restore</li>\n<li>Writing custom scripts with JavaScript </li>\n<li>Share Extension</li>\n<li>And more!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As a celebration for publishing v3, I am running a promotion on App Store, 40% off ($5.99 instead of $9.99). </p>\n<p>This is a free upgrade for v1/v2 users. More than that, if you did not have Pro features before, now you have them. I have removed In-App-Purchases, seems it confused a lot of people.</p>\n<p>Note about macOS Catalina, I dropped support for Catalina in v3, but you can now download v2 for macOS Catalina from our website for free! v3 only works on Big Sur and Monterey. </p>\n<p>Btw, just a history about OpenIn:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In the beginning I made OpenIn free, and only charged for Pro features. But I got a lot of fake reviews. Probably targeted by some scam applications like \"Open In Pro\" (this app is a free download with a lot of 5 starts reviews, and requires you to purchase In-App-Purchase to use it, and as I understand it only allows you to change default browser). To protect reviews of OpenIn - I have changed it to be a paid app and kept Pro features as In-App-Purchase. </li>\n<li>OpenIn v2 was for a while 4.99 for the app, and 4.99 for Pro features. But for some reason, some users just don't like In-App-Purchases. Got a lot of emails about that.</li>\n<li>OpenIn v3 is 9.99 for everything, no In-App-Purchases are required. Which means if you downloaded v1 a while ago, it is free and you got v3 for free with all the features. If you purchased v2 without Pro features, now you got them.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And if you read till that point. 10 Promo Codes (if you take one, please post in the comment which one you took). I will post more codes (up to 50 in total) later if this post will get more votes.  </p>\n<ul>\n<li>~~LH9W3HKRRK7J~~</li>\n<li>~~XYP67RH3ME9F~~</li>\n<li>WHMYHRMWATPY</li>\n<li>~~KXKKYK6TWALL~~</li>\n<li>~~H6A6ELEFARTY~~</li>\n<li>~~6EM7HLPT3ARF~~</li>\n<li>~~XFWTLLX6HYK3~~</li>\n<li>~~KR3MYWTPLM36~~</li>\n<li>~~MXJK69X4K773~~</li>\n<li>~~KY96JXMEL93R~~</li>\n</ul></div>",

The frustration is that there are so many apps out there, and many of them are garbage. Like buying a mattress, it seems like every review out there is incomplete or paid for by one of them. So I decided to install all the serious PDF readers/editors I could find and spend half the day looking for the best option. Hope this helps someone, as I've seen plenty of posts looking in the past. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pCt75tHayO_QJO2swREcZEgAFEhrm9-3pnDogh5kpRM\">PDF Reader Comparison Spreadsheet</a></p>\n<p>I don't claim perfection, so if I missed something, please let me know and I'll correct it.

I am indie developer, just cannot have ability to test and support 2 versions behind. Also it is getting pretty hard to get access to older versions of macOS with M1.</p>\n<p>But I am not going to leave macOS Catalina users, for them I have provided a free version that is available from our <a href=\"https://loshadki.app/openin/#is-openin-available-on-macos-catalina-1015x\">website</a>. It is the last currently available version of OpenIn on app store (with just one fix for numeric keyboard).</p>\n<p>I am going to open a beta testing for OpenIn vNext soon, if you are interested, please subscribe to our newsletter (at the bottom of the page https://loshadki.app). I do not share emails with anybody, and send only announcements (probably sent 2-3 emails this year). One important detail about beta testing, it is going to be available via TestFlight for macOS, so you have to be on Monterey to participate. </p>\n<p>And the last thing, app is for $1.99 (instead of $4.99), Pro features are 2.99 (instead of $4.99) until November 30 (early Black Friday, Cyber Monday deal).</p>\n<p>Enjoy! Feedback and suggestions are always welcome! Work has started!</p></div>",
