The frustration is that there are so many apps out there, and many of them are garbage. Like buying a mattress, it seems like every review out there is incomplete or paid for by one of them. So I decided to install all the serious PDF readers/editors I could find and spend half the day looking for the best option. Hope this helps someone, as I've seen plenty of posts looking in the past. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pCt75tHayO_QJO2swREcZEgAFEhrm9-3pnDogh5kpRM\">PDF Reader Comparison Spreadsheet</a></p>\n<p>I don't claim perfection, so if I missed something, please let me know and I'll correct it.

I am indie developer, just cannot have ability to test and support 2 versions behind. Also it is getting pretty hard to get access to older versions of macOS with M1.</p>\n<p>But I am not going to leave macOS Catalina users, for them I have provided a free version that is available from our <a href=\"https://loshadki.app/openin/#is-openin-available-on-macos-catalina-1015x\">website</a>. It is the last currently available version of OpenIn on app store (with just one fix for numeric keyboard).</p>\n<p>I am going to open a beta testing for OpenIn vNext soon, if you are interested, please subscribe to our newsletter (at the bottom of the page https://loshadki.app). I do not share emails with anybody, and send only announcements (probably sent 2-3 emails this year). One important detail about beta testing, it is going to be available via TestFlight for macOS, so you have to be on Monterey to participate. </p>\n<p>And the last thing, app is for $1.99 (instead of $4.99), Pro features are 2.99 (instead of $4.99) until November 30 (early Black Friday, Cyber Monday deal).</p>\n<p>Enjoy! Feedback and suggestions are always welcome! Work has started!</p></div>",

Just follow the very simple on-screen indications to very easily start the bootable macOS installer creation process.</p>\n<p>- Fully open: You can see how this programs works and you can freely contribute to it! (<a href=\"https://github.com/ITzTravelInTime/TINU\">https://github.com/ITzTravelInTime/TINU</a>)</p>\n<p>- Support for multiple languages (currently just italian and english, but more will be added with future updates)</p>\n<p>- Can work with every macOS installer app that has the `createinstallmedia` executable inside its internal resources folder (including also beta and newly released installers).</p>\n<p>- 100% clean using the official apple's method: The bootable macOS installers created with this tool are made using the official apple's `createinstallmedia` method, just as if you created them using the command line, this ensures the best and the cleanest results avoiding all the problems that modded installers have.</p>\n<p>- Does not require any special preparations. Just open the program, make sure you have a big enought USB drive plugged in (see the `Requirements` section) and have a macOS installer app on your disk.</p>\n<p>- No need to use Disk Utility first. TINU can format your drive or partition for you, if it's necessary.</p>\n<p>- Integrated downloads from Apple for lots of macOS/OS X installer apps (to access them open the app, go to the menu bar, and then `Tools-&gt;Download a macOS installer`).</p>\n<p>- Integrated EFI partition mounter tool for advanced users.</p>\n<p>- Tested to work on all the latest macOS releases.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Requirements:</p>\n<p>- A computer that runs Mac OS X Yosemite or a more recent version.</p>\n<p>- A drive or a free partition of least 8 GB (9+ for Catalina, 12+ for Big Sur and newer versions) that you want to turn into a macOS/Mac OS X installer (NOTE: partitions are usable only if they belong to a drive which uses the GUID partition format).</p>\n<p>- A copy of a macOS/Mac OS X installer app (only Maveriks or newer versions are supported), it's reccommended to have the app placed into the /Applications folder or in the root of a volume connected to your computer (excepted the drive/volume you want to turn into your macOS install media).</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Download:</p>\n<p>- You can download the app here from the official github releses page: <a href=\"https://github.com/ITzTravelInTime/TINU/releases\">https://github.com/ITzTravelInTime/TINU/releases</a></p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Check out the source code on github:</p>\n<p>- <a href=\"https://github.com/ITzTravelInTime/TINU\">https://github.com/ITzTravelInTime/TINU</a></p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Screenshots:</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/p5by4a8iuyv71.png?width=1464&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=18de6ef992080d68e883ccc232dfa843163eabd4\">Main menu</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/l5gvic8iuyv71.png?width=1464&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f02175a2d830a6c3ccfa28d1c7cf238048123de0\">Requirements screen</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ckj29g8iuyv71.png?width=1464&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87128e98b27a6e0647df6c825cd60d4c980843e8\">Drive select screen</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/yuxs0s8iuyv71.png?width=1464&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb70d7b4a3ddab76d53869c103f6cd287bd97a8f\">Installer app select screen</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/gbwz4s8iuyv71.png?width=1464&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=65f866925cb33acde23ac286fcd8aa5cf48f57e1\">Confirmation screen</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/mhgwos8iuyv71.png?width=1464&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1de4bc6b8f77b23cf699d5bf5368e757af48e04\">Drive creation screen</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/hq7bwe8iuyv71.png?width=256&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=82ad21cd32f8de3fb8512a5b2df354f6a0a7494a\">TINU's icon</a></p>\n<p>NOTE: The icons in the screenshots will be used only if you are running macOS Big Sur and newer versions, for older OSes some alternative system icons will be used.</p></div>",

I know this kicked off a hunt for 1Password alternatives at the time, but to date, my company has yet to find a suitable alternative for storing passwords, software licenses and secure notes in a post-1Password7 world.</p>\n<p>With both a new release of 1Password <em>and</em> a new version of MacOS looming, we're starting to feel the pressure, as we have <em>years</em> of information stored in locally secured and synched vaults that simply <em>cannot</em> be uploaded to Agilebits' cloud service for future use. For now, we're continuing to use 1Password 7 as always, but eventually (maybe not soon, but inevitably some day), <em>something</em> will change in the MacOS security model or other software SDKs that will render 1P7 incompatible with new software. We can't wait for the \"This application cannot be opened...\" dialog to appear, so we're trying to get ahead of this now.</p>\n<p>Basically, we need to ensure that we can continue to do the following, as once 1Password moves on to Version 8, it will no longer meet <em>all</em> these criteria for us:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Store secure notes, credit cards, software licenses, site logins and passwords. (This eliminates using <em>Apple Keychain</em> alone)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Use locally stored files or self-hosted services within an organizations' own network and behind a firewall. (This eliminates cloud-only services such as <em>Dashlane</em> and, tragically, <em>1Password 8+</em>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Use, synch and share <em>multiple</em> vaults among different users. (This eliminates newcomers <em>Simple</em>, <em>Minimal</em> and a few other Mac-only password managers I've looked at to date)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Usable by both technically-minded <em>and</em> non-tech-savvy users (which seems to be a big stumbling block for the many <em>KeepPass</em>-based solutions I've tried so far)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It's a tough request, but these are all things that 1Password has handled well for us for the past decade, but has decided not to continue doing, so... desperate times, I guess.</p>\n<p>That said... Anybody found anything that checks all these boxes yet? Thanks!</p></div>",

I also liked Dropover\u2019s shake cursor feature but it appears like Yoink doesn\u2019t have that. (Could it be replicated using BetterTouchTool maybe?)</p>\n<p>So which is better in your opinion for dragging files, pictures into a temporary shelf? I know ultimately it\u2019s \u201cwhat works best for you\u201d but I\u2019m curious to see what people are using.</p>\n<p>Only seeking opinions for these two apps, no \u201cdon\u2019t see the point of these apps\u201d types posts please.</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance!</p></div>",

I'm still in the decision phase myself - I just get FOMO from seeing the amazing features that are coming out every month from across the board, but we are approaching the note-app singularity. I wrote this list because some of these may completely suit your use case right now.</em></p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><strong>Remember, the key functions of your external brain are:</strong></p>\n<p>- Capture, storage &amp; frictionless retrieval</p>\n<p>- Structured thought</p>\n<p>- Note-taking/writing</p>\n<p>- Freeflow thinking &amp; idea sex</p>\n<p>- Publishing</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><strong>To achieve this, the key features are:</strong></p>\n<p>- Quick capture</p>\n<p>- Omni-bar search</p>\n<p>- Backlinking</p>\n<p>- Tags</p>\n<p>- Own your notes</p>\n<p>- Networked thought</p>\n<p>- Mindmapping</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>These apps nail the above.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Roam Research -</strong> great for academics and non-linear thinkers.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There is a learning curve, but once your ideas start flirting with each other they will start having great sex. Now has a mac app.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/2qv2wonmdls71.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca0c5a9756133da0e4450d0be967bd4f848d1ae9\">Roam Research</a></p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><strong>2) Craft docs:</strong> Offline-first app with a visual focus, clean formatting. It's what Notion should have grown up to be, if it didn't fall in with the naughty cloud-based boys from the other street.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/peaxwb0pdls71.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=300ca9a96b05ab5b778b8829e33cc80560f5711d</p>\n<p><strong>3) Obsidian:</strong> HIGHLY extensible, markdown-based with graphical backlinking and mac-based. Free in beta.  Has a learning curve but super powerful.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/wue0berkels71.jpg?width=2656&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=48ded193d68b937cdc3f1c27db3f037928990e51</p>\n<p><strong>4) Apple notes.</strong> Seriously. Give it another try.  MacOS monterey introduced collaboration, tags, quick-note. While it lacks backlinking and mindmapping, there's nothing faster.   <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5zsJKa8x4I\">here's</a> why I moved from evernote to apple notes.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/avweppdpels71.jpg?width=2742&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f36f5417cb89ea8a0b870b290e6db3bb8011752d</p>\n<p><strong>5) Mindnode</strong>: I've tried every mindmapping software out there. They're all bloated and ugly. Mindnode is totally frictionless and a pleasure to use.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/7kh9k2cxels71.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe5a04eacd73b343a1d08932772a466b1193ea65</p>\n<p>Being able to spacially compress data is like having prosthesis for your memory. No other note taking app comes close for this.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>6) <a href=\"https://Nota.md\">Nota.md</a> </p>\n<p>Beautiful, minimal, markdown-based editor with backlinks. </p>\n<p>WYSIWYG editor, command bar, blazing fast, and you own all your data.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/d8nv5te5fls71.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da4fd1de216e59d6fea059b55fbae47521de1ac4</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><strong>7) Day one:</strong> </p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/81hh9qlcfls71.png?width=1154&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8c4570734c38a7c17134649cbbea5af4ca39241f</p>\n<p>8) <a href=\"https://Reflect.app\">Reflect.app</a> if Obsidian and Apple Notes had a baby. Using it feels like you've cleared your mental cache - simple but powerful interface for note taking with backlinks, daily notes and graph view.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/yo300nvffls71.png?width=1199&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a99ad5e93d43ab978cbd1798d8774731cabb4a79</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><strong>9) Innos Note:</strong> one that I'm extremely excited about: owned by a project with a powerful mindmapping engine, this could be my personal holy grail for the way I think. I'm watching them closely.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/pnt8of3ifls71.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d2cf4c6bf8dd06839a515dcefc324268e0f0c90a</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><strong>10) Meta:</strong> A fresh take on spacial compression: creating a visual housing for your notes on an infinite-canvas</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/wlzq2c3jfls71.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e3620970db51189229541dbb65240ed6d2ba4ad</p>\n<p>I've only scratched the surface here, there's at least 20 more that deserve honourable mentions.   The singularity is coming fellas. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2gVlQb6caE\">Here's</a> my exact workflow to use these systems for maximum productivity.</p>\n<p>For me, minimising friction is the big driver.  It doesn't matter how sophisticated your system is. If it's not smooth for you to use, it's almost useless.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/5sutbj1qfls71.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b682f7b90cdb55ee0b501abeb7126b3841975ad</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><strong>A note on paid vs free software:</strong> There seems to be a culture on reddit that nobody ever wants to pay for software. I get it - it's code on a screen and has no physical deliverables etc. But this is your <strong>external brain</strong> you're paying for. It's at least worth a few quid per month. You get what you pay for. My life got better when I stopped trying to jimmy everything on the cheap with exclusively opensource/freeware. Saying that, most of the above have free versions.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Happy to answer any questions below.</p></div>",

It autocompletes anything you want, including common websites, entire boilerplate multiple paragraph responses, addresses, hard-to-spell words, anything that you need to type out many times a month and want to instead create a simple shortcut for it. </p>\n<p>I have a simple mnemonic that I use: I come up some short name (generally 2-6 letters) that remind me of the text it represents (<em>add</em> for my 4-line address, <em>thank</em> for a 6-paragraph \"thank you for purchasing\" email, etc), and then I follow each shortcut with a double xx (mainly because it's easy for me to reach it on the keyboard). For example, there's a page to my bank that has a massively long URL, so I created a shortcut named <em>bankxx</em> and as soon as I hit the spacebar, the entire 60-character website gets typed out. </p>\n<p>The developer regularly puts out updates, and never a upcharge, even years later.</p>\n<p>I've no connection to the dev, just passing on an app that is one of those joys to use.</p></div>",

And the drive folder itself no longer works like a normal native folder - you can't go up one folder level with cmd + up arrow for example.

So I'm looking for a pasword manager but am very confused. Here is what it needs to do:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>NO subscription service. It doesn't have to be free, but I don't like the feeling of my passwords being held hostage forcing me to monthly payments to keep access.</li>\n<li>Sharing of the database through iCloud would be ideal. Certainly NO hosting by the developer. I trust Apple to keep their servers secure and online more then a small - comparatively - developer.</li>\n<li>It should run on OSX and iOS and be as lightweight as possible. I don't need to have a mini-app or browser plugins. It shouldn't launch at startup either. Keep it simple.</li>\n<li>It should be usable without an active internet connection.</li>\n<li>A search function that works and some form of tagging system maybe.</li>\n<li>It should have a password generator of some form.</li>\n<li>It would be nice if it were able to use TouchID on the mac and FaceID on iOS.</li>\n<li>M1 support would be great, but that's stretching it a bit I'm afraid.</li>\n<li>I don't need checking of leaked paswords by the developers. That's a feature which leaks too much information IMHO. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>So far the only 2 I know of which ticks most boxes is EnPass and Secrets.
