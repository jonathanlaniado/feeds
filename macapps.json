Although the initial plan was to make it public in a week but thanks to a ProductHunt bug I went live today \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc If you want, you can check the page <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/posts/lasso-6\">here</a> I would appreciate your support.</p>\n<p>Here is a little demo of the app:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/8wr9804q2uca1.gif\">Basic interactions with the app</a></p>\n<p>What problem am I trying to solve? Personally, I had issues remembering complex shortcuts, and even though I was a huge fan of the Rectangle app I could not use its full potential. Things got worse when I bought a new 38\" monitor and I realized that halves and thirds are not enough for me anymore. (just in case you are curious about my setup you can check it here on <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/macsetups/comments/103ddsf/my_home_office/\">Reddit</a>). Also, I wanted to move windows between displays and when you have a couple of monitors, one of them is pretty big, this might be quite a lot of mouse movements.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>So these were my personal problems that I tried to solve by implementing the <a href=\"https://thelasso.app\">Lasso</a> app.</p>\n<p>With the app you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>quickly resize and move windows by selecting grid cells. I believe that click and drag is the most intuitive and fast gesture in macOS.</li>\n<li>move windows between displays</li>\n<li>create, share, import, and export your own layouts</li>\n<li>assign keyboard shortcuts to those layouts for even faster interaction with the app</li>\n<li>customize the UI of the app</li>\n<li>for those coming from the Rectangle or Magnet I made it easy to migrate - just don't keep the onboarding screen \ud83d\ude04</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The app has free 7 days trial period so I'd like to ask everyone to try it out. The single license code is 9.99 Euros and can be activated on a single computer. Let me know if you like it - this would make my launch day a bit better since a lot of things went wrong today. If you don't like it - I would be happy to know why so that I can make it better.</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p></div>",

I've found that each one brings its own unique benefits that other launchers just can't replace.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/eclv0drogfca1.png?width=1932&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=7985ae64ae5d17cce9a5b4ab21c9eb4317659790\">Alfred, Keyboard Maestro, Raycast &amp; Google drive</a></p>\n<p>In this post, I'll be diving into the specific features and use cases of each launcher, and how they've helped me boost my productivity.</p>\n<h1>Alfred (with Powerpack)</h1>\n<p>Alfred is a powerful launcher that I've found to be extremely useful in my daily workflow. One of its main strengths is its ability to launch anything from your mac quickly and efficiently. While Raycast is also great for this, Alfred offers additional functionality that I find to be extremely helpful.</p>\n<p>One of these is to search for your web bookmarks. By creating bookmarks to specific pages of the services that I use regularly, I can easily access them with a simple keyboard shortcut (for example, I have created 3 different bookmarks for my CRM - customers / invoice / quotes - and I can access to each page individually without having to go to the homepage of my CRM and navigate via the menu).</p>\n<p><em>Raycast is also good for bookmarks, but you have to go in a submenu, which is an extra step. (you can define a specific Keyboard shortcut, but with 4 different launchers, I don\u2019t need a fifth one!)</em></p>\n<p>Alfred also allows me to create custom workflows (<a href=\"https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/\">learn more</a>). This feature allows me to automate repetitive tasks and streamline my workflow.</p>\n<p>Another great feature of Alfred is the \"Universal Actions\" functionality (<a href=\"https://www.alfredapp.com/universal-actions/\">learn more</a>). This allows me to select text or files and apply a pre-defined workflow to them. For example, I have some specific search and replace actions that I can apply to a text this way, or I can select a name and launch a LinkedIn search for example thanks to Universal Actions.</p>\n<p>Alfred also has a built-in clipboard manager (<a href=\"https://www.alfredapp.com/help/features/clipboard/\">learn more</a>), which is a great. It allows me to keep track of multiple items that I've copied and pasted, making it easy to access them again later. (<a href=\"https://www.raycast.com/extensions/clipboard-history\">Raycast has this too</a>)</p>\n<p>Finally, Alfred also has a snippet expander feature (<a href=\"https://www.alfredapp.com/help/features/snippets/\">learn more</a>) which is great for storing and reusing frequently used phrases or pieces of text. This saves me a lot of time and makes it easy to insert commonly used information into documents or emails. (<a href=\"https://www.raycast.com/extensions/snippets\">Raycast has it too</a>)</p>\n<p>My Keyboard shortcut : \u2318 + Space bar</p>\n<p>Universal Actions shortcut : \u2325 + Space bar</p>\n<h1>Raycast</h1>\n<p>Raycast is another powerful launcher that I've found to be extremely useful in my daily workflow. One of its main strengths is its ability to communicate with external apps, which makes it an incredibly powerful tool for interacting with other software. The UI is also incredibly well-designed, making it easy to use and navigate.</p>\n<p>One of the ways I use Raycast is for searching for emojis and Unicode symbols. It makes it incredibly easy to find the symbol or emoji I need, and insert it into my text. I also use it to search for information within third-party services like Authy or Notion.</p>\n<p>The built-in calculator is also great, you can do currency calculation or anything you can really think about.</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/wwqimlhwhfca1.png?width=1932&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=40774f4903816eacd2573f1e73ca59dcdebe87b1</p>\n<p>Pro-tip : use it to have your next calendar appointment in your Mac Menu bar, this is really helpful!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/tgx8442llfca1.png?width=1344&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=7deae3f3970da62bd37709c822daa15281b279be\">Show Events in Menu Bar</a></p>\n<p>The only downside is that for most searches, you have to go into a submenu, instead of just typing anything and getting the result you need. But this is a small drawback compared to the power and convenience that Raycast offers in terms of external app communication.</p>\n<p>My Keyboard shortcut : \\^ + \u2325 + Space bar</p>\n<h1>Keyboard Maestro</h1>\n<p>Keyboard Maestro is another powerful tool that I've found to be extremely useful in my daily workflow. Its main strength is its ability to automate tasks that need to be done via UI, and it can use OCR and image recognition to create tasks, which makes it incredibly powerful.</p>\n<p>It took me a lot of time to find the right use cases for Keyboard Maestro, and again a lot of time to correctly create the workflows, but once I did, it has saved me hours every week.</p>\n<p>I use Keyboard Maestro to automate repetitive tasks, like accounting and invoicing customers. It's incredibly powerful for anything that requires you to use your mouse. With its OCR and <a href=\"https://wiki.keyboardmaestro.com/action/Find_Image_on_Screen\">image recognition</a> capabilities, it can automate tasks that involve reading or interpreting what\u2019s on my screen.</p>\n<p>Most people don\u2019t use the launcher included with Keyboard Maestro, but as soon as you learn to use it, you can find new use cases for it all the time. It's a great tool for automating repetitive tasks and saving time on your daily workflow.</p>\n<p>My Keyboard shortcut :  \u2325 + \u2318 + Space bar<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhho2Bhzh5w\">Here is a video that show how to set the KM Macro launcher</a></p>\n<h1>Google Drive launcher</h1>\n<p>I've used the Alfred Workflow and the Raycast extension for accessing Google Drive documents before, but I've found that the official Google Drive launcher is more stable and convenient for my needs.</p>\n<p>One of the main strengths of the Google Drive launcher is its ability to easily find Google Drive documents. It integrates seamlessly with the Google Drive platform and makes it easy to access and search for the files I need.</p>\n<p>The downside is that it can be slow at times and it doesn't have as many filtering options as the Google Drive website. But overall, it's a great tool for anyone who heavily uses Google Drive and needs quick access to their documents.</p>\n<p>My Keyboard shortcut :  \u2325 + \u2318 + g</p></div>",

In particular I've added:  autocorrect, substitutions, user replacements, and improved spell checking.</p>\n<p>These are fundamental features that I don't think many Mac apps handle very well due to limitations in Cocoa's standard implementation. I'm building Bike's text editor from scratch so get to make my own design decisions... hopefully I'm making an improvement!</p>\n<p>I've also posted some discussion and demo videos at the following link. Please take a look, give Bike 1.7 a try, and let me know what you think.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.hogbaysoftware.com/posts/bike-improved-text-checking/\">Bike: Improved macOS text checking</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thanks,\nJesse</p></div>",

Another wish of mine was for it to be a web extension that feels native to the browser vs an app extension that looks out of place. </p>\n<p>After waiting long enough, I decided to build one myself. A little preview of <a href=\"https://taptab.manibatra.xyz\">Tap Tab</a>. The web extension APIs for managing tabs are pretty locked down in Safari, but I have already found a lot of value in using the extension. Some of the features that I find very useful(in the middle of building a few of these) : \n-   Driven by keyboard shortcuts. I can see the tabs I have open at a glance and switch between them.\n-   Fuzzy search to quickly filter down to the tab you want. \n-   Quick switching between two tabs.\n-   Ability to pin, mute, and close the tab right from the extension.</p>\n<p>Say hello, and tell me what features you would like the extension to have!!</p></div>",

Since then, I gave it a bit more work and put it on the Mac App Store, and updated it to fit the requests of its users.</p>\n<p>This week, I released TouchRuler 2.0, which includes tons of features that will make your measurements faster and more precise than ever before; such as numbers on the ruler for at a glance measurements, the Control Row for quick adjustments, the Click Pad for precision measurements that can go right into your clipboard, and more.</p>\n<p>This release also adds TouchRuler mini, a handy little widget that maintains the customisation and precision that TouchRuler has, all while resting in your Notification Center. You can even drag it out of the Notification Center at any time across your Mac to measure anything you're working on in a flash.</p>\n<p>TouchRuler fits right at home on any Mac, but when paired with a MacBook Pro, you can measure any real-world object with ease right from your Touch Bar!</p>\n<p>With colourful themes, precision automatic and manual calibration, and of course an elegant ruler for your Touch Bar and Notification Center; TouchRuler is a fun spin on other rulers on the App Store and of course the generic plastic rulers floating around, all while retaining the same utility that you'd expect on any other ruler.</p>\n<p>TouchRuler is great for designers, architects, students, scientists, mathematicians, and the rest of us who just need a ruler available to access wherever we are.</p>\n<p>You don't have to take my word for it, TouchRuler has also been featured in <a href=\"https://www.ifun.de/touchruler-lineal-fuer-den-mac-bildschirm-und-die-touch-bar-176304/\">ifun.de</a> and <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/products/touchruler#touchruler\">Product Hunt</a>!</p>\n<p>You can grab it on the Mac App Store for less than the price of a physical ruler (one that doesn't have all the cool tricks TouchRuler has!), at just $0.99USD!</p>\n<p>Tell me what you think, I'm open for feedback, and answering any questions regarding the app! I hope you all like it, if so please feel free to leave TouchRuler a review on the App Store! There's also ten free codes available in the comments section! Thanks for checking out TouchRuler!</p>\n<p>App Store link: <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/touchruler/id1581679817\">https://apps.apple.com/us/app/touchruler/id1581679817</a></p>\n<p>Check out my other work here: <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/davidmazzeo\">https://sites.google.com/view/davidmazzeo</a></p></div>",

Follow the link for details, a screencast (4 min), and download. (this is paid feature, but there is a no signup 7 day trial so you can play with it)</p>\n<p>In the past I have used plain text formats (like .taskpaper and .markdown) for my apps. I've grown sick of seeing and parsing syntax characters, so this time around I am taking a rich text approach.</p>\n<p>Rich text looks clean, but editing is problematic. You don't have precise control/visibility into the formatting. It's hidden behind the text. There are no formatting characters to guide you like you have in Markdown. This is particularly problematic when you want to insert text at formatting boundaries.</p>\n<p>Bike solves this with \"typing affinity\". This lets you precisely specify which formatting to use at those boundaries. It does this by adding an extra text caret state at these boundaries. This extra state allows you to point the text caret upstream or downstream to the formatting you want.</p>\n<p>Other interesting features include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Link Buttons: Insert a dedicated \"open\" button after each link so there is no conflict between editing link text and opening the link.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Keyboard Centric Formatting Popover: Remember a single keyboard shortcut and have full keyboard access to formatting commands. No mouse needed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Visible Typing Attributes: Show hidden typing attribute state (when it cannot be visually determined by looking at surrounding text) as part of the text caret.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please take a look and let me know what you think. I'm happy to answer questions and would love to hear your thoughts on ways to improve rich text editing further.</p></div>",

I have been a user of Alfred for quite a long time and I installed Raycast the other day, out of curiosity. I find it quite cool and there are some interesting ideas in the app. I'm a web developer so the ability of quickly building extensions using React is quite great for me. The only thing I'm missing, though, and that is quite the dealbreaker is Universal Actions. The ability to select something as context and then start Alfred to act upon that context is really useful. Is there anything similar to that in Raycast?</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Thx!</p></div>",

Over the years, I've recommended their apps to friends, family, &amp; many more. I am heavily invested in their apps with my workflows. </p>\n<p>I\u2019ve updated Spark on iOS &amp; iPadOS and those are solid upgrades with a few great new features. But what happened to the v3 version for macOS? My gut reaction was that we Mac users got thrown under the bus to make Spark work on Windows via an electron app.</p>\n<p>Let me explain what I mean. <br />\n(Everything below is also in this Craft doc \u21e8 <a href=\"https://www.craft.do/s/AoGwif29ATqkKc\">https://www.craft.do/s/AoGwif29ATqkKc</a> which might be easier to read.)</p>\n<p><strong>[1]</strong> \ud83d\udc49\ufe0f<strong>Swiping actions</strong> are gone. Touchpads are now only useful for scrolling now but nothing else \ud83d\ude22 I use a trackpad on both the MacBook &amp; Desktop macs with the same swipe settings as on my iOS &amp; iPadOS devices. Is this a permanent change?</p>\n<p><strong>[2]</strong> Where did the <strong>column view</strong> go? The way to navigate is now unbearably \ud83e\udda5 slower without it. </p>\n<p><strong>[3]</strong> <strong>Services integrations</strong> \ud83d\ude45 are no more? I heavily use them with v2\u2026 now all of them are gone in v3? Now what? </p>\n<p><strong>[4]</strong> <strong>Composing e-mails</strong> \u270d\ufe0f\u2709\ufe0f now has only 2 options: full-screen and compact. Compact cannot be resized or popped out. What gives? Then when on the new \"Home\" screen, the compact compose view blocks \u2b1b\ufe0f almost completely the\u00a0\"Open Inbox\" button. This is not usable in this state.</p>\n<p><strong>[5]</strong> No more \ud83c\udf2c\ufe0f <strong>font options</strong>? No more \ud83c\udf2c\ufe0f <strong>font sizes</strong>?</p>\n<p><strong>[6]</strong> <strong>Multi-tasking</strong> \ud83e\udd39 is in the past? There is no way to compose two e-mails at the same time now. This might work for people who barely write emails but for those relying on it heavily this is not just making it cumbersome but it is a deal breaker.</p>\n<p><strong>[6]</strong> Idle <strong>CPU Time</strong> \ud83d\udca4 usage comparison. Both apps were opened to the same draft email &amp; minimized to the dock for 20 minutes. Remarkably, <strong>\u2460</strong> v2 used a \u2155 of the resources or in other words <strong>\u2461</strong> v3 used x5 more.</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/78u41ujzz5s91.png?width=1482&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be2165700c935dc80bd451ffb44dbcd010a4c1d9</p>\n<p><strong>[7]</strong> What is the \u201c<strong>Home</strong>\" \ud83c\udfda\ufe0f screen really useful for? It takes extra clicks now to get to my inbox, I get a new image shown and I have no say in what it is. </p>\n<p><strong>[8]</strong> The <strong>menu popovers</strong> \ud83d\udde8 are crazy big, attention grabbing &amp; in the way.</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/47bi9xk606s91.png?width=1082&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7596418dd76afd5f70696c6366cb1549489af21</p>\n<p><strong>[9]</strong> Native macOS <strong>smooth scrolling</strong> \ud83d\udcdc is now gone. It's a small thing but when you scroll all the time, it is a noticeable omission. Same applies to <strong>window resizing</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>[10]</strong> The new <strong>minimum compose window size</strong> is unnecessarily large. Spark v3 minimum screen area is x2.5 larger than of Spark v2.</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/xhaa4vga06s91.png?width=582&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=744baab854d5a8530468506a73ec86ab2132a685</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/wviwqquc06s91.png?width=1282&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f03518dc4db3f8f9a4a63f577c0bbe693e7fcf6</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/ggcu4qee06s91.png?width=1090&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8cfe0805e70c4cb82e971e4b9d2099014b374af3</p>\n<p><strong>[11]</strong> Wasted <strong>empty space</strong> \ud83d\uddd1\ufe0f is unfortunately all over the UI. Just the left side in Spark v3 is 106pt &amp; only 31pt in Spark v2.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/3t3f1q6g06s91.png?width=370&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4b4f3fc08de41c2e2232322758f38b745bdb10c2</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/fuid1i7h06s91.png?width=191&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e9153352fa9e73a9b62b6e13793332f88020207d</p>\n<p><strong>[12]</strong> Last but far from least, <strong>templates</strong>, where \ud83d\udd0e are they in v3?</p>\n<p>So, the way things stand, \u2728Spark 2\u2728 is better and I cannot switch over to v3 on macOS like I did on my iOS/iPadOS devices. That begs the question, how can this be the new Spark? What is the expected support timeframe for v2? When will it be sunset/discontinued?</p>\n<p>Curious what other Spark users think about this big change/departure from v2 to v3.</p></div>",

Trypa is a menu bar app, that allows you to watch for generic devices (i.e any iOS device) and also specific devices being connected or disconnected.</p>\n<p>So for example you could play a screaming full volume alarm + trigger an sms shortcut when someone plugs a usb drive into your Mac, or just lock the screen.</p>\n<p>You could speak an audible warning if your phone is unplugged from your computer, or if your laptop is unplugged from power.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/reqfjjs38jq91.png?width=617&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5bf0a5ba5b860d4069b783aed37cfc18b0f45b60\">Main Menu</a></p>\n<p><strong>What can you watch for currently?</strong></p>\n<p>It's limited at the moment, currently: Time, Network settings, Displays, USB devices, Audio devices, Laptop Power and System appearance.
