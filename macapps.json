I wrote this list because some of these may completely suit your use case right now.</em></p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><strong>Remember, the key functions of your external brain are:</strong></p>\n<p>- Capture, storage &amp; frictionless retrieval</p>\n<p>- Structured thought</p>\n<p>- Note-taking/writing</p>\n<p>- Freeflow thinking &amp; idea sex</p>\n<p>- Publishing</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><strong>To achieve this, the key features are:</strong></p>\n<p>- Quick capture</p>\n<p>- Omni-bar search</p>\n<p>- Backlinking</p>\n<p>- Tags</p>\n<p>- Own your notes</p>\n<p>- Networked thought</p>\n<p>- Mindmapping</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>These apps nail the above.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Roam Research -</strong> great for academics and non-linear thinkers.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There is a learning curve, but once your ideas start flirting with each other they will start having great sex. Now has a mac app.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/2qv2wonmdls71.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca0c5a9756133da0e4450d0be967bd4f848d1ae9\">Roam Research</a></p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><strong>2) Craft docs:</strong> Offline-first app with a visual focus, clean formatting. It's what Notion should have grown up to be, if it didn't fall in with the naughty cloud-based boys from the other street.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/peaxwb0pdls71.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=300ca9a96b05ab5b778b8829e33cc80560f5711d</p>\n<p><strong>3) Obsidian:</strong> HIGHLY extensible, markdown-based with graphical backlinking and mac-based. Free in beta.  Has a learning curve but super powerful.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/wue0berkels71.jpg?width=2656&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=48ded193d68b937cdc3f1c27db3f037928990e51</p>\n<p><strong>4) Apple notes.</strong> Seriously. Give it another try.  MacOS monterey introduced collaboration, tags, quick-note. While it lacks backlinking and mindmapping, there's nothing faster.   <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5zsJKa8x4I\">here's</a> why I moved from evernote to apple notes.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/avweppdpels71.jpg?width=2742&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f36f5417cb89ea8a0b870b290e6db3bb8011752d</p>\n<p><strong>5) Mindnode</strong>: I've tried every mindmapping software out there. They're all bloated and ugly. Mindnode is totally frictionless and a pleasure to use.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/7kh9k2cxels71.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe5a04eacd73b343a1d08932772a466b1193ea65</p>\n<p>Being able to spacially compress data is like having prosthesis for your memory.

The singularity is coming fellas. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2gVlQb6caE\">Here's</a> my exact workflow to use these systems for maximum productivity.</p>\n<p>For me, minimising friction is the big driver.  It doesn't matter how sophisticated your system is. If it's not smooth for you to use, it's almost useless.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/5sutbj1qfls71.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b682f7b90cdb55ee0b501abeb7126b3841975ad</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><strong>A note on paid vs free software:</strong> There seems to be a culture on reddit that nobody ever wants to pay for software. I get it - it's code on a screen and has no physical deliverables etc. But this is your <strong>external brain</strong> you're paying for. It's at least worth a few quid per month. You get what you pay for. My life got better when I stopped trying to jimmy everything on the cheap with exclusively opensource/freeware. Saying that, most of the above have free versions.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Happy to answer any questions below.</p></div>",

For example, there's a page to my bank that has a massively long URL, so I created a shortcut named <em>bankxx</em> and as soon as I hit the spacebar, the entire 60-character website gets typed out. </p>\n<p>The developer regularly puts out updates, and never a upcharge, even years later.</p>\n<p>I've no connection to the dev, just passing on an app that is one of those joys to use.</p></div>",

It doesn't have to be free, but I don't like the feeling of my passwords being held hostage forcing me to monthly payments to keep access.</li>\n<li>Sharing of the database through iCloud would be ideal.

Keep it simple.</li>\n<li>It should be usable without an active internet connection.</li>\n<li>A search function that works and some form of tagging system maybe.</li>\n<li>It should have a password generator of some form.</li>\n<li>It would be nice if it were able to use TouchID on the mac and FaceID on iOS.</li>\n<li>M1 support would be great, but that's stretching it a bit I'm afraid.</li>\n<li>I don't need checking of leaked paswords by the developers. That's a feature which leaks too much information IMHO. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>So far the only 2 I know of which ticks most boxes is EnPass and Secrets. I'm leaning towards secrets because it look simple and lightweight.</p>\n<p>Any options I overlooked? or any insights?</p></div>",

There are so many great apps and tools that I use every day, but it seemed that something lively and chill is missing.Then, I got back home, and I remembered the old days when I was in middle and high school. While I was studying, my puppy usually slept around on the floor. Those were some of the peaceful moments that I had.</p>\n<p>Then I came up with the idea of building a Mac app to have a sleeping pet on the menu bar.Besides, this tiny pet can remind you to take a break too. \\^\\^This is a paid app ($3.99) with the following features.\u2022 A list of 12 pets that are exclusively designed\u2022 Remind you to take a break and get back to work better\u2022 Freely select the reminder time: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, or 60 minutes\u2022 Choose your favorite break reminder quote\u2022 Minimalistic design with no dock icon\u2022 Compatible with Dark Mode\u2022 Compatible with all modern macOS versions\u2022 More pets are added to the list</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://reddit.com/link/p8r0ys/video/qjurq4lilpi71/player\">PetBar app preview</a></p>\n<p>You can check it out here on <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/petbar-a-pet-on-your-menu-bar/id1580266242?l=en&amp;mt=12\">App Store.</a>If you are one of our users, please feel free to send me a request for your favorite pet if it is missing.I am going to include it in the next version for you.</p>\n<p>If you are interested in the whole process of building this Mac app, you can read <a href=\"https://quangctkm9207.medium.com/a-story-behind-building-my-first-mac-app-it-is-a-cute-one-too-7b508481ff89\">the story here.</a> Thanks for reading, and have a great weekend!  </p>\n<p>---- <br />\nUPDATED.<br />\nThanks a lot for everyone's feedback. This is the first time that I got such a number of kind and useful feedback.<br />\nAll of them are noted. Some of them are updated immediately on version 1.2.0. (available on App Store).<br />\n- New pets are added: <strong>Rat, Dinosaur, Wolf</strong><br />\n- Have an option to launch at startup/login<br />\n- Do not start the reminder timer when the app just launches<br />\n- Have an option to stop the timer when the screen is locked</p></div>",

So that is why I created SigmaOS. Here is a list of a few features you can expect (there are more):</p>\n<p><strong>Workspaces</strong> Organize your searches, pages and web-apps by project</p>\n<p><strong>Split screen</strong> Easy to use splitscreen for whenever you need two tabs side by side</p>\n<p><strong>Snooze pages</strong> Keep your workspaces clear by hiding pages you don\u2019t need right now</p>\n<p><strong>Browser inbox</strong> You can send pages to people straight into their SigmaOS</p>\n<p><strong>Privacy</strong> The model is not ad based so your data is safe. It is a subsciption based model</p>\n<p><strong>And many more</strong>  todos,  shortcuts, reminders, dark theme etc...</p>\n<p>Here are a couple pictures to give you an idea:</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/wj9qcagekpf71.png?width=699&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98fdb84d45fc0da36eb4a0b36a91219a8b3e5392</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/lxl5l2nfkpf71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=50ff78d4e826f052292913c36c7df84bd7bd5180</p>\n<p>And here is a GIF to see it in use: <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/Vo1Hxof\">https://imgur.com/a/Vo1Hxof</a></p>\n<p>If you want to download it just head over to <a href=\"https://ihatemybrowser.com\">ihatemybrowser.com</a>. First 2 weeks are free and im working on sorting out discounts/credits for early users that like it and provide feedback.</p>\n<p>Feel free to join our slack community if you want to come and chat about sigmaOS and give feedback/report bugs. I am also active on reddit so just PM if have any questions or need anything.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://Sigmaos.com/community\">Sigmaos.com/community</a></p></div>",

Furthermore, after achieving your desired color you can copy it by using either a predefined format or a format defined by you. And this is only one of many other scenarios.</p>\n<p>This app also has an in-app purchase available where the Pro version can be acquired for more features (with many more to come).

The app works alongside Teams to help improve your productivity.</p>\n<p>It's available from <a href=\"https://teamite.sengi.co.za/\">https://teamite.sengi.co.za/</a>. You can use discount code <strong>macapps</strong> for 50% off.</p>\n<p>I created the app initially as a fun side project and for my own benefit, but I've decided to try make something of it. I use it every day and it's changed the way I work. I can track when my team is busy, follow Microsoft Project Planner (.mpp) tasks way easier, and I can quickly glance at my schedule without losing track of my work.</p>\n<p>My favourite feature lets you create groups to view all of your coworkers' schedules/availability from one place. The teams aren't linked to any actual teams or channels so you have total control of what they're named and who is included. You can also view your detailed event information from this screen so you know what you've got going on at the same time as someone else is free.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/hmap6z1nple71.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d00a06a87e1c4864a323abc9063e95e74129d921\">Schedules view</a></p>\n<p>You can view your schedule in a <em>week view</em> similar to the Teams calendar. One of the nicest features is it shows you how much time you have between meetings to get things done:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/al28xvbople71.png?width=890&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d81485a37e6513ddfb5101f8201acae63f4a3804\">See time between events</a></p>\n<p>The app also has a feature to view Microsoft Project Planner .mpp files in a gantt chart, and limit it to only the people you are interested in, and sort it in chronological order for easier task tracking. This has been hugely useful for following work projects with thousands of tasks that I'm not at all involved in.</p>\n<p>Please give it a try and I hope you like it :)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://teamite.sengi.co.za/\">https://teamite.sengi.co.za/</a></p></div>",
