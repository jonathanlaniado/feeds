Sidebar is the modern and most customizable Dock replacement for macOS out there. In general, it makes the space that the Dock would occupy a lot more useful.</p>\n<p>Since my last post here, some\u00a0<strong>cool new features have been added</strong>, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sidebar now offers a customization mode that combines all context specific options in one completely overhauled user interface, allowing you to easily customize various settings</li>\n<li>Application previews have been redesigned and in addition to the classic miniature application preview windows now also offers a list view for more cozy overview</li>\n<li>Two new ways of displaying running applications have been added, called \"Highlight\". Using this running indicator, Sidebar will show a highlighted area around running applications, with optionally the window count next to the icon</li>\n<li>Sidebar now offers a built-in functionality to either move all application windows, or those of a specific application to a specific screen</li>\n<li>Multimedia support has been enhanced to deal with new restrictions introduced by Apple starting with macOS 14.5. Starting with this update you can control Spotify and Apple Music again, even when running macOS 14.5+</li>\n<li>And of course a lot of other small improvements, performance improvements and bug fixes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For a full list of features added and bugs fixed, have a look at the roadmap at the\u00a0<a href=\"https://sidebarapp.net/changelog/\">Full Changelog</a>\u00a0If you want to see more screenshots of the app and a comprehensive overview of all features, please visit\u00a0<a href=\"https://sidebarapp.net/\">https://sidebarapp.net</a></p>\n<p>As usual, I've reset all prior trial licenses, so you can try Sidebar again, even if you tested it before.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m happy to support you with any questions, problems, bug reports, feature requests etc. :)</p><div><br></div><img src=\"https://i.redd.it/yrds8qjczywe1.png\" />",

This update is honestly the one I\u2019m most proud of, so here\u2019s what\u2019s new and improved:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Keyboard Shortcuts + Cheat Sheet:</strong> You can now navigate and control wBlock with fast hotkeys. There\u2019s even an in-app cheat sheet\u2014your fingers never need to leave the keyboard.</li>\n<li><strong>Custom Filter Lists:</strong> Add, manage, and toggle any ad-blocking list you want\u2014besides the built-in ones. Imported lists? No problem. Sidebar toggle bugs and filter duplication are fixed too.</li>\n<li><strong>Epic Speed Boost (No More Lag!):</strong> The UI is dramatically faster. All the sluggishness, animation lag, and slow filter updates are gone\u2014background processing everywhere.</li>\n<li><strong>(Almost) Bulletproof YouTube Ad-Blocking:</strong> Ad scripts now inject <em>earlier</em> for much better blocking. Enjoy cleaner YouTube (including the homepage and while watching videos). Note that some users still have issues when visiting a YouTube video by pasting a link; YouTube is becoming really annoying when it comes to ads and I'll need some extra time to figure this out.</li>\n<li><strong>No More Annoying Permission Popups:</strong> You won\u2019t be bugged for data access every launch anymore! All that background permission nagging is fixed for good.</li>\n<li><strong>Built-in Language &amp; Custom Filters:</strong> Chinese, Spanish, Portuguese, and many international filters now work flawlessly. Got issues with AdGuard lists before? They\u2019re all fixed.</li>\n<li><strong>See What You\u2019re Blocking:</strong> Filter lists now show the real number of rules, and you can click to go right to the homepage/source.</li>\n<li><strong>Download Progress for Filter Updates:</strong> Never wonder \u201cis it hung?\u201d again\u2014there\u2019s now a live progress bar while updating filters.</li>\n<li><strong>Cleaner, Simpler Interface:</strong> The sidebar is gone, popups are more intuitive, and, finally, every log window and popup can be closed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are ton of smaller bug fixes and UX tweaks too, from \u201crefresh all filters\u201d to improved default settings and support for more macOS versions. The menu, tooltips, and every page should feel easier and friendlier!</p>\n<p><strong>\ud83d\ude4f Thank you to everyone on Reddit and GitHub who\u2019s reported bugs, shared ideas, and encouraged me along the way.</strong> Your support and feedback have shaped every part of this project and made wBlock what it is today! This truly is built <em>for</em> the community, <em>by</em> the community.</p>\n<p>If you haven\u2019t tried wBlock yet, or you gave up on ad-blockers that \u201calmost\u201d worked\u2014give it a go! And if you enjoy it, please star the repo, open suggestions, or just spread the word.</p>\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://github.com/0xCUB3/wBlock\">check out the GitHub</a> or <a href=\"https://testflight.apple.com/join/DFGenhRn\">download it now using TestFlight</a>.</p>\n<p><em>(P.S Massive thanks again to everyone who gave honest feedback, feature ideas, or just a kind word along the way.

Perfect for everything from quick cooking reminders to tracking long-term project deadlines visually, right on your screen.</p>\n<p><strong>Why did I build it?</strong> <br />\nI originally wanted a timer that was always visible on my screen, but didn't constantly block me from clicking on windows underneath it. That led to the \"pass-through\" feature, and from there, I kept finding new things I wanted to add, resulting in the app you see today.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m releasing it <strong>completely free</strong> on the App Store (no ads, no IAPs, no catches) to keep it accessible for anyone who might find it useful.</p>\n<p><strong>Here's what it can do (Key features):</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Super Easy Creation:</strong> Click the menu bar icon and drag \u2013 the farther you drag, the longer the timer.</li>\n<li><strong>Click-Through Timers (Pass-Through Mode):</strong> Timers fade slightly on hover, letting you click <em>right through</em> them to interact with content underneath.</li>\n<li><strong>On-Overlay Controls:</strong> Quickly resize, move, add/subtract time, pause, open the manager, or close the timer directly on the overlay itself.</li>\n<li><strong>Deep Appearance Customization:</strong> Fonts, backgrounds, colors, gradients, opacity, progress ring styles \u2013 make it look <em>exactly</em> how you want. Save your favorite color themes, too.</li>\n<li><strong>Default Timer Settings:</strong> Define your preferred style and behavior once, and all new timers will use those settings automatically.</li>\n<li><strong>Flexible Time Display:</strong> Show units from seconds up to years. Timers can auto-switch units (e.g., minutes to seconds when under 60s), and you can optionally display remaining time as a percentage.</li>\n<li><strong>Recurring Timers:</strong> Set timers to repeat daily, weekly, or at custom intervals.</li>\n<li><strong>Custom End Notifications:</strong> Create unique notifications for when specific timers complete.</li>\n<li><strong>Visible Across Spaces:</strong> Timers stay visible even when you switch between Spaces.</li>\n<li><strong>Countdown Manager:</strong> A central window to view, edit, and manage all your timers.</li>\n<li><strong>Window Behavior:</strong> Control whether timers float above everything, act like standard windows, or ignore screen boundaries.</li>\n<li><strong>And More:</strong> Includes keyboard shortcuts, options to hide timers until they start, reverse progress bar direction, and other useful features.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What's Next &amp; Feedback:</strong> <br />\nThis is just v1.0! I have a list of features and optimizations I'd love to add, especially if there's interest from the community.</p>\n<p>Please check it out! I'd love to hear what you think. Let me know about any bugs you find or features you'd like to see added.</p>\n<p><strong>Download link:</strong> <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/countdown-timer-pro/id6744842468\">https://apps.apple.com/us/app/countdown-timer-pro/id6744842468</a></p>\n<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Made a free Mac app to create highly customizable, click-through countdown timer overlays.

            "content_html": "<p>Hi! Johnson (dev) here! Excited to share some of these new features with the community.</p>\n<p><strong>Dropdown mode (Traditional menu mode)</strong> - Antinote can now live permanently in your menu bar, dropping down when needed. It will show over full-screen apps and also on all desktops. You can change how big you want Antinote to be in settings.</p>\n<p><strong>Cmd-V OCR</strong> - Any image you drag (and now paste) into Antinote will get automatically OCR'd into plain text. Perfect for catching things during screen-shares or hard-to-copy data tables.</p>\n<p><strong>AutoPaste</strong> - Type \"paste\" and Antinote will listen to your clipboard. Anything you put in the clipboard will be automatically pasted in the note. Change the delimiter to anything you like. Great to skip the tedious cmd-tab / cmd+v part of these quick workflows.</p>\n<p><strong>Raycast / Alfred Extensions -</strong> Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/sc0\">PanKacper</a>, we are now <a href=\"https://www.raycast.com/sc0/antinote\">officially in the Raycast Store</a>, and also have an <a href=\"https://github.com/sc0/antinote-alfred-workflow/tree/main\">Alfred Extension</a>. These will let you create notes (blank or with content), pin/unpin, and search your notes directly from your favourite super-app.</p>\n<p><strong>Translucency -</strong> (macOS 15+) - Make the background translucent with Apple's materials and change the opacity of the effect to blend it with your favourite theme.</p>\n<p><strong>8 new themes</strong> -  Piccolo, A24, Tartan, Agrabah, Maud'Dib, Knight, Sanrio, Shadow Moses. Not sure how many of you will get the references, but each is inspired by something from my childhood.</p>\n<p>Every single one of these were suggestions from the community. Please <a href=\"https://discord.gg/2SKQbJM9Mz\">join us on Discord.</a> </p>\n<p>Also - I wanted to shout out this YouTube channel (AppsNTips) for making the first Antinote video out in the wild: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKGOPgOiuI\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKGOPgOiuI</a></p>\n<p><strong>Try it out here:</strong></p>\n<h1><a href=\"https://antinote.io\">Antinote.io</a></h1>\n<p>7 day free trial</p>\n<p><strong>$5 one-time.</strong> Forever updates.</p>",

Would you be interested in a version with more tailored features for Mac? Your feedback would really help guide my efforts.  </p>\n<p>I used to work as an iOS developer in a well-paying job, but I always had the urge to build something of my own rather than work on other people\u2019s ideas. Since I'm still young, I figured this was the perfect time to take the leap, quit my job, and give it a real shot.</p>\n<p>I've always been passionate about note-taking, so I decided to build one myself. I know the market is crowded, but I wanted to create something with features that stand out\u2014and make it\u00a0<strong><em>completely free</em></strong>\u00a0to use.</p>\n<p>The app,\u00a0<em>Notedrafts</em>, supports three different types of notes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>PDF/Notebook-style notes</li>\n<li>Infinite Canvas (similar to Apple Freeform)</li>\n<li>Vertical Notes (like the Apple Notes app)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On top of that, you can fully customize templates to suit your workflow. Notedrafts offers planners, habit trackers, and more\u2014and you can tweak them however you like, from changing dates to adjusting the number of habits you want to track.</p>\n<p>It's available on the App Store.

As a software engineer, I don't like that. Transparency matters.</p>\n<p>So, I decided to make my commercial <a href=\"https://clipbook.app\">clipboard manager</a> open source. Anyone can inspect the source code, verify that data stays local and never leaves the user's device. Anyone can <a href=\"https://github.com/vladimir-ikryanov/ClipBook/blob/main/README.md#building-clipbook\">build the app from source</a> and use it.</p>\n<p><strong>GitHub</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/vladimir-ikryanov/ClipBook\">https://github.com/vladimir-ikryanov/ClipBook</a></p>\n<p>At the same time, the app is still commercial, as I need to cover hosting, tooling, and development costs. I know this means anyone can build the app from source and use it for free. Or even rebrand and sell it, but I think the trade-off is worth it.</p>\n<p>What do you think about this approach? Would you trust an open-source commercial app more than a closed-source one? Do you think I made a mistake?</p>",

As a Uni student, here are the apps that I use every day and my honest user experience and feedback. Most of the apps installed are free, but any that aren't will have their price factored into my overall review. </p>\n<p><strong>All of these apps are super easy to install and use and don't require any complex coding knowledge!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. Media Mate</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wouter01.github.io/MediaMate/\">Media Mate Website</a></p>\n<p>I came across this app 2+ years ago, right when it launched. I hated the Vanilla macOS volume and brightness HUD, and Media Mate was an amazing alternative. In the last two years, the developer(s) have continued to refine and perfect this app with new features and customization options. It is one of the easiest apps to install and set up thanks to its super intuitive UI. While other Notch Apps have come since then that offer more features, none of them do what Media Mate does, as well as Media Mate does it. This app is perfect for anyone looking to refresh some aspects of the outdated macOS HUD. As one of the few paid apps on this list, the modest price tag of 7 euros (roughly $7 USD or $10 CAD) gives you lifetime access to 5 licences. I was more than satisfied with the price when I bought it 2 years ago and since then, the dev(s) have blown me away time and time again. Their ability to constantly release bug-free updates (I have never encountered a bug in my time using it) and well-refined make Media Mate integrate beautifully into macOS. To further emphasize how seamless this app is, I have found myself looking at a friend's computer when they change their volume and almost forgetting the Media Mate isn't a part of the Vanilla macOS. THAT'S HOW SEAMLESSLY THIS APP INTEGRATES INTO YOUR MAC!</p>\n<p>After over 2 years of use, I can confidently say that Media Mate gets a 10/10 from me. It does its job beautifully, and updates never feel like they were rushed out unfinished. Apps have come since which try to be better by having more bells and whistles but for those who just want an app which perfectly adds to your Mac, Media Mate stands alone as the best.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Ice</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/jordanbaird/Ice/blob/main/README.md\">Ice Github Page</a></p>\n<p>Inspired by Bartender, Ice allows you to customize your menu bar and give it a clean and minimalist look. I love that this app solved my constant gripe about having a cluttered menu bar. I got this app initially before getting a Bartender key from someone else, so I'm able to give a direct comparison between the two. You are able to decide between \u201cAlways shown,\u201d \u201cHidden,\u201d and \u201cAlways Hidden.\u201d</p>\n<p>Always shown is pretty self-explanatory. Items in the always-shown section will always be visible. I only have the date and time there, but that's just my love of minimalism speaking.</p>\n<p>Hidden is for your icons that you use semi-regularly but don't want to see all the time. These icons are revealed by dragging the mouse to the top of the screen. With the icons hiding again after moving the mouse away. This is where I keep my Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and other icons that I visit on a fairly regular basis but not too often.</p>\n<p>Always hidden works the same as the hidden section, except it doesn't reveal when you drag your mouse to the top of the screen. Instead, simply hold option and click the top of the screen to reveal the always hidden bar, which goes back to being hidden once you move the mouse away from the top of the screen. I really only use this for certain apps which force an icon into the menu bar with no ability to disable it.</p>\n<p>There are two reasons why, in my opinion, Ice is actually a better app than Bartender, which I will explain below.</p>\n<p>Number one: IT'S FREE. The beauty of the app being free is that if you don't like it, you can uninstall and never think about it again. For offering all the same features without the cost, there isn't any drawback to at least trying out Ice before spending a whopping $30 CAD (approx 20 USD and Euro) on Bartender. After showing Ice to the person who gave me their bartender key, he was pretty pissed that he'd spent all that money, and I was able to get the same thing for free.</p>\n<p>Number two: This may not be much to everyone, but I love it. When Bartender hides apps from your menu bar, it replaces them with a plain grey space, which is pretty lame compared to what Ice has to offer. With Ice, any area which isn't being used in your menu bar is instead seamlessly replaced by your wallpaper! This feature works regardless of if you're using a still image or a dynamic wallpaper. Ice will always fill the space back in, which makes the menu bar much smaller and your screen much bigger! It reminds me of when Apple switched from the notch to the dynamic island with the iPhone 14. Even though there wasn't much more screen space being added, the screen feels much bigger and the camera housing feels less pronounced than with the notch. Overall, while this feature doesn't serve much of a use, it makes the top of your screen feel much cleaner without the grey bar running along the top of it.</p>\n<p>Overall, Ice gets an 8/10 from me. It has a few bugs now and then, but its dev team is super responsive to feedback and works really hard to fix bugs in a timely manner. Even with that in mind, there is no world where spending $30 on Bartender is better than at least trying Ice at no cost. For me, This is a rare example of an app where the free version is better than the paid.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Icon Champ</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macenhance.com/iconchamp.html\">IconChamp Install</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=487G8qaBky0&amp;ab_channel=MacProTips\">IconChamp YouTube Tutorial</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://macosicons.com/#/\">Mac Icons</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/image2icon-make-your-icons/id992115977?mt=12\">Image2Icon File Converter</a></p>\n<p>One of my most recent additions, IconChamp is another app that helps you modernize your Mac by giving you the ability to change your app icons to whatever you want. I love the dark icons that came out in iOS18 and wanted a way to give all the apps in my dock a common theme.</p>\n<p>This app has both a free and paid version. The free version allows you to change any apps that you have installed manually, as well as your folder icons on your user folders. The paid version is the only app I've ever been able to find which gives you the ability to change the icons of the base macOS apps and folders. The paid version gives you 3 keys and comes in at a price of approx $15 CAD (approx 10 USD and Euro). It's not the cheapest app, and most people will probably be more than fine with the free version, but the paid version gives that extra bit of personalization we all love (it's the reason that I, along with so many others, are in this subreddit in the first place).</p>\n<p>The beauty of IconChamp is that it's a simple drag-and-drop process, it doesn't require you to disable any security features, and any changes can be reverted with (literally) one click of a button. Since the release of macOS Sequoia, the app has gained a few bugs which, as far as I can see, haven't had any attempts of being remedied. I had to play around with it a bit and came across a YouTube video which helped me install the right version and gave the full run tutorial. I was able to get the majority of my images from the website featured in the video. For the apps which I couldn't find a version I liked on the website, I simply googled what I was looking for and used another app which will also be linked to convert the .png into a .icns file (the standard file type used for Apple app icons)(Since that, I noticed on their website that they claim to accept \u201call standard image file types,\u201d so I think I took the scenic route for those extra icons by installing a whole other app to convert the file). One bug I encountered after uploading my desired icons was that while the app icons changed in the launchpad, the apps in my dock stayed the same. This was easily fixed by removing and re-adding those apps to my dock. The one app I haven't been able to change is the Calendar app. From doing some research online, it seems that the Calendar app has something special about it which makes it impossible to change its icon. Regardless, I love the ability to customize the rest of my apps and give my computer a more cohesive theme.</p>\n<p>Overall, I rate IconChamps a 7/10. While it has some bugs and the process can be a bit tedious, I found the finished product to be worth the process. The shared theme in my dock really makes it look a thousand times better, and I love that IconChamp is able to change system apps on top of third-party ones. The price tag for the pro version will certainly turn some people off, but the free version is still an amazing app for anyone wanting to update some older app icons.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Notch Focus Timer</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/notch-focus-timer/id6477333821?mt=12&amp;src=AppAgg.com\">Notch Focus Timer</a></p>\n<p>One of the most simple additions to any Mac with a notch, Notch Timer is a super clean timer app that uses the Notch to display how long is left. The app is controlled through the menu bar, where, unlike Apple, you can set a timer as long as you'd like (seriously, I was able to make a time for 1,000,000,000 hours). You can also pause or stop the timer by simply dragging the mouse into the notch, which causes the timer to expand and display how long is left, and the buttons to pause or cancel. Notch Timer also allows you to toggle for different sounds to play once the timer has finished, and even change the colour of the bar wrapping around the notch to be any colour you desire. At a price of free and already on the App Store, there's no reason not to have this simple app on your Mac.</p>\n<p>Notch Focus Timer gets a 9/10. I can't think of any shortcomings in this app or any reason not to install it. The only concern I have is that I don't believe there is any way to delete a custom timer and I fear I now have a timer for 1,000,000,000 hours and no way to delete it. For what it is, it's pretty close to perfect. It's simple, it works perfectly, and it's super easy to use. Not every app needs to have 100 features, and this is a perfect example of that. Notch Timer does one thing, and it does it perfectly, so I can't ask anything more from it.</p>\n<p><strong>5. boringNotch</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://theboring.name/\">boringNotch Install</a></p>\n<p>I previously asked this subreddit which notch app was considered the best. As I anticipated, everyone had their own answer. The thing with these notch apps like Alcove, Dynamic Lake, and NotchNook, is that they all have different pros and cons, making this review a little more subjective. After doing the trial on those previously mentioned apps, I decided to try boringNotch before deciding which app to commit to. Since installing boringNotch, I have forgotten about the other 3. boringNotch is quite similar to NotchNook, but a little simpler with not as many bugs.</p>\n<p>As a bit of a newer app, boringNotch doesn't have all of the features that its competition does, but that isn't always a bad thing. The devs have a clear roadmap on their GitHub page which clearly outlines the features they have planned, and an active discord community in which they tease new features, answer community questions, and investigate bug reports. Currently, boringNotch has an integrated calendar, media player, and drop tray for files, among other things. While boringNotch doesn't currently offer a system hud replacement, it's been teased numerous times and looks to hopefully be ready for release in due course. I've come up with a temporary solution to this by using MediaMate for my system hud and boringNotch for its media player and other features. The team working on this app is passionate about their work and has a strong base and a roadmap which looks promising for the future. I haven't encountered any major bugs using boringNotch and the devs are good about looking into issues and fixing major problems in a timely manner.</p>\n<p>Considering the price, its competition, and the plans for the future, I've gone with an 8/10 for boringNotch. Sure other notch apps may have more features, but is the number of features the only thing used to decide which is better? Of course not. boringNotch is surprisingly stable for being a newer app and it's started with a really strong base. I look forward to seeing the devs continue to build off of their strong start as they work through their roadmap</p>\n<p><strong>5. Dato</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dato/id1470584107?mt=12\">Dato on the Apple App Store</a></p>\n<p>Having used Dato for a couple of years now, it's another one of those apps that I often forget isn't a part of macOS for everyone! Dato makes it easy to access your calendar and see your upcoming events by simply clicking the icon in the menu bar. It makes it super easy to check your schedule coming up without having to open the calendar app every time. It's another one of those apps that feels super seamless and having used it for over 2 years now, I can't imagine using my Mac without it. I probably use it 2-3 times A DAY because it just makes accessing your calendar so easy. It is the most expensive app on here, costing $16 USD ($23 CAD or approx 15 euros) from the App Store, but I can assure you that you will find Dato to be an absolute essential that is definitely worth the price.</p>\n<p>I'm giving Dato an 8/10. I've never encountered a bug using Dato and I'm confident to say that it will change how you use your calendar on your Mac. My only issue with Dato is the price. I fear that without a free trial, many will underestimate how amazing Dato is, and be turned away by its steep price. Furthermore, by being in the App Store instead of giving a few licence keys which could be split between a few people. Unless you are a part of Family Sharing like I was, $16 USD for one person is a high price to pay and definitely reduces the number of new users. However, those who push past the price will understand why I only docked 2 points from its rating. I promise you, the sting of the price will go away, and you will be left with a truly revolutionary app that totally changes how you use your calendar.</p>\n<p><strong>6. DockDoor</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/ejbills/DockDoor\">DockDoor Github</a></p>\n<p>Another recent installation, DockDoor makes it so much easier to manage all your windows. I usually like to keep my browser windows organized based on what I'm doing. This means I usually have 3 or 4 windows at a time for the different things I'm doing on my laptop. DockDoor will show you a preview of each window as you hover over it, making it super easy to manage and change windows. It's got a ton of customization and is another one of those apps that makes using a Mac that little bit better. I like being able to get a quick preview of what I have running on each app and I would totally recommend it for people who tend to have numerous apps and windows open at the same time. I've only had DockDoor for a little while now so I can't give the most in-depth review of it but my experience so far made it impossible to leave off of this list.</p>\n<p>Given DockDoor is free, it's another one of those apps where there's no reason not to install it and try it out. As a relatively newer app, I've encountered a few bugs which I'm sure will be fixed, but nothing that impacts your overall user experience. For these reasons, I've given DockDoor an 8/10 because I'm sure its bugs will be fixed and when that happens, you're left with a free app that makes managing your windows so much easier.</p>",

I recently shared a\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/appletv/comments/1h2qonl/was_gonna_discount_my_apple_tv_apps_for_black/\">similar\u00a0offer\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0Apple\u00a0TV\u00a0sub</a>\u00a0for several of my Apple TV apps during Black Friday and was thrilled by the overwhelming response and gratitude. It inspired me to extend the same generosity to this sub with my macOS app for Cyber Monday! As a way to express my appreciation, I\u2019m making my Mac meeting app,\u00a0<strong>MeetingMenu</strong>, completely\u00a0<strong>FREE</strong>\u00a0until midnight on December 3, UTC! No subscriptions, no catch\u2014just download and enjoy.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m the developer of MeetingMenu, a Mac app I created to solve my own meeting management headaches. Like many of you, I find myself doing lots of meetings online across various apps. I\u2019m frequently accessing the same settings and tools during meetings, and I wanted a way to keep them all in one convenient place\u2014right in the menu bar.</p>\n<p>Most important for me was being able to see my next meeting at a glance, with a countdown timer and the ability to launch it with a single click\u2014right in the menu bar. That feature alone has been a game-changer for staying organized and never missing a meeting.</p>\n<p>In addition, I wanted tools to simplify screen sharing, like quickly hiding my desktop, icons, and wallpaper to avoid any awkward moments. I also built in a privacy browser to prevent my bookmarks or history from showing during meetings.</p>\n<p>As I kept using it, I realized there were even more tools I frequently needed that were buried within the user interfaces of various meeting apps. So, I bundled them all into one app:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tools to quickly check my mic volume and see how I look on camera before meetings.</li>\n<li>A quick meeting launcher for platforms like Zoom, Teams, and Google Meet.</li>\n<li>Custom time zone views to see meeting times in different regions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other features include: sticky notes, in-meeting indicator, low power mode, WiFi signal check, audio quality test, and more\u2014all accessible from the menu bar.</p>\n<p>Yes, I know there are apps with overlapping features, but I needed something that combined everything I rely on in one place\u2014like a Swiss Army knife for meeting tools.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s how MeetingMenu came to life, and it\u2019s been a lifesaver for me. It\u2019s still relatively new, so I\u2019d really appreciate any feedback, feature suggestions, or tips to make it better for the community.</p>\n<p>\u23f3\u00a0<strong>This is a one-day offer, valid until midnight on December 3, UTC.</strong>\u00a0Must download today before it goes back to being paid.</p>\n<p>\ud83d\udc49\u00a0<a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/meetingmenu/id6538714770\">Download\u00a0MeetingMenu\u00a0for\u00a0Mac</a><br />\n\ud83d\udc49\u00a0<a href=\"https://meetingmenu.app/\">Visit\u00a0the\u00a0MeetingMenu\u00a0website</a></p>\n<p>Thanks again to this amazing community for your support\u2014you\u2019re the best!

Unless you can't. Then you have a problem. Or, maybe you are experimenting with <a href=\"https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/open-core-legacy-patcher\">Open Core Legacy Patcher</a> to install a later version of macOS on a device that doesn't officially support it. In that case, you are going to need a copy of an OS, preferably bootable, and some sort of media to copy that OS installation onto. You can do the installation through other methods, like target disk mode or various imaging applications too, but they take some know how. The other thing you can use these files for is when experimenting with virtual machines in something like Virtual Box, UTM or VMWare Fusion.</p>\n<p><strong>Mist</strong></p>\n<p>To get a copy of the firmware and OS you need, I know of no easier method than using <a href=\"https://github.com/ninxsoft/Mist?tab=readme-ov-file\">Mist</a>, a free app available on GitHub. With Mist, you can get everything from the latest beta, all the way back to Mac OS X 7.5. You can get Intel or Apple Silicon installers, or the universal installers available for macOS Big Sur and later.</p>\n<p><strong>Balena Etcher</strong></p>\n<p>If you are planning to use an SD card or a USB drive, things work better when you flash the media than when you try to fiddle with partitions and permissions on your own from the command line. Luckily, there is an app for that. It is <a href=\"https://etcher.balena.io/\">Balena Etcher</a>, a free app with built-in safeguards to keep you from erasing the wrong drive. Balena Etcher will also create bootable media for Windows and various Linux builds too.</p>",

I\u2019ve just published my second macOS app, which detects when the last window of an app is closed and quits that app. This helps prevent unnecessary memory usage by apps that are not actively being used. While macOS does have built-in memory management, I\u2019ve encountered situations where the system runs out of memory without closing inactive apps. I created this app to ensure all apps without open windows are closed. The app is free\u2014hope you enjoy it, and feel free to share any feedback. Cheers.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://lawand.io/last-window-quits/\">https://lawand.io/last-window-quits/</a></p>",

Absolutely irreplaceable.</p>\n<p><strong>2.  RayCast:</strong><br />\nI tried RayCast twice for 1-2 days, wasn't sure how to use it, then I tried it again by going all-in and replacing Spotlight keyboard shortcut with Raycast and man, I'm in live with it more and more everyday! This is an absolutely must-have for developers and normal users alike.</p>\n<p>Their Clipboard history with option to search in Images (OCR) works amazingly and is very snappy.</p>\n<p>It can do wonderful stuff including so many calculations (days to, since specific date, modifying text, Quick snippets to quickly fill tons of texts, replaces MacOS's native Text Replacement much better by allowing to to have multi-line replacements and so much more)</p>\n<p>You can do everything with a keyboard shortcut including making windows full-screen, maximizing, minimizing, specific sizes (left half, first third-half and so much more)|  </p>\n<p><strong>3.  Shottr:</strong><br />\nA wonderful, super-lightweight Screenshot tool, can do a lot more than MacOS' native screenshot tool and works like a charm. You can now add 'backdrop', gradient style backgrounds to screenshots too, the popular style for code and other screenshots these days, and is super super fast!  </p>\n<p>MonitorControl and Lunar:<br />\nThese are both great for managing brightness of your external monitors using keyboard shortcuts, a must have if you use external monitor regularly.  </p>\n<p><strong>4.  Rectangle:</strong><br />\nThis is my Window manager of choice, both free and Pro versions are great. A lot more feature than MacOS' built-in windows manager (that was released just recently in Sequoia) and works amazing with RayCast support.</p>\n<p><strong>5.  ChatGPT:</strong><br />\nChatGPT's Mac native app is amazing! The quickbar works great and it is not possible to live without it. Much easier access compared to the web-version.  </p>\n<p>What are yours?</p>",

The Wispr Team deactivated my Slack account on their workspace after asking polite and totally fair questions there in my mind. Super shady inner workings in this app in my opinion. And a red flag how they treat their users. Definitely did not feel right from the start. (I used it for about a month).</p>\n<p>My post on Slack before they banned me on their Slack (oh and I also said that I was going to uninstall because I realized after removing it from login items, because I was done with it for a while, only to realize THAT IT WILL INJECT ITSELF INTO YOUR LOGIN ITEMS AGAIN SOMEHOW ON LOGIN.</p>\n<p>\"Hey Wispr team,</p>\n<p>I've been using Flow for a while now, and I've got to say, the functionality is impressive. However, I have several concerns:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>System Integration:\nThe app for some reason ruins my right-click context menu in Firefox. Extension options in right-click context menus disappear on hover. I spent hours troubleshooting, even ended up nuking my Firefox setup, only to find out Flow was the culprit. What is it doing in Firefox anyway?\nSuddenly, I'm seeing the Wispr Flow logo in my Chrome address bar. I don't remember enabling this, and there seems to be no way to turn this off?\nThe app adds itself to login items every time it's launched. This is not standard behavior and feels intrusive.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Resource Usage:\nThe app is a whopping 800MB, which feels kind of big for a dictation tool?\nIt's constantly using about 8% CPU, even when idle. What's it doing in the background?\nLaunch time is around 10 seconds with quirky loading messages. What's really happening during this \"setup\"?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Deep Integration and Privacy Concerns:\nThe onboarding checklist actually tracks actions across apps. It knew when I used Discord, ChatGPT, mail and other apps which I don't remember 100%. This level of system awareness is alarming.\nYour promo video shows the app using context to correctly spell unusual names in emails. How exactly is this context gathered? Does it capture my screen or what?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Transparency Issues:\nYour privacy policy is vague and broad. It doesn't provide clear limits on data use or specific explanations of what data is collected in different scenarios.\nThe policy mentions using customer content to train AI models. Does this include my dictations and the context you gather?\nThere's no clear documentation about the app's system interactions or the full extent of its capabilities.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Browser Integration:\nThe Chrome and Firefox integrations appeared without clear user consent or easy ways to disable them.\nWhat exactly are these browser integrations doing? Are they monitoring my web activity?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Data Collection and Usage:\nGiven the app's deep integration and context awareness, what exactly are you collecting?\nHow is this data being used beyond the immediate dictation functionality?\nAre you sharing this data with third parties? If so, with whom and for what purposes?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>User Control:\nThere seems to be a lack of granular controls for the app's various integrations and features.\nHow can users opt out of specific data collection or feature integrations?\nHow can users opt out of injections into certain apps? Shouldn't it be opt-in?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Security Concerns:\nWith such deep system access, what security measures are in place to protect user data?\nHow are you safeguarding against potential misuse of the app's extensive permissions?</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Don't get me wrong - the core functionality of Flow is impressive. The dictation accuracy, speed, and cross-app functionality are genuinely useful. But right now, using Flow feels like I've given an unknown entity unfettered access to my digital life. Given these concerns, I'm hesitant about becoming a paid subscriber.</p>\n<p>We need some real transparency here:\n1. Can you provide a detailed, technical explanation of Flow's system access and integration methods?\n2. What specific data are you collecting, and how exactly is it being used and protected?\n3. Can we get more granular user controls over the app's various features and integrations?\n4. Are there plans to optimize the app's resource usage and size?\n5. How are you ensuring user privacy and security given the app's deep system access?</p>\n<p>I want to continue using Flow, but I need to fully understand what I'm permitting on my system. Looking forward to your detailed response.\"</p>\n<p>I've got some email correspondence with them and I had more questions in the Slack which went unanswered.</p>",

I\u2019ve been hunting for some new productivity apps for my Mac, and after a bit of experimenting, I found some lesser-known gems that really helped me streamline my work. These apps are on the rise and definitely worth checking out:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Flow by Wispr</strong>: If you\u2019ve got a lot of ideas but not enough time to type them all out, Flow is a great voice-to-text app. It\u2019s not just about dictation\u2014it actually personalizes your written word to match your natural style. I\u2019ve found it super helpful when I\u2019m multitasking or trying to capture ideas on the fly.</li>\n<li><strong>Raycast</strong>: Similar to Alfred but sleeker and faster. It\u2019s a productivity launcher that lets you manage apps, scripts, and even GitHub or Slack right from your keyboard. It\u2019s perfect if you love hotkeys and avoiding the mouse altogether.</li>\n<li><strong>TickTick</strong>: A to-do list app that comes with an integrated Pomodoro timer and habit tracker. It\u2019s been my go-to for managing tasks and staying focused on one thing at a time. Plus, it\u2019s flexible enough for both work and personal use.</li>\n<li><strong>Superhuman</strong>: For anyone who deals with a flood of emails, this one\u2019s a game-changer. It\u2019s an email app that focuses on speed and minimalism, helping you get through your inbox faster than ever. Super helpful for cutting through the clutter!</li>\n<li><strong>Loom</strong>: Loom\u2019s a video messaging tool, but it\u2019s perfect for sending quick updates or feedback without typing long emails. I use it to create short video walk-throughs for my team, and it saves so much time compared to typing everything out.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Lemme know if you've tried knew stuff that stuck!</p>",

You can throw just about any type of video file at it and VLC will play it. Whenever someone tries to use something else and runs into a problem, I generally won't help them unless they try to use VLC first. So, you can imagine that I was rather dubious when I first encountered <a href=\"https://iina.io/\">IINA</a>, a free and open-source video and audio player. I do have to admit that it is way better looking. VLC is still rocking that Windows XP vibe and IINA has a sleek, post-Yosemite native macOS design aesthetic. It is lovely to look at. When I looked into it, I found that it is a front end for two rock solid CLI video platforms ff-mpeg and mpv. It can play just about anything VLC can play.</p>\n<h1>Other IINA Features</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>IINA is easy to customize. You can control playback speed, video rotation, aspect ratio adjustment, deinterlacing, and more.</li>\n<li>IINA plays online videos easily through URL support</li>\n<li>It has very strong sub-title support with built in search, language choice (be sure to set a default language in settings), size and adjustable timing</li>\n<li>Although it doesn't do editing, it can serve as a QuickTime replacement for playback</li>\n<li>Gesture control using a trackpad or Magic Mouse for most program features</li>\n<li>Supports picture in picture mode for multi-tasking</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can get IINA on <a href=\"https://iina.io/\">the project's website</a> or on <a href=\"https://github.com/iina/iina\">GitHub</a>.</p>",

I've been using it for over 3 months and was a beta tester for it. The app is supposed to launch really soon and it's going to become paid, I think. Just sending it across to let you know that it\u2019s finally open to download directly from the website now.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Wispr Flow.</strong> It\u2019s a speech to text tool that understands you, it\u2019s like having a personal assistant who reads your mind. I\u2019m Indian so most names I say are \u201ccomplicated\u201d but this tool gets it. And you wont get a blob of text that you\u2019ll need to fix, you\u2019ll receive a well formatted document. I generally use it for emails, texting and essays but it works in any text box out there so give it a whirl (its free rn)</p>\n<p>It adapts to your writing style, gets your names right, and fixes your grammar. It also knows over 100 languages which is pretty cool because that's the best use case for me, if I have to text people who don't understand English I can just ask it to convert it to my mother tongue at the end of the sentence and it does that which has made communication so much easier.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In terms of productivity, I think my favourite use is just answering emails using this and just using it on Slack because it's just that much faster and because it structures it into paragraphs and bullet points I don't even need to worry about it I just hit send right away. Gives me a bunch of time. The convenience of it helps me not get too tired, and I feel I'm a better communicator because I'm not stingy with my words because keyboards used to be so annoying to type (each word) but now I can just ramble on (this post has been written by flow, so expect it to be long).</p>\n<p>To top it all off, I am a writer, a hobbyist in fact at this point because can't pursue it professionally just yet. However, this tool was kind of a godsend.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I never thought that I would be using speech for long form writing and I was even very confused about it. But I just feel so relieved. There is no overwhelming feeling before I actually get to writing now. It's just a freeing feeling knowing that it's going to be convenient and that is why I don't even procrastinate too much. I feel like it's just a way to trick my brain into actually working since the physical effort is practically wiped out and there is such a low edit rate. It's personalized to how I write because there's tone match there that I never have to really edit proper nouns or anything when I'm writing it. And any fictitious names that I come up with for my writing, I can just add it to the dictionary so it gets it right every time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I've had the best time using it. It's just become an integral part of my work. And while I would hope for it to be free forever, they're launching it on 30th, which means that after that, there's going to be a freemium version. So anyone, students, professionals, whoever feels like this is something that could help take even a little bit of anxiety off your head, do it because work's not getting any shorter and our life's not getting any longer :)</p>",

Hint: You can ask all those AIs to format their output in OPML for easier pasting into Power Node</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<ul>\n<li>A few bugfixes</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I'd be thrilled to hear any feedback, feature requests, etc.! And if you like the app (or don't) you can leave a review/rating but please be honest :)</p>\n<p><em>Info: This promo runs until this post is 24 hours old. Then I'll change the price back.</em></p>",

Future plans to make a dedicated macOS app. More details at the bottom.</em></p>\n<p>I\u2019m excited to share that I have recently created not just a dictionary app, but an entire dictionary from the ground up. It\u2019s completely free without ads. I call it\u00a0<a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lngo-the-peoples-dictionary/id6596728974\">Lngo: The People's Dictionary</a>.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Why did I do this?</strong>\u00a0I have a profound love for language, and I was continually frustrated with cancer-level ads on other dictionary apps, and the extortion of subscription fees. The free app alternatives often had outdated definitions, clunky designs, and missing features like saving or syncing words.</p>\n<p>I know a dedicated dictionary app might not be for everyone. Many people use a browser or iPhone\u2019s Spotlight search. This app is tailored for those who love diving deep into word definitions, exploring etymology, and actively trying to expand their vocabulary by saving words for future study and review.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I teamed up with a small group of software engineers and those with backgrounds in linguistics, to build this app. We all shared the same grievance with the lackluster dictionary options available on the Apple ecosystem. So we sifted through open-source dictionaries, cleaned up the clutter, removed duplicates, used AI to revise, and manually reviewed as many definitions as possible.</p>\n<p><strong>Here\u2019s what makes this app stand out:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>250,000+ unique words</li>\n<li>Fully offline access</li>\n<li>The most comprehensive synonym and antonym search found on any app or website</li>\n<li>In-depth etymology and word history</li>\n<li>Multi-platform compatibility for iPhone, iPad, and Mac (Apple silicon only)</li>\n<li>iCloud sync for your saved words across all devices</li>\n<li>Integrated flashcard system for studying</li>\n<li>Specialized vocabulary sections for ACT, SAT, and GRE preparation that provide exposure to new words</li>\n<li>Modern user interface utilizing the full capabilities of SwiftUI</li>\n<li>Includes slang and curse words</li>\n<li>IPA pronunciation</li>\n<li>Export options (e.g., load saved words into Anki)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>A quick comparison of other English dictionary apps:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wordbook-universal/id364030280\">WordBook</a>: Great app and my previous go-to, but it lacks a Mac version, flashcards, and word antonyms. That was a dealbreaker for me.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lookup-dictionary-learn-daily/id872564448\">LookUp</a>: A beautifully designed app, but requires a subscription and doesn\u2019t sync saved words across devices. Also lacks offline access and rich synonyms/antonyms.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wordweb-dictionary/id309627313\">WordWeb</a>: Basic definitions with no antonyms, no sync, and no Mac version.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dictionary/id379450383\">The Free Dictionary</a>: Outdated interface and no Mac app.</p>\n<p>Merriam-Webster,\u00a0<a href=\"http://dictionary.com/\">Dictionary.com</a>, Oxford: Quality definitions, but the ads are insane, and the subscription fees are equally ridiculous. Additionally, they all require online access, and they don\u2019t have Mac apps for syncing favorites.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Please use the app and enjoy! If you find it helpful, I'd appreciate it if you could leave a review and help spread the word. :)</strong></p>\n<p><em>*I do want to point out that I specifically optimized this app to be used on Macs. My purpose for creating one app version for all three platforms (iOS, iPadOS, macOS) was so that I can maintain one codebase and still distribute to the 3 platforms. Yet, within the Swift code itself I am performing checks to verify when the app is running on iOS, iPadOs, or macOS, so that I can perform actions and behaviors to best suit the device running it.</em>\u00a0</p>",

For some context, I was onboarded as an early beta user for this app and I have been a huge fan since the very beginning. As they're gearing up for a launch, I just wanted to share this app before it becomes paid to anyone who wants to use it (currently it's free). It's this really cool voice dictation tool that is unlike others because:</p>\n<p>It has a very very low latency.</p>\n<p>It structures your writing. So, if you're writing a blob of text, it's going to make it into well-formatted text (be it bullet points or paragraphs).</p>\n<p>It understands different languages. So, if I'm talking in say Spanish, and I ask it to translate it to English after finishing, it's going to convert it to that. It also fixes your grammar, making work go by a lot faster.</p>\n<p>I use it for a lot of my work simply to organize meetings. Realized that a lot of my friends who also ended up picking up the app said was it just makes you a lot more productive and efficient because when you don't have to stress about writing or typing, you're not as stingy with your words, which means you can explain and define things better. And in that you also communicate properly, which means work gets done faster.</p>\n<p>Don't know when the launch is, but I think it's going to happen in the next 1-2 months. Because they've been sending a lot of user interviews for it. But yeah, Now is a good time to download if you are looking to save a bunch of hours every day AND I like it because of the convenience of it all. I think there's a waitlist but they usually gets you off the waitlist in under a day.</p>\n<p>here's the link: <a href=\"https://www.flowvoice.ai\">https://www.flowvoice.ai</a></p>",

I reenabled the notch on my MacBook, which I had turned off with Better Monitor. The installation was straightforward, requiring access to the camera, microphone and Apple Events.  </p>\n<p>NotchNook has two feature areas, the nook and the file tray. The nook is where the widgets are located. The currently supported widgets are media controls, shortcuts, calendar and mirror. There is a placeholder for notes, but it is not currently active. The media control widget offered to start Apple Music or YouTube. Once I opened Apple Music, the controls were no different than what is already available in Control Center with the exception of being able to use gestures to move between songs. You can add two shortcuts to the nook, but they do not support drag and drop nor do they act on files selected in the Finder rendering the usefulness limited.The calendar displays the current day and two days prior and after that. There is no way to choose a default calendar and when I added events to my system default calendar, they did not appear. The mirror widget displays an image from your built-in camera that is the literal size of a postage stamp with no way to enlarge it. I did not find it useful.  </p>\n<p>The second feature area is the file tray. It serves as a place to drag and keep files. Once you have a file there, there are no options to perform other actions, like compression or moving to cloud storage apps or any kind of image modification actions. It is strictly a holding area. There is a place holder that states additional file actions are coming, but as of now, they do not exist.  </p>\n<p>Because of the lack of depth on the features, I do not recommend purchasing this app right now. <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dropover-easier-drag-drop/id1355679052?mt=12a\">Dropover</a>, $5.99 app provides a huge variety of file actions. You can use Control Center for media control and add shortcuts to your dock or menu bar natively. If you still want to try Notch Nook, you can get it <a href=\"https://lo.cafe/notchnook\">on the developer's website.</a> Currently you can get a %35 discount if you tweet about the app.</p><div><br></div><img src=\"https://i.redd.it/0us93c17wlgd1.jpeg\" />",

You can install if by <a href=\"https://github.com/ejbills/DockDoor\">downloading it from GitHub</a> or through Homebrew. Once you have it installed and running with the proper permissions, you will see a pop-up preview of the apps window (or windows) when you hover over the app in the dock, regardless of where you place the dock in your workspace. I have mine on the left side of the screen.</p>\n<p>If you choose to use it, the included window switcher moves between open Windows (not just between apps like the macOS default). I already use an app for window switching (Alt+Tab) and have it configured with shortcuts I like so I turned off this functionality in DockDoor.</p>\n<p>When you activate DockDoor from the dock, four traffic light buttons appear in the window pop-up, each with a different function.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\ud83d\udfe3 Quit the window's app. You can hold the Option (\u2325) key while clicking to f<strong>orce</strong> quit.</li>\n<li>\ud83d\udd34 Close the window</li>\n<li>\ud83d\udfe1 Minimize the window</li>\n<li>\ud83d\udfe2 Enter the window to full screen</li>\n</ul>\n<p>DockDoor is highly customizable as seen in the preference windows below.</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/e7ndcksttudd1.jpg?width=1650&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f8f81ad775e165c4fb3b8a23aaab54b8c5cf903b</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/6or65urwtudd1.jpg?width=1656&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2eca6c731c5f4ca3549280ee53e148e2beb88c50</p>",

Your feedback and support means a lot.</p>\n<p>LookAway 1.6.0 is now released and here's what's new:</p>\n<h1>Work Schedule</h1>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/32cgsk8psocd1.png?width=1317&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e562500cd5ba245abc65b48ca5108c942e167b7</p>\n<p>Setting a work schedule in LookAway has been the most requested feature since the launch. You can now set a schedule and LookAway will only suggest breaks during those hours.</p>\n<h1>Custom Durations</h1>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/36k6gwtysocd1.png?width=1339&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f00b8ea6271445339f40e904263c0e7c095ca20</p>\n<p>You can now set custom durations for everything in the settings - including the idle time thresholds.</p>\n<h1>And more...</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>LookAway now correctly detects any new cameras or mics that are connected while LookAway is already running. This makes the meeting detection even better.  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Long break cycle is now reset when you cross your idle time reset threshold instead of focus time.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Thank you!</h1>\n<p>Also, I am offering a 40% discount on all license options for a limited time. You can use the code MACAPPS40OFF at checkout to get a discount. The code will expire after 48 hours.</p>\n<p>And that's all! Thanks for reading, and helping me make LookAway better everyday. Please keep your feedback coming - it helps a lot!</p>",
