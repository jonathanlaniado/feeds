The app does support Celsius, Fahrenheit, 12/24 hour time format and you can make the dynamic gradients based on the weather just a single colour for accessibility.

The idea was to build something that could capture and index digital activity, making it easy to remember and find information later.</p>\n<p>After months of hard work, I finally got Recall to a point where it was working well. I've managed to ask him for information on my activity  from a week ago with details and all that locally with local llms! It was exciting to see it come together and actually do what I hoped it would.</p>\n<p>But then, I found out yesterday that the new Copilot+ laptops have a feature called \"Recall\" that does pretty much the same thing but better. It was a bit of a shock. Here I was, thinking I had something unique, only to see it already out there in a big way.</p>\n<p>So, now I'm not sure what to think. Instead of giving up, I decided to open-source Recall and rename it reMind. I believe that by sharing it, maybe some of you might have ideas or want to help improve it. If you\u2019re interested, I\u2019d love to hear from you!</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s the GitHub link: <a href=\"https://github.com/DonTizi/ReMind/\">Github Repo</a></p>\n<p>Best,</p>",

For more information, here's our <a href=\"https://discord.gg/8aA7JRkEmQ\">discord</a>.</p>\n<p>Mythic is the best and easiest way to sort all of your games in one place, whether those games are Windows or macOS-based.  It comes with <strong>epic games support</strong> right out of the box (and <strong>steam support in the future</strong>), but if that doesn't quite meet your needs, you can always <strong>manually import</strong> your games into the launcher.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/vieav1ccca1d1.png?width=2302&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e69d2a37016c643e95d35d2499337aef517711b\">A screenshot of Mythic doing its thing!

When I'm in the toilet, I found my app at number 5 ranking on the App Store (Productivity), and I was shocked. But I thought, how is that possible? Is it a bug!? So, I went to App Store Connect and found that it shows 'Not Enough Data' I have to wait until the data is available. </p>\n<p>No matter what the outcome, I'm okay with launching my app. It's alright for me, even if things don't turn out as expected. </p>\n<p>It's an all-in-one note-taking app that allows you to store a variety of notes in one place, including Events, Reminders, Notes, Journals, Timers, Stopwatches, Logs, and Bookmarks. All saved as files. No need for a server and you can have as many files as you want. And you can put the files on iCloud Drive to sync your data across all your Apple devices, your notes are always accessible. </p>\n<p>I've made it a one-time purchase because I believe in fair pricing and transparency. I've funded this app entirely on my own, without any VC backing, and I'm committed to never collecting and selling your data.</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/qlfqqfdqcz0d1.jpg?width=563&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba1274eb7eb766061eac8b0d20994930d8e90ae5</p>\n<p>There are many more features to come and plenty of room fr improvement.

This will help you beat those questions to the punch and will show that you've done some amount of market research first. </p>\n<p>Also, please be careful with subscriptions; I understand that app development is costly and subscriptions are the new hotness, but on this subreddit, we are weary of subscriptions for many reasons. If your model can allow for it, always try to consider the POV of someone who'd like a one-time purchase. I understand this can get tricky with the ever-popular AI wrappers. Suggestion? If your app is bundling API access into its monthly cost, try to investigate whether a BYOK (bring your own API key) is an option. </p>\n<p>This is just friendly advice from someone who loves to try new apps. Keep building, and keep coming up with new stuff, I love seeing it!</p>",

I\u2019m trying to figure out what app I can use to make a Photo Album/Collage that I can print by myself on a US Letter Paper. The apps I see when I search the Mac AppStore redirects to third party printing services that deliver the finished product to you.</p>\n<p>Previously when I was using MS Office on Windows, it was easy since all I had to do was use the Insert-Photo Album option and I can select how many photos per page I need. This was available on Word and PowerPoint. I didn\u2019t know this option was never available for Office on Mac, until I tried to find the feature for a document I\u2019m working on.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s the Media-Image Gallery route with Pages but it puts all photos (and can caption it) in one page that you have to flip one by one but it only prints the Photo on the foreground of the gallery. I know I can drag drop those photos into Office or Pages but we\u2019re looking at close to a thousand photos that I have to format and caption so anything that can make the job easy would help.</p>\n<p>I appreciate any recommendations, Paid or Free. Thanks!</p>",

I'd love to hear your thoughts and feedback on it, as your input means the world to me \ud83d\ude0a.</p>\n<p>So, let me give you a quick rundown of what the app does: It allows you to create custom folder icons by selecting your preferred color and optionally, an icon to accompany it. Once you've made your selections and hit the generate button, the app creates an image that you can use to replace any folder icon on your device. Pretty neat, right?</p>\n<p>I'm really excited about this project and can't wait to hear what you all think!

You had to download it from a website, and many of them suddenly stopped working over the years.</p>\n<p>You would also see the confusing workflow charts of each workflow and understand where you need to add the hotkey or when to update it.</p>\n<p>But with Raycast, I installed all my favorite extensions from the Raycast command line within minutes.</p>\n<p>The extension table clearly shows how to set up hotkeys and aliases for every action.</p>\n<p>Setting it up was a fun and easy experience.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><strong>New Features</strong></p>\n<p>Here are some of the new extensions I\u2019ve installed that I didn\u2019t find on Alfred:</p>\n<p>My Schedule: Raycast connects to my calendar and gives me a quick rundown of my events.</p>\n<p>Smart Converter / Calculator: this feature can perform all the basic calculator tasks but also tell you the date \u201c5 months from now\u201d and how much are 50 dollars in euros. Very handy.</p>\n<p>AirPods connector: Alfred has one, but it broke for me several times, and I couldn\u2019t get it to work. Raycast\u2019s one works seamlessly. I can connect my AirPods by typing Command+P.</p>\n<p>Translate: Alfred's \u201ctranslate\u201d workflow sends you to the web. Raycast one translates everything within the app itself.</p>\n<p>Floating Notes: show and hide cool-looking sticky notes.</p>\n<p>Raycast also offers AI capabilities for those willing to pay for the \u201cPro\u201d subscription, but I haven\u2019t tried it yet.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>(P.s my full post is <a href=\"https://simplyproductive.substack.com/p/why-im-switching-from-alfred-to-raycast\">here</a>)</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>What do you think?

I also do some checking to see whether the app is shady (though I am by no means a security expert so most of this is low-level checks, and by reading reviews etc.). You should do your own due diligence and check the app and its source. I can help with troubleshooting but you should always know and understand what you're installing on your machine!</p>\n<h1>Your suggestions</h1>\n<p>In the past I have said suggestions should be put in the comments here, but I think a better process will be the use of Issues on GitHub. If you don't have GitHub, feel free to comment, and I will make issues for you and reply to you with them. The GitHub is here</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>GitHub</strong> - <a href=\"https://github.com/jamesjingyi/free-mac-apps\">Free Mac Apps</a>   </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/jamesjingyi/free-mac-apps\">^(https://github.com/jamesjingyi/free-mac-apps)</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'm doing this for the following reasons: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>It's much easier for me to manage (lists where I can cross things off are good, and give me endorphins!)</li>\n<li>It'll reduce people recommending the same thing, rather people can 'second' recommendations in GitHub (it's hard to scroll through lots of Reddit comments, especially if you find this post later!)</li>\n<li>I would like to encourage discussion based on other people's experiences, not just my testing, so having them here will allow people to discuss alternatives, issues, etc</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If anyone has any recommendations about a better solution, please let me know! At the moment I am retaining the only editing control of the Google Sheet, but this might change in the future, and of course you can make a copy and use it yourself - I am not precious about any of this stuff, I just want people to know about them!</p>\n<h1>What about the Master Lists?</h1>\n<p>This by no means replaces (or is meant to replace) the excellent work done on the Master Lists in the /r/macapps subreddit. Those provide excellent and well thought out comparisons, they just don't focus on free/open source, which is why my list differs slightly. </p>\n<p>If you are looking for the best app, you should definitely look there - I don't really provide that many alternatives, as I find a solution and recommend that. You may also be willing to pay for certain things (I certainly pay for certain software because it is better or not available for free), and my list will not cover those.</p>\n<p>The Master Lists are here:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Reddit</strong> - <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/macapps/comments/18kpzy5/master_list_of_definitive_app_comparisons_view/\">Master List of Definitive App Comparisons - View and Contribute - 2024 Update</a>  </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/macapps/comments/18kpzy5/master_list_of_definitive_app_comparisons_view/\">^(https://www.reddit.com/r/macapps/comments/18kpzy5/master_list_of_definitive_app_comparisons_view/)</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>Happy installing!</p>",

I know there is still a lot of room for improvement, but it has definitely become more stable over time.</p>\n<p>Picview is a simple image viewer that supports opening photos with a double click, then using arrow keys to flip through images or scrolling with your mouse wheel to zoom. The user experience has a very Windows-like feel and makes viewing photos more convenient than the native options.</p>\n<p>It supports over 30 file formats including PNG, JPG, WEBP and CR3. Viewing features include automatically scrolling long images into view and providing features like image slideshows, fullscreen immersive viewing.</p>\n<p>Picview is free to download and use from the App Store. Users can access all of Picview's features without limits, except they will be prompted to purchase after reaching a daily usage amount. Of course, you can choose not to buy and continue using.</p>\n<p>Recently, I increased the one-time purchase price of Picview from $2 to $5. I'm not sure if this was the right decision.</p>\n<p>If you have some time and want to spend a relaxing moment enjoying photo memories, you can try out Picview and leave some feedback.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/picview-image-viewer/id6452016140\">https://apps.apple.com/us/app/picview-image-viewer/id6452016140</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://enpicview.chitaner.com\">https://enpicview.chitaner.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/vz45hjssx5gc1.jpg?width=1500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3fbe5b2475a25cf317c702b070c452684e05ca2f\">mouse zoom</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/nitz1c4xx5gc1.jpg?width=1500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33ae5fe533028b10e00377d860247b4e06d6f163\">mouse page</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/gpkbaxc0y5gc1.jpg?width=1500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d8cf2fda021cd2bf12e881190ea6f42288c6bb13\">Long image</a></p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>",

It's an app designed for effortless note-taking, resembling a chat interface to build a personal timeline. It offers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Chronological, chat-like note entry.</li>\n<li>Tagging for organization.</li>\n<li>Global shortcuts for quick access.</li>\n<li>A native Mac app look and feel.</li>\n<li>Encrypted iCloud backup &amp; synchronization.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Developing Strflow has been a fulfilling journey. There are more features I want to add, but I am satisfied with its current state. If you're interested, please visit the website, try the app, and share your thoughts!</p>\n<p>Strflow is free for unlimited notes, tags, and attachments. The Strflow Plus plan, offering encrypted iCloud backup &amp; synchronization, is available for $0.99/month or $9.99/year as a special introductory offer. This rate will be honored for subscribers who join now, as long as their subscription is continuous.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://strflow.app\">Web Site</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/strflow-notes-journal/id6468486339?l=en-US&amp;mt=12\">Mac App Store</a></p>\n<p>PS: Currently working on developing an iOS version of Strflow\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udcbb</p>",

It communicates with your router, and uses ICMP ping and traceroute to visualize your connectivity to the Internet, and show you potential bottlenecks and issues. It is highly configurable and supports industry standard SNMP and UPnP for querying routers, servers, Macs and more. Each monitor can be configured to show real-time or historical information, and output can be written to a CSV file later parsing if you wish.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/audfl7wtiv9c1.png?width=1492&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7cd6b0fd0cedfb920afd24ef4ebd2d6123ac7915\">PeakHour's Internet Dashboard, showing a real-time view of latency and throughput.</a></p>\n<p>Some key new features of PeakHour 5:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Internet Dashboard</strong>: This new feature offers a single, comprehensive view of your internet connection's health, including local, ISP, and overall internet latency.</li>\n<li><strong>Multi-Host Latency Monitoring</strong>: Now, you can monitor latency between any two internet points, like your ISP and Google, for a better understanding of connection quality and latency.</li>\n<li><strong>Local Interface Monitoring</strong>: Monitor your Mac's network interfaces directly, without additional tool\u200bs.</li>\n<li><strong>More flexible window layout</strong>: More flexibility in arranging monitors, especially useful with multiple monitor\u200bs.</li>\n<li><strong>MacOS Sonoma Compatibility</strong>: Fully updated UI to match the latest macOS advancement\u200bs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And there's more \u2013 improved ping accuracy, horizontal scroll lock, streamlined First Time Setup and lots more.</p>\n<p>You can grab it now exclusively in the Mac Appstor\u200be.

As a macOS user, I've always wanted a powerful solution to block ads and trackers across browsers, desktop applications, and the OS itself. All of the existing solutions are either paid or offered via a freemium model, which motivated me to create Zen.</p>\n<p><strong>What Makes Zen Unique</strong>: Zen operates system-wide, intercepting network requests from all applications. It efficiently blocks ads, tracking scripts, malware, and other unwanted content that traditional browser extensions might miss. This includes trackers in desktop apps and system components. Zen works across multiple platforms, is free and will always offer full functionality without additional payments.</p>\n<p>Zen is primarily licensed under the MIT License, with some components under different terms. To learn more about Zen and how it can help protect your digital privacy, visit our GitHub page: <a href=\"https://github.com/anfragment/zen\">Zen on GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p>Looking forward to your feedback to make Zen even better!</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/1hetedf8xb4c1.png?width=994&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=380896f8da94dcf229e89991af492e482299f716</p>",

Double-click to open an image, use left and right arrow keys to navigate, and scroll the mouse wheel to zoom in and out.\n- Clean and minimalistic design. Only necessary elements are displayed, without any unnecessary distractions.\n- <strong>Supports a wide range of image formats</strong>, including PNG, JPG, WEBP, BMP, ICO, GIF, CR2, CR3, NEF, HEIC, and more.\n- <strong>Offers various image viewing modes</strong>, including single-window and multiple-window viewing. Supports eight scaling modes, such as screen-fit, window-fit, actual size and so on.\n- <strong>Highly responsive, providing smooth image browsing and fast loading</strong>. Written in native Swift, with a small installation package size of only <strong>7.1MB</strong>.\n- User-friendly, with a rich set of keyboard shortcuts. It also supports image pinned and <strong>LiveText</strong>.</p>\n<p>Picview addresses the need for a Windows Photos-like image viewing experience on macOS. It can be downloaded for free from the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/picview-image-photo-browser/id6452016140?mt=12?mt=12\">App Store</a></p>\n<p>For more information, you can visit our <a href=\"https://enpicview.chitaner.com\">official website</a></p>\n<p>We would greatly appreciate it if you could provide us with your feedback and suggestions.</p>",

Simpler than Anki, and it allows for very easy import and export</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://menubarx.app/\">MenubarX</a> (free/$5) - A handy app that allows you to pin websites to your menubar.

It's strength is its simplicity and doesn't bombard you with necessary features</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Pyroh/Fluor\">Flour</a> (free) - A simple app that changes functionality of the Fn keys depending on the open app</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://doomlaser.com/cursorcerer-hide-your-cursor-at-will/\">Cursorcerer</a> (free) - Allows you to hide your cursor with a hotkey.

In the past seven days, there have been over 1,000 users, and in the last 28 days, approximately 2,000 people have used Wins.</p>\n<p>I feel incredibly honored that Wins has been able to help you, and I am sincerely grateful for your support in my independent development journey.</p>\n<h1>About Development Status</h1>\n<p>During the year, I received a lot of feedback and suggestions, coupled with my understanding of Apple's product philosophy, I want to make something wonderful to bring to the macOS X, so I've added some features that I think are cool in the past year\uff0csuch as :</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Dock Window Preview</strong>. Now you can directly preview all windows of an app you opened</li>\n</ol>\n<p>https://reddit.com/link/17ywznm/video/d2kgpg331b1c1/player</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Shake window to hide other windows</strong>. Drag a window, give it a shake, and all other windows will be hidden</li>\n</ol>\n<p>https://reddit.com/link/17ywznm/video/lx2e44y41b1c1/player</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Hide other windows with shortcut key</strong> You can also achieve it\ud83d\udc46 using keyboard shortcuts</li>\n</ol>\n<p>https://reddit.com/link/17ywznm/video/9fnidor51b1c1/player</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Move to another display</strong>. Quickly move the window to another monitor</li>\n</ol>\n<p>https://reddit.com/link/17ywznm/video/w0a8pei61b1c1/player</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Hide All Windows</strong>. One shortcut to hide all windows, and the world becomes clean</li>\n</ol>\n<p>https://reddit.com/link/17ywznm/video/hwnuat771b1c1/player</p>\n<p>I'm a bit of a perfectionist, trying to make the product as perfect and clean as possible, and obviously Wins isn't perfect enough.</p>\n<p>I still have a lot of features in mind, such as pin a window puts it at the frontest and support for users to add theirs custom layout to the Floating Split Window and set shortcuts separately and more</p>\n<h1>In the end</h1>\n<p>I'm not a famous developer, I don't have much of audiences, I don't know how to market or promote, I just an Apple fan who loves the macOS.</p>\n<p>it wasn't an easy year for Wins, But luckily it's alive. I'm alive haha</p>\n<p>I currently have a job, but initially, I thought Wins could sustain itself through independent development. However, I later realized that the timing might not be right yet. But I believe that as long as I continue to polish Wins and make it better, it will be able to independently support me in continuously developing new features.</p>\n<p>Finally, I almost forgot to mention the most important thing! Haha</p>\n<p>\ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wins.cool/\">Wins</a> is offering a 50% discount with code <strong>BLACKFRIDAY_2023</strong> during Black Friday.</p>\n<p>If you like it and want to support independent development(thanks a lot), or if you haven't tried Wins yet, I hope you give it a try\ud83e\udef6.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Love you all guys\\~</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>",

I'm fairly new to Swift so I'm still learning, if you find any issues or have feature requests, feel free to submit in the repo.</p>\n<p>It's a fully open-source app cleaner, inspired by Freemacsoft's AppCleaner and Sun Knudsen's privacy guide's post on their open source app-cleaner script. It searches the drive for leftover files as good as it can based on a combination of app name and bundle id. It also has a file monitor that you can optionally enable which will pop up the app if you trash an application, suggesting remaining files to also delete.</p>\n<p>Note: Since I don't have a paid developer account, I don't notarize the app so you might have to right click + open the first time if it shows untrusted. Feel free to look over the code before downloading if you're not comfortable with that.</p>\n<p>Main Repo: <a href=\"https://github.com/alienator88/Pearcleaner\">https://github.com/alienator88/Pearcleaner</a></p>\n<p>Download: <a href=\"https://github.com/alienator88/Pearcleaner/releases\">https://github.com/alienator88/Pearcleaner/releases</a></p>",

What makes sense to me, however, is that Shottr is free and although Cleanshot has plenty of more features, they're features that I just do not need currently. I also noticed Shottr has a basic tier which costs $8 for a lifetime.

Also fixed a bunch of bugs. If you have an issue with Amphetamine crashing immediately, or after enabling Triggers, try Amphetamine beta 5.3.2: <a href=\"https://testflight.apple.com/join/GeZMOAsG\">https://testflight.apple.com/join/GeZMOAsG</a> (the crash seems to be a Bluetooth permission issue with macOS Sonoma on some Macs).</p>\n<p>----------------</p>\n<p>After much delay, Amphetamine 5.3.1 was released to the App Store today. Quite a number of bugs/issues are addressed in this release (though I'm sure there's plenty more to fix/improve). The biggest improvement is the removal of the Touch ID/password requirement for Closed-Display Mode sessions on Apple Silicon Macs.</p>\n<p>On Apple Silicon Macs, Apple changed the way Closed-Display Mode works, necessitating a solution to avoid issues when connecting or disconnecting your Mac from an external power source during a Closed-Display Mode session. Amphetamine 5.3 introduced this solution as a Closed-Display Mode script that required Touch ID/a password to execute. </p>\n<p>Thanks to some clever Amphetamine users who contacted me, a way to execute the Closed-Display Mode script without Touch ID/a password was found and added to the current release, 5.3.1. The feature is now branded as Power Protect. Unfortunately, Apple made me remove Amphetamine's ability to directly install the new Power Protect script, so I built an installer package, code-signed the installer, and uploaded it to GitHub. Amphetamine 5.3.1 will prompt you to \"Learn More\" about Power Protect when you start a Closed-Display Mode session (Apple didn't like the button saying \"Install\" or \"Download\" \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f).</p>\n<p>Sometimes, people seem unhappy or impatient with how long it takes me to get updates done, or when there's a bug in the app. If you're wondering why it took so long for this release to get out (\\~2 months) or why bugs are present:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There is no Amphetamine development \"team\" as some people assume. It's just me, and the people who volunteer to translate.</li>\n<li>Software development is a hobby for me, not a job. I work at a large university and the start of the fall term is always super crazy busy.</li>\n<li>I've never taken a computer science class or even read a book in full about software development/Objective-C (the language Amphetamine is written in), so I'm often learning on the fly about how to accomplish new things. Like I said, I am not a professional developer. I just find it fun (sometimes) and challenging (always).</li>\n<li>Amphetamine is currently translated into 9 non-English languages (with 3 more coming soon - Spanish, Catalan, &amp; Traditional Chinese). Getting translation updates from volunteers takes time.</li>\n<li>My wife and daughter got COVID and were out of commission for a few weeks, leaving all the dirty dishes for me to clean.</li>\n<li>I became aware of the method to achieve Touch ID-less/password-less Power Protect later on in the development of 5.3.1 and had to redo a bunch of code I had already written.</li>\n<li>Some reported issues I have never been able to reproduce, as I don't have the hardware/accessories/etc. Working with users to troubleshoot solutions takes time and is dependent on 1) me having the time to work on/research the problem and solution, and 2) the user reporting back to me about the solutions I implement.</li>\n<li>Apple rejected the 5.3.1 update several times, forcing me to redo some code, build a code-signed installer package and translate it into 9 non-English languages, figure out how to make a GitHub Pages site (what a pain!) and then translate the site into 9 non-English languages.</li>\n<li>A bunch of other things I had to do that I won't list. \ud83e\udd75</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Anyways, the point is, I really do try to make Amphetamine a good, useful, and functional app. I enjoy working on it and solving the puzzles it presents. But as much as I like to work on Amphetamine, I just don't have the time or mental capacity some days.</p>\n<p>So, you might ask, \"What's next for Amphetamine?\" Well, I hope to completely rewrite/rearchitect the app. I may even open source it. I've been slowly working on this as Amphetamine 6.  I can't promise I'll complete this anytime in the near future (or at all), but it is something I'm working on.</p>\n<p>As always, I truly appreciate the kind words from everyone. Thanks!</p>",

I noticed that are some decent iOS apps to track your cases, but nothing native for macOS.</p>\n<p>So I decided to build <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/grant-uscis-case-tracker/id6450695507?mt=12\"><strong>Grant</strong></a>! It started as a fun side project (maybe a way to channel the immigration anxieties?), but as I kept improving it, I thought others could find it valuable as well. So I took it further with design polish and some useful features:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Tracking is instant</strong> - it pulls your case status directly instead of going through any servers, so the status is always up to date and updates are instant (I've noticed that other apps often won't reflect status updates for many hours because they funnel requests through their own services)</li>\n<li><strong>Full privacy</strong> - you don't need an account, there's no data harvesting, no ads, nothing goes to any proprietary servers. It's all under your iCloud account.</li>\n<li><strong>Case history &amp; import</strong> - the app will record your case's history from the time you add it. If you already have your history from other apps or your online USCIS account, you can import it manually.</li>\n<li><strong>One-click Emma</strong> - you can launch the Emma chat in one click to check on your case status, ask questions, and chat with agents. It also lets you save your chat transcripts for future reference.</li>\n<li><strong>Case notes</strong> - space to jot down important details about the case like tracking / reference numbers, addresses, to-do's, etc.</li>\n<li><strong>Case documents</strong> - you can keep &amp; view all the important case documents in one place like your USCIS receipt notices, emails copies, application files, etc. The documents are stored locally and backed up to your iCloud privately.</li>\n<li>Dark / light modes, simple design, native SwiftUI, and more nice touches.</li>\n<li><em>(Coming soon)</em> Grant for iOS that syncs with your macOS app.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you're an immigrant /family with a currently pending green card / h1b / etc. or planning to file soon, <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/grant-uscis-case-tracker/id6450695507?mt=12\">Grant</a> can help you in your journey. The app is free for basic use - you can track up to 4 cases &amp; track case history. The other features are paid - for now I'm just hoping to cover my costs as it's a pretty niche app. My design &amp; privacy sensitivities prevented me from going the Ads route, even though that's what most apps use in the space. I'm happy to extend a free promo code for a free month to anyone who wants to try the extra features, just let me know in the comments (if you like the app &amp; don't like subscriptions, there's a lifetime purchase option!).</p>\n<p>Bonus: if you want to make Grant even more personal, you can <a href=\"https://getgrant.app/#custom-icons\">set your own customized icon</a> - choose from 9 extra icons I designed.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: I designed and built <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/grant-uscis-case-tracker/id6450695507?mt=12\">Grant</a> - a free app (with some paid features) to track &amp; manage your USCIS cases on macOS.</p>",

Their forums are loaded with pretty pissed off users (rightfully so). </p>\n<p>ok ok, end rant on a company that seems to have pulled a fast one. </p>\n<p>Long story short, any recommendations on similar applications? </p>\n<p>My only other option is to export all of the data on the NTFS drives I have, and format them to a read and writable format for macOS. These are primarily used as my offline/local backups. Currently because NTFS for Mac is not working with my license, I only have read only access on the trial (which expires today). I refuse to buy another license from a company like this.</p>",

If you charge me a subscription (and I'm actually willing to pay your subscription), then I'm getting it through the App Store.
