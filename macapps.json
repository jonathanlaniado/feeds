It currently has 261 curated links to Mac apps that are totally free without any strings attached. I feel like this is a needed resource because much of what passes for \"free\" these days has in-app purchases that limit functionality.</p>\n<p>The site is a work in progress so I'm open to suggestions. Keep in mind that I want to mainly feature apps that have broad appeal. There are a lot of developer apps, for example, that I feel are too niche. Also, I'm shying away from web-based apps \u2014 it's too hard to keep up with them.</p>\n<p>This is my small contribution to the Mac community. I hope someone finds it helpful.</p></div>",

In that time, everything was working perfectly. Just enter the url of youtube link and press enter, no login, nothing.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Fast forward in 2020/1/2 Company introduces the Airy, a separate app for downloading Youtube videos and removes the feature from the page and do not notify any paid customer about feature removal</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://mac.eltima.com/download-manager.html\">https://mac.eltima.com/download-manager.html</a></p>\n<p>Here is release notes page of the app which never even mention feature removal:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://help.electronic.us/support/solutions/articles/44002276858-what-s-new-in-this-version-of-folx\">https://help.electronic.us/support/solutions/articles/44002276858-what-s-new-in-this-version-of-folx</a></p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>They first started by making it annoying to use Folx. e.g., asking you to log in in a internal browser page with a suggestion to buy Airy instead (which is weird, hey I paid for that feature, are you asking to pay again for the same feature?). The internal browser itself is also separate from your own browser session. However, even if you were logging in it would not work. </p>\n<p>Recently, they just went one step further and completely disabled the feature, no more youtube video download pop up. Nothing, it just try to download a html page. </p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>This to me is very disturbing behavior from the company and I believe that you as customer should know about shady practices of this company. Now, for me while the money is not a problem, and there are plenty of open source alternatives, the company behavior is disturbing and I would never buy any software from this company anymore.</p></div>",

I'm David, the developer of Noise Alerts; the app allows you to monitor the sound level at your location, and can even send you a notification if a sudden jump in noise was heard (such as someone talking to you, or something falling)</p>\n<p>Noise Alerts also comes with a helpful noise meter in the menu bar for you to easily monitor your background noise level and control the app whilst working in other programs! </p>\n<p>Noise Alerts has been designed for customisability in mind. There's a settings panel with heaps of customisation options to calibrate the app for your microphone. The app also takes on a stunning design, with everything you need presented to you simply, front and centre. </p>\n<p>I personally find the app super useful for when I'm wearing my noise-cancelling headphones, so I get a notification when someone's talking to me. </p>\n<p>People in high-risk workplaces (such as a construction site or warehouse) who also need to wear noise-cancelling headphones can use this application to get alerted not only when someone's talking to them, but also if something's fallen for example \u2014 making a huge addition to any workplace's safety.</p>\n<p>This app is also incredibly beneficial to people who experience hearing difficulties, allowing them to stay tuned in with the noise of their environment.</p>\n<p>Feel free to ask any questions or feedback here in the comments, or on Twitter! Also feel free to leave a review! <strong>Noise Alerts is available on the Mac App Store today for just $0.99 USD, but there's also 10 free codes in the comments!</strong></p>\n<p>Mac App Store: <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/noise-alerts/id1632993345\">https://apps.apple.com/app/noise-alerts/id1632993345</a></p>\n<p>Also launched today on Product Hunt: <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/posts/noise-alerts\">https://www.producthunt.com/posts/noise-alerts</a></p>\n<p>Tweet me with any feedback or questions: https://twitter.com/TheIntelCorei9</p></div>",

A\u00a0macOS native app with good performance on big files. Bike uses open file formats and is scriptable too. Use Bike to record and process your ideas.</p>\n<p>Try it out: <a href=\"https://www.hogbaysoftware.com/bike/\">Bike: Tool for thought</a></p>\n<h1>Fluid Editing</h1>\n<p>Outlines are powerful, but can be confusing. In Bike outline editing is fluid,\u00a0your ideas flow across the screen\u00a0instead of jumping from position to position. This makes it easier to track what's going on, and it's fun!</p>\n<p>Bike feels different. You can see Bike's fluid editing in this video:</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>https://reddit.com/link/urktds/video/ys6n367201091/player</p>\n<h1>Single Purchase or Subscription License</h1>\n<p>Bike is available directly from my website and through the Mac App Store. When buying directly you will own your copy of Bike and get 1 year of free updates. When buying from the Mac App Store Bike is sold using monthly or yearly subscriptions. Two coupon codes if you decide to buy from my site:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>REDDIT50</li>\n<li>50% off, only five uses</li>\n<li>REDDIT20</li>\n<li>20% off, expires May 31</li>\n</ul></div>",

My friends and I made an app that will probably be replaced by a future version of macOS someday, but it was too exciting not to do.</p>\n<p>This was all done after work over many months. In retrospect it\u2019s wild how much time goes into something like this. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s not perfect yet and we have a long list of things we want to improve, but we thought it\u2019d be a good time to get it out in the world and iterate based on feedback. </p>\n<p>It will also be available on Setapp starting later today or tomorrow, I\u2019m told.</p>\n<p>Fingers crossed \ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e it\u2019s not immediately obsolete by the upcoming WWDC announcements. \ud83d\ude2c Wouldn\u2019t surprise me. It was a lot of fun to make either way so I\u2019d still have done it again if that happens. That\u2019s probably not true, but we had fun nonetheless.</p>\n<p>Anyway, let me know if you have any questions or anything. We would like to involve everyone in future widget decisions and general making things better but still debating the best place to field lots of feedback. Maybe a subreddit? (Edit: And thus r/WidgetWall was born)</p>\n<p>I actually have to go to real work right now so it might be a while til I can respond, but I\u2019m excited to share this. Hope you like it! Thanks! -Ken</p>\n<p>https://amicoapps.com/app/widgetwall/</p>\n<p>Edit: Ok, a subscription model was a bad idea. Thank you for the feedback, it's helpful and we'll learn from it and make a better app from it.</p>\n<p>I also realize I did a disservice to my friends that built this with me when I presented the app like I did above, in a way where it might get replaced by Apple. I said that because I really feel like it's an app that should be a part of macOS. It feels very native and at home with it to me. So I am bracing myself for it to be replaced by something official because it feels like something official. I emphasized that a little too much and probably instilled concern in people considering trying it out though. But it doesn't exist yet, and maybe it won't ever. I don't know. It should. But it doesn't yet, so we have this you could use for now until it does.</p>\n<p>If anyone needs any really deep holes dug, I'm your guy.</p></div>",

I was looking for a translator which is always active in my status bar and is not needed to open a browser, switching context several times during a simple translation. I have found great translators, but I've switched a lot between \"from\" and \"to\" fields, because I was interested how is a sentence look like in more than two different languages.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://reddit.com/link/u5k1lt/video/r7q20sr262u81/player\">Translate between multiple languages.</a></p>\n<p>\ud83d\udca1 Features:</p>\n<p>- <strong>Limitless</strong>. The first translator supporting translation between multiple languages.<br />\n- You can <strong>edit any languages</strong> and others will mirror your text in their language.<br />\n- <strong>Shortcut support</strong>. You can open/close and switch language with a shortcut.<br />\n- <strong>Super Accurate</strong>. Using DeepL machine learning translation, which is proven the world's most accurate machine translation.<br />\n- <strong>OCR support</strong>. You can translate images, not just texts.<br />\n- <strong>Speech support</strong>. You can translate with your voice, without the need to write a single letter.<br />\n- <strong>Tailored for you!</strong> You control the font size, the active color, the input box height and the application language.

You are in control.<br />\n- <strong>Formality support.</strong>  Are you translating a mail response for an important client? Or you translate casual texts for your foreign friends?
