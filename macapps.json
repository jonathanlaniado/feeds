You activate it by double-pressing a modifier key and keeping it held down (you can adjust the sensitivity and duration). This will show an overlay of all your current windows with their name and window size. Moving the mouse over an application will highlight said app with a blue border letting you know you are controlling its window. At this point you just swipe with two fingers (with your other hand since you are still holding down the modifier key) in the direction of your preference and it\u2019ll dock it there. The neat thing is you can also use the arrow keys to perform the same actions. Double-clicking on a window will maximize it and you can than use the pinch gesture to scale the window to your liking (also just in one direction). Right clicking a window will minimize it.</p>\n<p>This has honestly changed how I interact with my computer. It doesn't have the same amount of window placements as other window managers but it is so quick and easy without needing to remember the blob of keyboard shortcuts.</p></div>",

If you are a non-trackpad and/or non-magic mouse user like me, you might be used to a rough scroll effect in every single app, and that does not look well. This is where <a href=\"https://mos.caldis.me\">Mos</a> comes, it enables you to get that smoother scroll effect you can expect from a magic mouse or a trackpad; that's a game changer in my opinion. </p>\n<p>That's it, you don't even have to buy a magic mouse or a trackpad ;)</p></div>",

With Monterey some new APIs made this possible in a simpler way, so I've decided to update one of my older pet projects with these new features. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://apple.co/34v7ohY\">Looking Glass</a> is a simple menu bar app coupled with an optional now playing window that aims to ease your interaction with the <em>Music</em> app (and avoid using it as much as possible). </p>\n<p>Unfortunately since we are still depending on the original Music app, we also inherit its bugs; on the plus side we will get for free the improvements Apple will hopefully make in next macOS releases. Anyway, the app works well enough for me, just bear in mind it might not be 100% perfect all the time. If you have issues, restarting it or Music may help.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The app is also compatible with Big Sur, but features such as adding tracks to library and playlists only work on Monterey.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<h3>Library search</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/RjzAL3P\">Demo</a></p>\n<p>You can type to search for tracks, albums, artists and playlists in your library, and click on the menu item that appears to start playing immediately. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You have to type <em>at least three characters</em> to activate the search.\nOn some older macOS releases I've noticed that you also have to <em>hover the search</em> field to type, otherwise the menu gets closed. Maybe it was a bug, since on Monterey you can start typing as soon as you open the menu.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Current track details</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/GY8klD5\">Demo</a></p>\n<p>Another very neat feature are the three <em>now playing</em> menu items:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Track</strong> brings you to the context of the currently playing track, such as the album or the playlist you've played it from</li>\n<li><strong>Artist</strong> brings you to the artist page</li>\n<li><strong>Album</strong> opens the album page</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The latter two are available from macOS 12+ only</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Add to Library</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/ogkrpR6\">Demo</a></p>\n<p>I've combined this feature into the \u2764\ufe0f button, so you can quickly love a track and add it to your library.  You can enable this option in the <em>Preferences</em> panel.</p>\n<h3>Rating and Add to Playlist</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/OvipKE6\">Demo</a></p>\n<p>With the <em>Rate and add...</em> menu you can quickly add tracks to a playlist and rate the current track. The first couple of playlist also have an associated keyboard shortcut, so that you can pick them without using the pointer.</p>\n<h3>Preferences</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/BHhOx0U\">Screenshot</a></p>\n<p>With the <em>Preferences</em> panel you can customize the title displayed in the menu bar, its maximum width, the keyboard shortcuts and some behavior settings. There's also an <em>About</em> panel with version and contact informations.</p>\n<h3>Keyboard shortcuts</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/X6JS95o\">Screenshot</a></p>\n<p>You can customize several global hotkeys, or leave them blank if you prefer. This is the setup I use with my mechanical keyboard.</p>\n<h3>Mini Player</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/maTGJXR\">Screenshot</a></p>\n<p>The mini player provides the album cover of the current track and keyboard shortcuts:</p>\n<p>|Key|Action|\n|---|---|\n|<strong>s</strong> or <strong>space</strong>|Toggle playback|\n|<strong>a</strong> or <strong>\u2192</strong>|Jump to next track|\n|<strong>d</strong> or <strong>\u2190</strong>|Jump to previous track|\n|<strong>w</strong>|Show Music window|\n|<strong>r</strong>|Reveal current track|\n|<strong>l</strong>|Love current track|</p>\n<h2>Links</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://apple.co/34v7ohY\">App Store</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/posts/looking-glass\">Product Hunt page</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/reviews/managing-music-from-your-macs-menu-bar/\">MacStories article</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you like the app, I'd be glad if you could give a nice review!</p>\n<h3>Promo codes</h3>\n<p>AARFLY9YMKP7\nKA3FT6HKK7LF\nTERX7NPFTR9F\nM3EL7J6AWXHK\nKEKE4LE36L7R\n34TRJNKPMEPE\n9YRLL9AREW94\nMP3XKM7TJ4NK\nAAF3PEXHYA7W\nHK6JR34AWT3W\n6YW7X4WFHAAH\nM97FL94H4LXH\nJETEPN676XAH\nMMFEWTWW346R\nFFX9FE3YYRJX\nHHAXKJA9KNKN\nYPNERHT9P6W7\nKFTFXMANRPFR\n34EFXAKK333W\nXNHEM94M9R47</p></div>",

I don't work in the tech industry, but I spend most of my day in front of the computer, and here and there, I do some coding (sometimes as a hobby and occasionally work-related). My use case is mainly PDFs and working with files, reading, writing - overall relatively on simple use(I rarely use GitHub and other development tools, but I might become more engaged in the future).</p>\n<p>Amazed by how much a tool can change my workflow, I decided to research some other tools and got sucked into productivity optimization tools' (obsessive) world. While reading about the subject, I discovered other similar tools: Alfred, LaunchBar, Command E, and others.</p>\n<p>As part of my obsession, I tried googling to figure out which tool is better (it mainly came to Alfred vs. Raycast). Still, there isn't any clear-cut answer, and I haven't managed to come across too much information from the last months (Raycast is relatively a new player in this market).</p>\n<p>It does seem that the audience is somewhat preferring Alfred because of three main reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Some say it's faster.</li>\n<li>Its community is older, with more extensions/workflows, etc.</li>\n<li>Many users suspect that Raycast will become a freemium product to return the investment, and there will be some subscription model.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The best thing to do is try Alfred myself and decide (and perhaps I will). Still, the reason for this post is I put a lot of effort into customizing Raycast, and since this is quite an intense period for me, I don't want to spend a lot of extra time testing Alfred at the moment (even though it's an addiction, I know).</p>\n<p>TLDR; Now, after Racycast has matured a bit since its release, what do you guys think? Is Alfred significantly faster? Is one of the tools more intuitive than the other for you? If so, why?</p>\n<p>Even to those of you that prefer Raycast over Alfred, do you estimate that the competition would cause Alfred to improve significantly now?</p></div>",

It transforms the native macOS app switcher into a simple and convenient tool that combines the familiar Cmd + Tab navigation and bookmarks assistant within one board.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/cd7jfpbyv1e81.png?width=2400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6cc27764da0ebca43a70e107391a4e1b4c1d225</p>\n<p>Usage:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create and manage bookmarks to have quick access to your favorite applications, projects, URLs, folders, files, or documents that are always at hand within the app switcher panel.</li>\n<li>Easy switch and surf between apps, windows, and bookmarks as you used to with a native Cmd + Tab switcher on your Mac.</li>\n<li>The app brings a feature that makes the Finder and other hidden windows of launched applications always visible while switching.</li>\n<li>Docflipper supports work with apps that have a Linking to internal files feature. For example, Figma, Notion, etc. You can add and then open shared URL\u2019s directly to your projects or files in such applications.</li>\n<li>You can turn off applications notifications in the switcher panel to focus on your job and get distraction-free.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://docflipper.com/?promo=reddit\">Download the app here</a> </p>\n<p>I\u2019ve been working on this app for the last year.</p>\n<p>The idea for this came mostly out of frustration with native app switcher on Mac. The usual behavior of macOS when the windows of launched apps might be hidden while switching with Cmd + Tab and every time needs additionally to click on app icon in the Dock panel, just to show off the app window. Docflipper fixes it and should make the switching between launched apps and Finder windows more comfortable.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/ft0mcfo8w1e81.png?width=2400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d600e74b664ccf296dd4c35a4285c88870ee5f2</p>\n<p>Also, I met the cases where I need to launch some app, doc, folder, or URL quickly, avoiding any long way to launch it from the Desktop or Launchpad. So then to resolve it I\u2019ve added the Bookmarks Assistant feature into the Cmd + Tab switcher panel.</p>\n<p>Guys, hope you find this app useful.</p>\n<p>I would be glad to get your feedback and suggestions. </p>\n<p>Cheers!</p></div>",

Love that I can share the list with her even though she's not a premium user)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://Sync.com\">Sync.com</a> app. End-to-end encrypted Cloud app and has been flawless for me, far more reliable than any other Cloud-based app and uses icon overlays to confirm files are saved. It also allows for storing files locally.</li>\n<li>Fantastical. Been using for years and it seems every few months I discover new functions. Currently using different calendar sets for various accounts, so my calendar isn't always a cluttered mess.</li>\n<li>WeatherBug. It lives in my menubar and constantly shows the temp and any precipitation wherever I'm at. Simple but reliable.</li>\n<li>Irvue. It gives me a different awesome desktop image every hour, although you can set it to change as often as you want.</li>\n<li>WhatsApp, Messenger, Signal, Telegram, etc. for desktop. I never have to reach for my phone anymore to check/respond to a message.</li>\n<li>Pulse SMS. It is basically iMessage for Android. Allows me to text from my Android number on my Mac. Beautiful UI, works flawlessly.</li>\n<li>Brave browser. Yeah, it's a browser, but has no ads, unless you turn them on, built on Chromium without the battery drain, and much much faster, almost as fast as Safari, but indistinguishably slower. Also, they pay me in crypto to use the browser. Made about $150 the last 2 years. Kinda cool.</li>\n<li>TopNotch. Hides the menubar notch. I think BTT does this too, but TopNotch is simple and clean.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I use a lot of Apple stock apps too, but I love the ones above.</p>\n<p>EDIT: Can't stop at 10. I also love Airmail and 1Password. Spark is a cool email client too, but I mostly love Airmail for it's customizations.</p></div>",

Now Mac Mouse Fix 2 is finally here! It's 100% free and open source. It's unobtrusive and light weight. And it's super easy to use while still giving you tons power for your workflow. If you use a third party mouse I think you'll love it!</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://mousefix.org\">Download</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix\">GitHub</a></p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Here's the full changelog:</p>\n<h2>Mouse Gestures done right.</h2>\n<p><strong>Click</strong> a Mouse Button <strong>and Drag</strong> in different directions to enter <strong>Mission Control</strong>, <strong>move between Spaces</strong>, or see <strong>all windows of the current app</strong> - all using just a single Button!</p>\n<p>Mac Mouse Fix Gestures feel much more <strong>fluid and responsive</strong> than any other driver on the market. This is possible because Mac Mouse Fix can precisely emulate the output of Apple's Trackpad driver.</p>\n<p>https://reddit.com/link/s5h7gb/video/x7du5jij93c81/player</p>\n<h2>With great power comes great ... ease of use!</h2>\n<p>With the new <strong>Action Table</strong>, you can set up your Mouse exactly how you want it - in seconds.</p>\n<p>Move the pointer into the \"+\" field, then simply show Mac Mouse Fix the clicks and drags that you want to assign a new Action to.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://reddit.com/link/s5h7gb/video/8s1e0ntk93c81/player\">Adding an Action for Double-Clicking the Middle Mouse Button is super simple.</a></p>\n<h2>A major boost to your productivity.</h2>\n<p>Mouse Gestures, together with the new Action Table allow you to get <strong>7x more functionality out of a single Button</strong> compared to conventional mouse drivers. All while being so simple and intuitive that you'll actually use all those features.</p>\n<p>This way anyone can leverage the convenient navigation options that make macOS so powerful - from any mouse. Even the simplest ones.</p>\n<p>For example, with the default configuration, you can use all these Actions using <strong>just the Middle Mouse Button</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mission Control</li>\n<li>Move Left a Space</li>\n<li>Move Right a Space</li>\n<li>App Expos\u00e9</li>\n<li>Show Desktop</li>\n<li>Launchpad</li>\n<li>Look Up</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And this is right out of the box. Without even tapping into the endless, yet easy-to-use customization options.</p>\n<h1>Other Features</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Go <strong>Back and Forward</strong> in Safari and other apps just like on Windows.</li>\n<li><strong>Zoom in and out</strong> by holding Command (\u2318) while scrolling. Works just like pinch-to-zoom on a trackpad.</li>\n<li>Experience a refined, friction based <strong>smooth scrolling</strong> algorithm, that strikes a great balance between fluidity and control. And also change the <strong>scrolling direction</strong> of your mouse independently from your trackpad.</li>\n<li>Use <strong>Keyboard Shortcuts</strong> right from your mouse to get even more flexibility for your workflow.</li>\n<li>You can remap to <strong>any key on your keyboard</strong>. Even function keys that are only found on Apple keyboards like 'Play-Pause', 'Increase Display Brightness', etc.</li>\n<li>And more!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>Mac Mouse Fix started out as a little hobby project to teach myself programming. But due to your support and encouragement, my goal is now to create the <strong>Best Mouse Driver Ever</strong>. With Mac Mouse Fix 2 we came quite a bit closer to that goal. Thank you! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 :)</p></div>",

I know there's a few awesome users that jumped on board from this very subreddit!</p>\n<p>OwlOCR 5 addresses a need that has been raised by its power-users multiple times over the last two years - the possibility to script OwlOCR and integrate it to different workflows! For this purpose a command line interface is provided, so it should be very accommodating to different tools. During OwlOCR 5 beta test period and after that users have already integrated it to their Alfred and Hazel workflows and I\u2019m really excited to see where all it\u2019s going to go in the future.</p>\n<p>In addition OwlOCR 5 carries all the previous iterations features like opening QR coded URLs easily, capturing any text of the screen, converting images or scans to searchable PDFs and more.</p>\n<p>OwlOCR 5 is a free upgrade to all current customers as all previous iterations have been as well. The app has a generous free tier, an automatic 3 week trial of the Premium tier and to celebrate launch the lifetime license will be -30% until 12th January!</p>\n<p>It is also launching on Product Hunt right now, so if you're a Product Hunt users, will be happy to get some love on that forum as well!</p>\n<p>Product Hunt: <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/posts/owlocr-5\">https://www.producthunt.com/posts/owlocr-5</a></p>\n<p>Homepage: <a href=\"https://owlocr.com/\">https://owlocr.com</a></p>\n<p>Mac App Store: <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/owlocr-screenshot-to-text/id1499181666\">https://apps.apple.com/us/app/owlocr-screenshot-to-text/id1499181666</a></p></div>",

It's the ability to search your images directly for texts within them.<br />\nThe app is called <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/qfindify/id1598790473?mt=12\">QFindify</a>, it's available on the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/qfindify/id1598790473?mt=12\">AppStore</a>, and it's a menubar app where you can drag/drop or import images and perform searches for words to narrow down to the images that contains those words.</p>\n<p>This is personally very useful if you have a lot of screenshots or folder full of images but you don't really have a way to quickly identify the images that have specific words,  for example \"lecture Biology Sociology wednesday\".<br />\nWhat makes QFindify different from similar apps is that all processing is done locally on your Mac rather than connecting to external online servers, thus all your data stay where they belong, on your mac.<br />\nThere's an image preview panel allowing to view the images as you scroll through your search results and at any moment, open the image directly. You can toggle to keep the app afloat so your can directly drag and drop batches of images or import from a panel.</p>\n<p>The app is free to download and completely free to use all the features I've mentioned above.<br />\nBut there is a one time IAP of 1.99 if you need additional enhancements and a bit more advanced capability.<br />\nSome Advanced Mode features are:<br />\n- advanced filtering options of: ANY/ALL/NONE/EXACT and Regex/pattern matching<br />\n- Save all the images meeting your search into a single unified PDF and open it<br />\n- Create and save all the images matching your search into a New Folder<br />\n- Completely detach the app from the Menubar and float above all other apps<br />\n- Other options to fine tune performance: adjust recognition level, language correction, optimize for specific language, limit to perform to CPU/GPU, etc.</p>\n<p>There is an update coming within next few days of: Near instantaneous live search results without you having to press enter key and some animation stabilities.<br />\nThis is my first app ever after jumping into programming back in 2018, so I would love to hear any feedbacks you guys have and especially let me know if you notice any bugs/glitches you want me to fix up on.</p></div>",

I don't care about Kindle or Kobo Bookstore functionality. I want to be able to read my books that I have on my iPad and annotate them (underline, make notes on the margins, etc) and then have that somehow sync to OneNote. Is there a solution for this? I'm not sure if a dedicated app like PDF Expert is the way to go, or some other cloud app solution?  Other apps I've looked into in this space are Highlighter, Flexcil, Marginnotes, Liquidtext. (Will these allow annotations in both PDFs and EPUBs? Or only PDFs? There's too many apps in this space but not sure if they will do what I'm looking for which is to be able to take my thoughts from the books I'm reading and then bringing them into a knowledge database (which for now is in OneNote). </li>\n<li>I also read alot of articles on the web (like on Medium, Reddit posts, Quora, etc) and want to capture other people's great insights and thoughts into my OneNote system. I've read good things about ReadWise, but a few problems are that its not free, and it doesnt have integration with OneNote. Are there other tools out there that can allow you to pull your insights from articles and enable you to import them into OneNote?</li>\n<li>Related to the knowledge management system itself, my current knowledge management system is within OneNote. OneNote doesnt have bidirectional link capability like RoamResearch or Obsidian, nor is it as flashy as Notion is, but its free, cross platform, allows multiple people to use at the same time, and syncs really well across my devices so it sort of works for now until I can find a better alternative. Apps like Roam are either pricy, or in beta like Obsidian (which means they likely will have costs in the future). I would much rather either go self-hosted for free, or find an alternative to OneNote. I have read that Microsoft Loop may be a Notion alternative and may integrate with OneNote natively. Has anyone had a beta test of Microsoft Loop and if so, how does it function? Also I'm aware it may not be free, but if it is free as part of the Office 365 package it may be an appealing prospect.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you have ideas on my workflow above and think there are ways to do it better <strong>please, please</strong> let me know. <strong>I've spent months</strong> looking for something that will work effectively. And I've been sort of lost, there's so many apps and services out there, different fragmented ecosystems, little interoperability between systems, its a mess.  I know there is paid solutions like Readwise and Notion that can do some of this, but hoping there is really good alternatives. </p>\n<p>I also fear being \"locked in\" to any kind of ecosystem with proprietary databases. So far with OneNote I know my data is text format, so although it would be a pain to copy the text from every OneNote tab I have, atleast I know I can do it. </p>\n<p>Thank you so much for your help reading this and for your time. Eternally grateful for your advice,</p></div>",

The list was very extensive and worked just like ad-blocker but on the OS level rather than the browser. </p>\n<p>This made me think that it would be great if such list existed for Little Snitch.
