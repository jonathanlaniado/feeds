My friends and I made an app that will probably be replaced by a future version of macOS someday, but it was too exciting not to do.</p>\n<p>This was all done after work over many months. In retrospect it\u2019s wild how much time goes into something like this. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s not perfect yet and we have a long list of things we want to improve, but we thought it\u2019d be a good time to get it out in the world and iterate based on feedback. </p>\n<p>It will also be available on Setapp starting later today or tomorrow, I\u2019m told.</p>\n<p>Fingers crossed \ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e it\u2019s not immediately obsolete by the upcoming WWDC announcements. \ud83d\ude2c Wouldn\u2019t surprise me. It was a lot of fun to make either way so I\u2019d still have done it again if that happens. That\u2019s probably not true, but we had fun nonetheless.</p>\n<p>Anyway, let me know if you have any questions or anything. We would like to involve everyone in future widget decisions and general making things better but still debating the best place to field lots of feedback. Maybe a subreddit? (Edit: And thus r/WidgetWall was born)</p>\n<p>I actually have to go to real work right now so it might be a while til I can respond, but I\u2019m excited to share this. Hope you like it! Thanks! -Ken</p>\n<p>https://amicoapps.com/app/widgetwall/</p>\n<p>Edit: Ok, a subscription model was a bad idea. Thank you for the feedback, it's helpful and we'll learn from it and make a better app from it.</p>\n<p>I also realize I did a disservice to my friends that built this with me when I presented the app like I did above, in a way where it might get replaced by Apple. I said that because I really feel like it's an app that should be a part of macOS. It feels very native and at home with it to me. So I am bracing myself for it to be replaced by something official because it feels like something official. I emphasized that a little too much and probably instilled concern in people considering trying it out though. But it doesn't exist yet, and maybe it won't ever. I don't know. It should. But it doesn't yet, so we have this you could use for now until it does.</p>\n<p>If anyone needs any really deep holes dug, I'm your guy.</p></div>",

I was looking for a translator which is always active in my status bar and is not needed to open a browser, switching context several times during a simple translation. I have found great translators, but I've switched a lot between \"from\" and \"to\" fields, because I was interested how is a sentence look like in more than two different languages.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://reddit.com/link/u5k1lt/video/r7q20sr262u81/player\">Translate between multiple languages.</a></p>\n<p>\ud83d\udca1 Features:</p>\n<p>- <strong>Limitless</strong>. The first translator supporting translation between multiple languages.<br />\n- You can <strong>edit any languages</strong> and others will mirror your text in their language.<br />\n- <strong>Shortcut support</strong>. You can open/close and switch language with a shortcut.<br />\n- <strong>Super Accurate</strong>. Using DeepL machine learning translation, which is proven the world's most accurate machine translation.<br />\n- <strong>OCR support</strong>. You can translate images, not just texts.<br />\n- <strong>Speech support</strong>. You can translate with your voice, without the need to write a single letter.<br />\n- <strong>Tailored for you!</strong> You control the font size, the active color, the input box height and the application language. Translating a lot? Set a bigger height and smaller font to see more. Translating words or shorter texts? Set a bigger font size and adjust a smaller input height to have more space. You are in control.<br />\n- <strong>Formality support.</strong>  Are you translating a mail response for an important client? Or you translate casual texts for your foreign friends? You decide how formal your text is going to be, by setting formality for your translatable languages.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/6378ugkmb2u81.jpg?width=1217&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b148b37d0b9b080eb4c4102a152b3f2cd5481627\">Set formality.</a></p>\n<p>\ud83d\udcf9 Showcase</p>\n<p>You can find a short video about each feature <a href=\"https://tinytranslate.app\">here</a>!</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>\ud83d\udd87 Links:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://tinytranslate.app\">Official website</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/tinytranslate/id1616724873\">Download</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/tiny_translate\">News</a></p></div>",

You activate it by double-pressing a modifier key and keeping it held down (you can adjust the sensitivity and duration). This will show an overlay of all your current windows with their name and window size. Moving the mouse over an application will highlight said app with a blue border letting you know you are controlling its window. At this point you just swipe with two fingers (with your other hand since you are still holding down the modifier key) in the direction of your preference and it\u2019ll dock it there. The neat thing is you can also use the arrow keys to perform the same actions. Double-clicking on a window will maximize it and you can than use the pinch gesture to scale the window to your liking (also just in one direction). Right clicking a window will minimize it.</p>\n<p>This has honestly changed how I interact with my computer. It doesn't have the same amount of window placements as other window managers but it is so quick and easy without needing to remember the blob of keyboard shortcuts.</p></div>",

With Monterey some new APIs made this possible in a simpler way, so I've decided to update one of my older pet projects with these new features. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://apple.co/34v7ohY\">Looking Glass</a> is a simple menu bar app coupled with an optional now playing window that aims to ease your interaction with the <em>Music</em> app (and avoid using it as much as possible). </p>\n<p>Unfortunately since we are still depending on the original Music app, we also inherit its bugs; on the plus side we will get for free the improvements Apple will hopefully make in next macOS releases. Anyway, the app works well enough for me, just bear in mind it might not be 100% perfect all the time. If you have issues, restarting it or Music may help.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The app is also compatible with Big Sur, but features such as adding tracks to library and playlists only work on Monterey.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<h3>Library search</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/RjzAL3P\">Demo</a></p>\n<p>You can type to search for tracks, albums, artists and playlists in your library, and click on the menu item that appears to start playing immediately. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You have to type <em>at least three characters</em> to activate the search.\nOn some older macOS releases I've noticed that you also have to <em>hover the search</em> field to type, otherwise the menu gets closed. Maybe it was a bug, since on Monterey you can start typing as soon as you open the menu.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Current track details</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/GY8klD5\">Demo</a></p>\n<p>Another very neat feature are the three <em>now playing</em> menu items:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Track</strong> brings you to the context of the currently playing track, such as the album or the playlist you've played it from</li>\n<li><strong>Artist</strong> brings you to the artist page</li>\n<li><strong>Album</strong> opens the album page</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The latter two are available from macOS 12+ only</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Add to Library</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/ogkrpR6\">Demo</a></p>\n<p>I've combined this feature into the \u2764\ufe0f button, so you can quickly love a track and add it to your library.  You can enable this option in the <em>Preferences</em> panel.</p>\n<h3>Rating and Add to Playlist</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/OvipKE6\">Demo</a></p>\n<p>With the <em>Rate and add...</em> menu you can quickly add tracks to a playlist and rate the current track. The first couple of playlist also have an associated keyboard shortcut, so that you can pick them without using the pointer.</p>\n<h3>Preferences</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/BHhOx0U\">Screenshot</a></p>\n<p>With the <em>Preferences</em> panel you can customize the title displayed in the menu bar, its maximum width, the keyboard shortcuts and some behavior settings. There's also an <em>About</em> panel with version and contact informations.</p>\n<h3>Keyboard shortcuts</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/X6JS95o\">Screenshot</a></p>\n<p>You can customize several global hotkeys, or leave them blank if you prefer. This is the setup I use with my mechanical keyboard.</p>\n<h3>Mini Player</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/maTGJXR\">Screenshot</a></p>\n<p>The mini player provides the album cover of the current track and keyboard shortcuts:</p>\n<p>|Key|Action|\n|---|---|\n|<strong>s</strong> or <strong>space</strong>|Toggle playback|\n|<strong>a</strong> or <strong>\u2192</strong>|Jump to next track|\n|<strong>d</strong> or <strong>\u2190</strong>|Jump to previous track|\n|<strong>w</strong>|Show Music window|\n|<strong>r</strong>|Reveal current track|\n|<strong>l</strong>|Love current track|</p>\n<h2>Links</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://apple.co/34v7ohY\">App Store</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/posts/looking-glass\">Product Hunt page</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/reviews/managing-music-from-your-macs-menu-bar/\">MacStories article</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you like the app, I'd be glad if you could give a nice review!</p>\n<h3>Promo codes</h3>\n<p>AARFLY9YMKP7\nKA3FT6HKK7LF\nTERX7NPFTR9F\nM3EL7J6AWXHK\nKEKE4LE36L7R\n34TRJNKPMEPE\n9YRLL9AREW94\nMP3XKM7TJ4NK\nAAF3PEXHYA7W\nHK6JR34AWT3W\n6YW7X4WFHAAH\nM97FL94H4LXH\nJETEPN676XAH\nMMFEWTWW346R\nFFX9FE3YYRJX\nHHAXKJA9KNKN\nYPNERHT9P6W7\nKFTFXMANRPFR\n34EFXAKK333W\nXNHEM94M9R47</p></div>",

I don't work in the tech industry, but I spend most of my day in front of the computer, and here and there, I do some coding (sometimes as a hobby and occasionally work-related). My use case is mainly PDFs and working with files, reading, writing - overall relatively on simple use(I rarely use GitHub and other development tools, but I might become more engaged in the future).</p>\n<p>Amazed by how much a tool can change my workflow, I decided to research some other tools and got sucked into productivity optimization tools' (obsessive) world. While reading about the subject, I discovered other similar tools: Alfred, LaunchBar, Command E, and others.</p>\n<p>As part of my obsession, I tried googling to figure out which tool is better (it mainly came to Alfred vs. Raycast). Still, there isn't any clear-cut answer, and I haven't managed to come across too much information from the last months (Raycast is relatively a new player in this market).</p>\n<p>It does seem that the audience is somewhat preferring Alfred because of three main reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Some say it's faster.</li>\n<li>Its community is older, with more extensions/workflows, etc.</li>\n<li>Many users suspect that Raycast will become a freemium product to return the investment, and there will be some subscription model.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The best thing to do is try Alfred myself and decide (and perhaps I will). Still, the reason for this post is I put a lot of effort into customizing Raycast, and since this is quite an intense period for me, I don't want to spend a lot of extra time testing Alfred at the moment (even though it's an addiction, I know).</p>\n<p>TLDR; Now, after Racycast has matured a bit since its release, what do you guys think? Is Alfred significantly faster? Is one of the tools more intuitive than the other for you? If so, why?</p>\n<p>Even to those of you that prefer Raycast over Alfred, do you estimate that the competition would cause Alfred to improve significantly now?</p></div>",

It transforms the native macOS app switcher into a simple and convenient tool that combines the familiar Cmd + Tab navigation and bookmarks assistant within one board.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/cd7jfpbyv1e81.png?width=2400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6cc27764da0ebca43a70e107391a4e1b4c1d225</p>\n<p>Usage:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create and manage bookmarks to have quick access to your favorite applications, projects, URLs, folders, files, or documents that are always at hand within the app switcher panel.</li>\n<li>Easy switch and surf between apps, windows, and bookmarks as you used to with a native Cmd + Tab switcher on your Mac.</li>\n<li>The app brings a feature that makes the Finder and other hidden windows of launched applications always visible while switching.</li>\n<li>Docflipper supports work with apps that have a Linking to internal files feature. For example, Figma, Notion, etc. You can add and then open shared URL\u2019s directly to your projects or files in such applications.</li>\n<li>You can turn off applications notifications in the switcher panel to focus on your job and get distraction-free.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://docflipper.com/?promo=reddit\">Download the app here</a> </p>\n<p>I\u2019ve been working on this app for the last year.</p>\n<p>The idea for this came mostly out of frustration with native app switcher on Mac. The usual behavior of macOS when the windows of launched apps might be hidden while switching with Cmd + Tab and every time needs additionally to click on app icon in the Dock panel, just to show off the app window. Docflipper fixes it and should make the switching between launched apps and Finder windows more comfortable.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/ft0mcfo8w1e81.png?width=2400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d600e74b664ccf296dd4c35a4285c88870ee5f2</p>\n<p>Also, I met the cases where I need to launch some app, doc, folder, or URL quickly, avoiding any long way to launch it from the Desktop or Launchpad. So then to resolve it I\u2019ve added the Bookmarks Assistant feature into the Cmd + Tab switcher panel.</p>\n<p>Guys, hope you find this app useful.</p>\n<p>I would be glad to get your feedback and suggestions. </p>\n<p>Cheers!</p></div>",

Yeah, it's a browser, but has no ads, unless you turn them on, built on Chromium without the battery drain, and much much faster, almost as fast as Safari, but indistinguishably slower.

Now Mac Mouse Fix 2 is finally here! It's 100% free and open source. It's unobtrusive and light weight. And it's super easy to use while still giving you tons power for your workflow. If you use a third party mouse I think you'll love it!</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://mousefix.org\">Download</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix\">GitHub</a></p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Here's the full changelog:</p>\n<h2>Mouse Gestures done right.</h2>\n<p><strong>Click</strong> a Mouse Button <strong>and Drag</strong> in different directions to enter <strong>Mission Control</strong>, <strong>move between Spaces</strong>, or see <strong>all windows of the current app</strong> - all using just a single Button!</p>\n<p>Mac Mouse Fix Gestures feel much more <strong>fluid and responsive</strong> than any other driver on the market. This is possible because Mac Mouse Fix can precisely emulate the output of Apple's Trackpad driver.</p>\n<p>https://reddit.com/link/s5h7gb/video/x7du5jij93c81/player</p>\n<h2>With great power comes great ... ease of use!</h2>\n<p>With the new <strong>Action Table</strong>, you can set up your Mouse exactly how you want it - in seconds.</p>\n<p>Move the pointer into the \"+\" field, then simply show Mac Mouse Fix the clicks and drags that you want to assign a new Action to.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://reddit.com/link/s5h7gb/video/8s1e0ntk93c81/player\">Adding an Action for Double-Clicking the Middle Mouse Button is super simple.</a></p>\n<h2>A major boost to your productivity.</h2>\n<p>Mouse Gestures, together with the new Action Table allow you to get <strong>7x more functionality out of a single Button</strong> compared to conventional mouse drivers. All while being so simple and intuitive that you'll actually use all those features.</p>\n<p>This way anyone can leverage the convenient navigation options that make macOS so powerful - from any mouse. Even the simplest ones.</p>\n<p>For example, with the default configuration, you can use all these Actions using <strong>just the Middle Mouse Button</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mission Control</li>\n<li>Move Left a Space</li>\n<li>Move Right a Space</li>\n<li>App Expos\u00e9</li>\n<li>Show Desktop</li>\n<li>Launchpad</li>\n<li>Look Up</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And this is right out of the box. Without even tapping into the endless, yet easy-to-use customization options.</p>\n<h1>Other Features</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Go <strong>Back and Forward</strong> in Safari and other apps just like on Windows.</li>\n<li><strong>Zoom in and out</strong> by holding Command (\u2318) while scrolling. Works just like pinch-to-zoom on a trackpad.</li>\n<li>Experience a refined, friction based <strong>smooth scrolling</strong> algorithm, that strikes a great balance between fluidity and control. And also change the <strong>scrolling direction</strong> of your mouse independently from your trackpad.</li>\n<li>Use <strong>Keyboard Shortcuts</strong> right from your mouse to get even more flexibility for your workflow.</li>\n<li>You can remap to <strong>any key on your keyboard</strong>. Even function keys that are only found on Apple keyboards like 'Play-Pause', 'Increase Display Brightness', etc.</li>\n<li>And more!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>Mac Mouse Fix started out as a little hobby project to teach myself programming. But due to your support and encouragement, my goal is now to create the <strong>Best Mouse Driver Ever</strong>. With Mac Mouse Fix 2 we came quite a bit closer to that goal. Thank you! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 :)</p></div>",
