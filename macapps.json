It's an app designed for effortless note-taking, resembling a chat interface to build a personal timeline. It offers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Chronological, chat-like note entry.</li>\n<li>Tagging for organization.</li>\n<li>Global shortcuts for quick access.</li>\n<li>A native Mac app look and feel.</li>\n<li>Encrypted iCloud backup &amp; synchronization.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Developing Strflow has been a fulfilling journey. There are more features I want to add, but I am satisfied with its current state. If you're interested, please visit the website, try the app, and share your thoughts!</p>\n<p>Strflow is free for unlimited notes, tags, and attachments. The Strflow Plus plan, offering encrypted iCloud backup &amp; synchronization, is available for $0.99/month or $9.99/year as a special introductory offer. This rate will be honored for subscribers who join now, as long as their subscription is continuous.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://strflow.app\">Web Site</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/strflow-notes-journal/id6468486339?l=en-US&amp;mt=12\">Mac App Store</a></p>\n<p>PS: Currently working on developing an iOS version of Strflow\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udcbb</p>",

Each monitor can be configured to show real-time or historical information, and output can be written to a CSV file later parsing if you wish.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/audfl7wtiv9c1.png?width=1492&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7cd6b0fd0cedfb920afd24ef4ebd2d6123ac7915\">PeakHour's Internet Dashboard, showing a real-time view of latency and throughput.</a></p>\n<p>Some key new features of PeakHour 5:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Internet Dashboard</strong>: This new feature offers a single, comprehensive view of your internet connection's health, including local, ISP, and overall internet latency.</li>\n<li><strong>Multi-Host Latency Monitoring</strong>: Now, you can monitor latency between any two internet points, like your ISP and Google, for a better understanding of connection quality and latency.</li>\n<li><strong>Local Interface Monitoring</strong>: Monitor your Mac's network interfaces directly, without additional tool\u200bs.</li>\n<li><strong>More flexible window layout</strong>: More flexibility in arranging monitors, especially useful with multiple monitor\u200bs.</li>\n<li><strong>MacOS Sonoma Compatibility</strong>: Fully updated UI to match the latest macOS advancement\u200bs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And there's more \u2013 improved ping accuracy, horizontal scroll lock, streamlined First Time Setup and lots more.</p>\n<p>You can grab it now exclusively in the Mac Appstor\u200be.

You might have heard about the app: It\u2018s a powerful screen shot, screen recording, file (basically anything) uploading tool for macOS and iOS, that works with almost any file storage provider you can imagine.</p>\n<p>Since this year is the 10th anniversary of the app, and I\u2018ve never done a Reddit-exclusive sale before, I\u2018m happy to tell you that with the coupon code \u201ereddit\u201c, you\u2018ll be able to get Dropshare for macOS for yourself or a friend (via https://dropshare.app/gift) for 40% off until after Xmas.</p>\n<p>There is a free 7 day trial on both macOS (just download and use it with no details required) and iOS (via the subscription, which is only payable after 7 days and can be cancelled free of charge before). </p>\n<p>Dropshare is usually once per year part of an App Bundle as well, so if you\u2018re looking for a better deal, there most probably will be one - might take a few months tho.</p>\n<p>Appreciate your support (you guys frequently mail me with feature ideas) in the past 10 years, and looking forward to many more.</p>\n<p>Enjoy the holidays with your friends and family.</p>\n<p>Best,\nT.</p>\n<p>Edit: Discounted iOS subscription available here: https://apps.apple.com/redeem?ctx=offercodes&amp;id=932316817&amp;code=REDDIT</p>",

As a macOS user, I've always wanted a powerful solution to block ads and trackers across browsers, desktop applications, and the OS itself. All of the existing solutions are either paid or offered via a freemium model, which motivated me to create Zen.</p>\n<p><strong>What Makes Zen Unique</strong>: Zen operates system-wide, intercepting network requests from all applications. It efficiently blocks ads, tracking scripts, malware, and other unwanted content that traditional browser extensions might miss. This includes trackers in desktop apps and system components. Zen works across multiple platforms, is free and will always offer full functionality without additional payments.</p>\n<p>Zen is primarily licensed under the MIT License, with some components under different terms. To learn more about Zen and how it can help protect your digital privacy, visit our GitHub page: <a href=\"https://github.com/anfragment/zen\">Zen on GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p>Looking forward to your feedback to make Zen even better!</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/1hetedf8xb4c1.png?width=994&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=380896f8da94dcf229e89991af492e482299f716</p>",

Double-click to open an image, use left and right arrow keys to navigate, and scroll the mouse wheel to zoom in and out.\n- Clean and minimalistic design. Only necessary elements are displayed, without any unnecessary distractions.\n- <strong>Supports a wide range of image formats</strong>, including PNG, JPG, WEBP, BMP, ICO, GIF, CR2, CR3, NEF, HEIC, and more.\n- <strong>Offers various image viewing modes</strong>, including single-window and multiple-window viewing. Supports eight scaling modes, such as screen-fit, window-fit, actual size and so on.\n- <strong>Highly responsive, providing smooth image browsing and fast loading</strong>. Written in native Swift, with a small installation package size of only <strong>7.1MB</strong>.\n- User-friendly, with a rich set of keyboard shortcuts. It also supports image pinned and <strong>LiveText</strong>.</p>\n<p>Picview addresses the need for a Windows Photos-like image viewing experience on macOS. It can be downloaded for free from the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/picview-image-photo-browser/id6452016140?mt=12?mt=12\">App Store</a></p>\n<p>For more information, you can visit our <a href=\"https://enpicview.chitaner.com\">official website</a></p>\n<p>We would greatly appreciate it if you could provide us with your feedback and suggestions.</p>",

Here are mine:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://flashbang.lol/\">Flashbang</a> (free) - A very simple flashcards app that also works as a great alternative to Quizlet's Learn. Simpler than Anki, and it allows for very easy import and export</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://menubarx.app/\">MenubarX</a> (free/$5) - A handy app that allows you to pin websites to your menubar. I think Pro is worth it to be able to create multiple pins</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/barbee-hide-menu-bar-items/id1548711022\">Barbee</a> ($4) - A great app that adds a bar below your menubar for computers with a notch. It's kind of unintuitive to set up but definitely worth it for the price. If you want an almost exact alternative to Bartender, use <a href=\"https://shottr.cc/s/1jm7/SCR-20231128-qts.png\">these</a> settings</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wouter01.github.io/MediaMate/\">MediaMate</a> (\u20ac5.99) - This is honestly one of my favorite Mac apps I've ever purchased. I think it's essential, especially if your Mac has a notch.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.upscayl.org/\">Upscayl</a> - Very powerful image upscaler using AI, completely free and open source</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wins.cool/\">Wins</a> ($14) - An app I heard about from a developer's post on this sub and it's become my favorite window manager. It's strength is its simplicity and doesn't bombard you with necessary features</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Pyroh/Fluor\">Flour</a> (free) - A simple app that changes functionality of the Fn keys depending on the open app</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://doomlaser.com/cursorcerer-hide-your-cursor-at-will/\">Cursorcerer</a> (free) - Allows you to hide your cursor with a hotkey. I hardly ever use it but it's very helpful when I am trying to watch something and the mouse won't go away</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/tr/app/grab2text-screen-ocr/id6457416917?mt=12\">Grab2Text</a> ($2) - Grap the text from any part of your screen and copy it to clipboard with a hotkey</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kristopherjohnson/MenubarCountdown\">Menubar Countdown</a> (free) - Simple timer that lives in your menubar and displays a countdown</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cakebrew.com/\">Cakebrew</a> (free) - GUI for Homebrew</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://micropixels.software/batfi\">Batfi</a> (free) - Battery protector/charging limiter. A great AlDente alternative</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://objective-see.org/index.html\">Objective See Apps</a> (free) - A suite of useful security apps, all completely free</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.studentappcentre.com/\">Student App Centre</a> is a very helpful resource if you are a student in high school or college and are looking for discounts!</p>",

In the past seven days, there have been over 1,000 users, and in the last 28 days, approximately 2,000 people have used Wins.</p>\n<p>I feel incredibly honored that Wins has been able to help you, and I am sincerely grateful for your support in my independent development journey.</p>\n<h1>About Development Status</h1>\n<p>During the year, I received a lot of feedback and suggestions, coupled with my understanding of Apple's product philosophy, I want to make something wonderful to bring to the macOS X, so I've added some features that I think are cool in the past year\uff0csuch as :</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Dock Window Preview</strong>. Now you can directly preview all windows of an app you opened</li>\n</ol>\n<p>https://reddit.com/link/17ywznm/video/d2kgpg331b1c1/player</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Shake window to hide other windows</strong>.

One shortcut to hide all windows, and the world becomes clean</li>\n</ol>\n<p>https://reddit.com/link/17ywznm/video/hwnuat771b1c1/player</p>\n<p>I'm a bit of a perfectionist, trying to make the product as perfect and clean as possible, and obviously Wins isn't perfect enough.</p>\n<p>I still have a lot of features in mind, such as pin a window puts it at the frontest and support for users to add theirs custom layout to the Floating Split Window and set shortcuts separately and more</p>\n<h1>In the end</h1>\n<p>I'm not a famous developer, I don't have much of audiences, I don't know how to market or promote, I just an Apple fan who loves the macOS.</p>\n<p>it wasn't an easy year for Wins, But luckily it's alive. I'm alive haha</p>\n<p>I currently have a job, but initially, I thought Wins could sustain itself through independent development. However, I later realized that the timing might not be right yet. But I believe that as long as I continue to polish Wins and make it better, it will be able to independently support me in continuously developing new features.</p>\n<p>Finally, I almost forgot to mention the most important thing! Haha</p>\n<p>\ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wins.cool/\">Wins</a> is offering a 50% discount with code <strong>BLACKFRIDAY_2023</strong> during Black Friday.</p>\n<p>If you like it and want to support independent development(thanks a lot), or if you haven't tried Wins yet, I hope you give it a try\ud83e\udef6.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Love you all guys\\~</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>",

It searches the drive for leftover files as good as it can based on a combination of app name and bundle id. It also has a file monitor that you can optionally enable which will pop up the app if you trash an application, suggesting remaining files to also delete.</p>\n<p>Note: Since I don't have a paid developer account, I don't notarize the app so you might have to right click + open the first time if it shows untrusted.

            "content_html": "<caption>Open: <a href='apollo://www.reddit.com/r/macapps/comments/17r2wo5/amphetamine_531_release/'>Apollo</a> | <a href='https://reddit.com/r/macapps/comments/17r2wo5/amphetamine_531_release/'>Reddit</a></caption><div><br></div><p>Hello \ud83d\udc4b\ud83c\udffc</p>\n<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> Amphetamine 5.3.1 has been released in the App Store and the Touch ID/password requirement for the Closed-Display Mode script on Apple Silicon Macs has been removed. Also fixed a bunch of bugs. If you have an issue with Amphetamine crashing immediately, or after enabling Triggers, try Amphetamine beta 5.3.2: <a href=\"https://testflight.apple.com/join/GeZMOAsG\">https://testflight.apple.com/join/GeZMOAsG</a> (the crash seems to be a Bluetooth permission issue with macOS Sonoma on some Macs).</p>\n<p>----------------</p>\n<p>After much delay, Amphetamine 5.3.1 was released to the App Store today. Quite a number of bugs/issues are addressed in this release (though I'm sure there's plenty more to fix/improve). The biggest improvement is the removal of the Touch ID/password requirement for Closed-Display Mode sessions on Apple Silicon Macs.</p>\n<p>On Apple Silicon Macs, Apple changed the way Closed-Display Mode works, necessitating a solution to avoid issues when connecting or disconnecting your Mac from an external power source during a Closed-Display Mode session. Amphetamine 5.3 introduced this solution as a Closed-Display Mode script that required Touch ID/a password to execute. </p>\n<p>Thanks to some clever Amphetamine users who contacted me, a way to execute the Closed-Display Mode script without Touch ID/a password was found and added to the current release, 5.3.1. The feature is now branded as Power Protect. Unfortunately, Apple made me remove Amphetamine's ability to directly install the new Power Protect script, so I built an installer package, code-signed the installer, and uploaded it to GitHub. Amphetamine 5.3.1 will prompt you to \"Learn More\" about Power Protect when you start a Closed-Display Mode session (Apple didn't like the button saying \"Install\" or \"Download\" \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f).</p>\n<p>Sometimes, people seem unhappy or impatient with how long it takes me to get updates done, or when there's a bug in the app. If you're wondering why it took so long for this release to get out (\\~2 months) or why bugs are present:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There is no Amphetamine development \"team\" as some people assume. It's just me, and the people who volunteer to translate.</li>\n<li>Software development is a hobby for me, not a job. I work at a large university and the start of the fall term is always super crazy busy.</li>\n<li>I've never taken a computer science class or even read a book in full about software development/Objective-C (the language Amphetamine is written in), so I'm often learning on the fly about how to accomplish new things. Like I said, I am not a professional developer. I just find it fun (sometimes) and challenging (always).</li>\n<li>Amphetamine is currently translated into 9 non-English languages (with 3 more coming soon - Spanish, Catalan, &amp; Traditional Chinese). Getting translation updates from volunteers takes time.</li>\n<li>My wife and daughter got COVID and were out of commission for a few weeks, leaving all the dirty dishes for me to clean.</li>\n<li>I became aware of the method to achieve Touch ID-less/password-less Power Protect later on in the development of 5.3.1 and had to redo a bunch of code I had already written.</li>\n<li>Some reported issues I have never been able to reproduce, as I don't have the hardware/accessories/etc. Working with users to troubleshoot solutions takes time and is dependent on 1) me having the time to work on/research the problem and solution, and 2) the user reporting back to me about the solutions I implement.</li>\n<li>Apple rejected the 5.3.1 update several times, forcing me to redo some code, build a code-signed installer package and translate it into 9 non-English languages, figure out how to make a GitHub Pages site (what a pain!) and then translate the site into 9 non-English languages.</li>\n<li>A bunch of other things I had to do that I won't list. \ud83e\udd75</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Anyways, the point is, I really do try to make Amphetamine a good, useful, and functional app. I enjoy working on it and solving the puzzles it presents. But as much as I like to work on Amphetamine, I just don't have the time or mental capacity some days.</p>\n<p>So, you might ask, \"What's next for Amphetamine?\" Well, I hope to completely rewrite/rearchitect the app. I may even open source it. I've been slowly working on this as Amphetamine 6.  I can't promise I'll complete this anytime in the near future (or at all), but it is something I'm working on.</p>\n<p>As always, I truly appreciate the kind words from everyone. Thanks!</p>",

I noticed that are some decent iOS apps to track your cases, but nothing native for macOS.</p>\n<p>So I decided to build <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/grant-uscis-case-tracker/id6450695507?mt=12\"><strong>Grant</strong></a>! It started as a fun side project (maybe a way to channel the immigration anxieties?), but as I kept improving it, I thought others could find it valuable as well. So I took it further with design polish and some useful features:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Tracking is instant</strong> - it pulls your case status directly instead of going through any servers, so the status is always up to date and updates are instant (I've noticed that other apps often won't reflect status updates for many hours because they funnel requests through their own services)</li>\n<li><strong>Full privacy</strong> - you don't need an account, there's no data harvesting, no ads, nothing goes to any proprietary servers. It's all under your iCloud account.</li>\n<li><strong>Case history &amp; import</strong> - the app will record your case's history from the time you add it. If you already have your history from other apps or your online USCIS account, you can import it manually.</li>\n<li><strong>One-click Emma</strong> - you can launch the Emma chat in one click to check on your case status, ask questions, and chat with agents. It also lets you save your chat transcripts for future reference.</li>\n<li><strong>Case notes</strong> - space to jot down important details about the case like tracking / reference numbers, addresses, to-do's, etc.</li>\n<li><strong>Case documents</strong> - you can keep &amp; view all the important case documents in one place like your USCIS receipt notices, emails copies, application files, etc. The documents are stored locally and backed up to your iCloud privately.</li>\n<li>Dark / light modes, simple design, native SwiftUI, and more nice touches.</li>\n<li><em>(Coming soon)</em> Grant for iOS that syncs with your macOS app.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you're an immigrant /family with a currently pending green card / h1b / etc. or planning to file soon, <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/grant-uscis-case-tracker/id6450695507?mt=12\">Grant</a> can help you in your journey. The app is free for basic use - you can track up to 4 cases &amp; track case history. The other features are paid - for now I'm just hoping to cover my costs as it's a pretty niche app. My design &amp; privacy sensitivities prevented me from going the Ads route, even though that's what most apps use in the space. I'm happy to extend a free promo code for a free month to anyone who wants to try the extra features, just let me know in the comments (if you like the app &amp; don't like subscriptions, there's a lifetime purchase option!).</p>\n<p>Bonus: if you want to make Grant even more personal, you can <a href=\"https://getgrant.app/#custom-icons\">set your own customized icon</a> - choose from 9 extra icons I designed.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: I designed and built <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/grant-uscis-case-tracker/id6450695507?mt=12\">Grant</a> - a free app (with some paid features) to track &amp; manage your USCIS cases on macOS.</p>",

These are primarily used as my offline/local backups. Currently because NTFS for Mac is not working with my license, I only have read only access on the trial (which expires today). I refuse to buy another license from a company like this.</p>",

I found some great apps with nice interfaces and great functionality. Some are free, while others are reasonably priced.

When I switched from Windows to MacOS, one of the most painful things was to re-wire my brain that CTRL+X and CTRL+V would not work for everything as on Windows. After I gave up that I would not get use to it (because I keep on working with Windows machines) is when Command X came here to save me. This together with <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/change-the-behavior-of-the-modifier-keys-mchlp1011/mac\">modifier keys</a> natively on the Mac.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://clipgrab.org/\">ClibGrab</a> \u2013 FREE.

Saving you a lot of time.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://maccy.app/\">Maccy</a> \u2013 USD 10 (one time) This app gives you all the flexibility you need from a Clipboard Manager. Never again regret not pasting that thing you had on the clipboard, just check the whole clipboard history by pressing one button.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.videolan.org/vlc/\">VLC Player \u2013</a> FREE The VLC Player has been the multimedia player of choice of millions of people on Windows and Mac is not the exception. A classic that works very smoothly and offers a lot of benefits.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.audacityteam.org/\">Audacity</a> \u2013 FREE Recording audio doesn\u2019t have to be difficult, I\u00b4ve been using Audacity and creating MP3 files for video production or other use cases. Super simple and has a lot of funcionalities, effects, etc.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/photosweeper/id463362050?mt=12\">PhotoSweeper</a> \u2013 USD 10 (one time) I have a large amount of digital pictures that I\u00b4ve taken over the years.

But it had two major issues for me:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>There was no way to easily get your notes OUT OF Apple Notes</li>\n<li>There was no \"web clipper\" plugin that could scrape a web page and make it a Note</li>\n<li>It wasn't cross-platform (I needed Mac, iOS and Linux).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So, this sent me down a bit of a rabbit hole.</p>\n<h2>Joplin</h2>\n<p>I first tried Joplin. I liked the desktop app, but did not like the mobile app. The split view in the desktop app was less than appealing, but it was completely free. So I wasn't complaining.</p>\n<h2>Obsidian</h2>\n<p>I next tried Obsidian.  I liked the desktop app, but I hated the mobile app. Having the markdown hidden and only displayed when editing a line was a huge improvement. The plugin system was very nice. But the mobile app on my iPhone was pretty painful to use.</p>\n<h2>Loqseq</h2>\n<p>I dipped my toes in Logseq, but was not happy with how it worked, so I gave up on it pretty quickly. After watching a few lengthy videos, I realized it just wasn't for me.</p>\n<h2>Bear Notes</h2>\n<p>Next I tried Bear Notes.  I liked that it was Markdown-based. I liked the UI. The iOS apps were nice. The Markdown was hidden, just like in Obsidian. It even had a web clipper plugin. I bought a $15.00/year subscription and used it for a few months. The app wasn't cross platform. But at this point I owned a MacBook Pro, a Mac mini, an iPhone, an iPad, a Homepod mini and an Apple Watch. The need for a cross-platform solution didn't exist any more. As much as I liked Bear Notes, it had 2 problems:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It was not end-to-end encrypted even with Advanced Data Protection on.</li>\n<li>There was a subscription.  $15 a year was not a lot. But the price went up to $30 a year. I was grandfathered in. But still it was a subscription.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>fsnotes</h2>\n<p>fsnotes had a lot going for it.  It was markdown-based. It was open source and free, or you could buy it in the app store to support the developer. It had a nice preview mode. It was a fast native app that used iCloud Drive for syncing, so it was end-to-end encrypted if Advanced Data Protection was turned on.</p>\n<p>I used fsnotes for a good 6 months and was pretty happy with it, but:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>There was no web clipper for it.</li>\n<li>When you pasted text into it, it didn't auto-convert it into Markdown.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Upnote</h2>\n<p>Another interesting app.  This one IS cross platform, and you can subscribe or buy a \"lifetime subscription.\" The UI is very nice. The mobile apps are nice, and you get web clipper plugins.</p>\n<p>I signed up the $0.99/month subscription and imported my notes.  Overall a nice app, except:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The data is not end-to-end encrypted and they have no plans to support it.</li>\n<li>I run Fedora Silverblue which requires all apps be Flatpaks, and Upnote only offers their app as an AppImage and a Snap.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So, my #1 reason for checking out this app, the Linux support, didn't work for me.</p>\n<p>If you need a cross-platform note taking app, and don't care about end-to-end encryption, this is a solid choice.</p>\n<h2>Apple Notes</h2>\n<p>Now, after this long journey, I have all my notes in Apple Notes. Here is why:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Apple Notes is free. It comes with every Mac and every iPhone/iPad.</li>\n<li>Apple Notes is end-to-end encrypted if you have Advanced Data Protection turned on.</li>\n<li>My wife uses a Mac and iPhone too. So it's dead simple to share notes with her.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Here is how I worked around some of the limitations I had with Apple Notes.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>There is an app in the Mac App Store called Exporter. It will export ALL your Apple Notes, with attachments as Markdown. So, if you want to leave Apple Notes, it's a lot simpler to do so. I use Exporter once a week to export all my notes to Markdown and back them up to my NAS.</li>\n<li>The web clipper problem was easier than I thought. If I want to move a web page to Notes, I open it in Safari, click on the reader view icon. Then I press \u2318+A followed by \u2318+C to copy the whole page. Then I just paste it into a new note.  Everything comes over: formatting, images and link. Then I copy and paste the URL to the bottom of the page.</li>\n<li>As I said, my need for a cross-platform solution pretty much doesn't exist any more. But even if it does, I can easily open the Markdown file off my NAS. So I can at least see the data on another OS, even though I can't edit it.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I also get these two benefits:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>My notes are now end-to-end encrypted.</li>\n<li>I can easily share them with my wife.</li>\n<li>Notes lets you \"scan\" documents by taking pictures of them, cropping them, and dumping them directly into Notes.</li>\n<li>No subscription fees</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I'm done now. No reason to go anywhere else. Now I need to spend time building a personal knowledgebase rather than wasting time hopping around different notes applications.</p>\n<p>One thing this experience has taught me is the importance of open standards. I would not have been able to do this hopping around if I wasn't able to exports my notes into an open format such as Markdown, RTF or HTML. Kind of ironic, since I ended up with Apple Notes.</p>\n<p>Apple Notes will let you import RTF and HTML notes, so it's easy to get notes into it. And the exporter tool will let me get notes out of it. If Exporter goes away, so does my use of Apple Notes. That's why I am backing up weekly to Markdown.</p>\n<p>I did look at some cross-platform end-to-end encrypted notes apps such as Standard Notes. But Standard Notes was $90/year and it was the cheapest of the options I looked at. That was just way too expensive.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>This is my MY journey.  You may not like Apple Notes because of vendor lock in. But it is a credible choice with a nice feature set.</p>\n<p>If you've had a similar journey, please let me know your path and where you ended up.</p>",

And none of the available apps for folder organization utilized AI/LLMs and required manual configuration. That's why I made Sorted App.You can easily use your Open API key and select the folder you want to organize, and you're all set. It also has automatic sorting, which is especially helpful for your downloads folder. I have tested it for folder sizes as large as 2500 files and it has worked perfectly. Not going to lie, it has taken a ton of tweaking and optimizing.The files are only moved into other folders so there is no deleting of files.You can download it here at www.getsorted.ai</p>",

I'm Kushagra. I created LookAway after suffering from eye strain due to working for long hours staring at my screen.</p>\n<p>The app nudges you to take regular breaks by blurring the screen to help reduce eye strain. It gives a heads-up before each break so you can wrap up tasks, and you can adjust the break intervals and durations to fit your routine.</p>\n<p>LookAway is smart - it works when you work, pauses when you don't, and handles idle time intelligently. It also pauses automatically during calls or meetings. </p>\n<p>I\u2019d love to hear your feedback to improve it. Check it out at https://lookaway.app. Thank you for your time!</p>",

Bug and general user experience has been resolved, and I now have a sizable backlog of things to implement.</p>\n<p>In short - ScreenMemory is an app that takes screenshot of your screen(s) and then lets you rewind time to look back at it. Useful to see what you did during the day, track time if you're a freelancer or work, compare something you worked on, find lost information, etc. I have a lot of use cases on the website (<a href=\"https://screenmemory.app/\">https://screenmemory.app</a>).</p>\n<p>Here's the app in action, you can see I was working on things a couple of days ago between 2pm-3pm, and later 8.30pm-9.30pm (just as an illustration of how you can track time).</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/zlle34vkudwb1.png?width=2174&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7dd9898f971fc712a382ea3f1fc4b9174847bab9</p>\n<p>I read some quote today that, if you're not embarrassed by your 1.0 version, you've launched too late. I'm already at 1.5.1 but I'm still a bit embarrassed. I have features and polish to implement, but I figured I should at least launch somewhat 'officially' since it works really well.</p>\n<p>The app is paid, at <strong>$19</strong> currently. I am still not sure what the final price will be, suggestions are welcome. It is usable in free mode, with some heavy limitations but it should show how the app works for you to make a decision, at least.</p>\n<p>The website is here: <a href=\"https://screenmemory.app/\">https://screenmemory.app/</a> and it has <em>some</em> more info.</p>",

I'm really excited about a new product called <a href=\"https://www.pwr.builders/\">Project White Rabbit (PWR)</a>.</p>\n<p>I've been obsessing over the productivity space for years, and as I'm sure you've seen things have been picking up a lot this year because of all the AI progress. This is the first \"productivity\" app that I've started using regularly, because it's deeply integrated into my workflow. Curious what you all think of it, and if there are other similar products you use.</p>\n<p>PWR addresses a few problems:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you have a ton of browser tabs open, and you don't remember how they are connected to each other or which ones you still need</li>\n<li>your tabs are disconnected from each other and from all the notes and things you write</li>\n<li>you have to keep re-searching for things online, and don't remember what you've already seen</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A few reasons why I like it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>all my tabs and notes are embedded together, with the context I need</li>\n<li>helps me quickly group tabs, save the ones I want, and close the ones I don't need</li>\n<li>it's entirely private - your data never leaves your computer without your permission</li>\n<li>it's not just another chatGPT wrapper, but actually has some interesting AI under the hood (I've also followed product updates for a while and seems like there are some pretty useful AI features coming soon)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It's still in beta, but I still find it more than good enough for daily use. Hope you like it!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pwr.builders/\">https://www.pwr.builders</a> to download the Mac app and learn more</p>\n<p>PS - I also love the nods to The Matrix \ud83d\udd73\ufe0f\ud83d\udc07</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/in1abc4jdgvb1.png?width=1154&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b6f2478818b0c6f889e9931409e2c63f63b4e4fc</p>",

It\u2019s built for everyone (including me) who\u2019s got no video editing skills to create captivating tutorial, promo, sales, and demo videos in minutes.</p>\n<p>As a startup team, we know the struggle of needing high-quality product videos without breaking the bank. Hiring a professional can cost hundreds of $ for each video, and creating a just-so-so video ourselves consumes precious hours. It\u2019s a huge cost for us, either in terms of money or time.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s why we built FocuSee, hoping to make post-production easier, smoother, and as friendly as possible for non-professionals.</p>\n<p><strong>How it works?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Simply record your screen (with webcam and mic) as you usually do</li>\n<li>FocuSee automatically adds pan &amp; zoom effects, and a nice background. So <strong>once finishing recording, you'll have a video ready to shine</strong></li>\n<li>Export it as video/GIF locally, share it via a link, or embed it anywhere</li>\n<li>You can even add in-video quizzes, forms, and call-to-action buttons to generate leads or get feedback more efficiently. (This feature is available for videos shared online)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://reddit.com/link/17bfz41/video/yf1zj9mpz4vb1/player\">FocuSee Demo Video</a></p>\n<p>Also, you can make personalized adjustments easily:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add extra highlights to focal points with Spotlight to draw the audience's attention</li>\n<li>Choose the selfie and screen layout based on your use case: side-by-side, overlay, or screen-only</li>\n<li>Pick from 8 mouse cursor styles and 3 button click effects to match your video's style</li>\n<li>Change the background, rounded corners, shadow, inset, and padding as you like</li>\n<li>And more\u2026</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We're offering a <a href=\"https://gemoo.com/focusee/\">free trial</a> for both Windows and Mac, with which you can explore all features and export one watermarked video for free. Your feedback is gold to us, and we'd be highly grateful for your insights.</p>\n<p>If you find FocuSee useful, please let me know, and I\u2019d love to offer you an additional 30% off exclusive discount on top of our current early bird offer, as a reward for your support!</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance!</p>",

I know there are sooooo many apps of the same kind, so I thought it was out of date. But recently when I want to use inline input function (which is to input the answer got in the first round with AI to the cursor position), I found that there is nearly no one easy to use. It's in the first week of October and I updated my app to support this function. </p>\n<p>I feel disappointed at the situation that we are so impressed by the fact that AI tools are just ENOUGH, but when we take a closer look at it, we will find the useful ones are still in need. I will pick some to show you as for inline input function: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>MacGPT can do this, but it cannot let users to define the HOST/ENDPOINT</li>\n<li>PopClip: same as above</li>\n<li>BoltAI: can do this and can customize HOST/ENDPOINT, but is paid for $29</li>\n<li>Notion or Obsidian extension? Notion is paid and I don't know if Obsidian extension can do both.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I do think the apps above are quite good apps and I adore them. But I just want this function with customizable HOST/ENDPOINT and in a fair price, better to be free. So to this point, I think Broccoli can do what I need and if you are in search of a similar one, maybe you can try my app! So I'm here~</p>\n<p>What is good about Broccoli\ud83e\udd66:\n- The tool is free, although you might need to use the paid service from OpenAI\n- You can customize the HOST/ENDPOINT to a third party provider of OpenAI service\n- After you use the inline input, you can choose whether to continue asking in the chat window (don't forget to choose remember history), which is not supported by most apps (I need that so I added it)\n- There are so many basic functions that you might like, including reading a TXT or DOCX file\n- And I'm very proud that I made its UI animation different from most apps, which can float on every space</p>\n<p>I will paste the link here and I will appreciated it if you come to see my work\ud83d\ude0a</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Ryan-the-hito/Broccoli\">GitHub</a></p>\n<p>PS: The GitHub page is basically Chinese and I'm a student in university working on my dissertation right now. So I will update it into English when I get rid of the papers...\ud83e\udd72</p>",

More actions are available by right clicking on the thumbnail.</p>\n<p>Clop is also better at batch processing now. You can drop a lot of files on it, and it will show them in a scrollable <strong>Compact Results</strong> layout.</p>\n<p>There's also a CLI in case you liked that from ImageOptim. You can <code>clop optimise &lt;files-or-folder&gt;</code> from the Terminal now.</p>",

My 2016 model is painfully slow (in general) but on my 2022 M1 it's super snappy even with a lot of history. All data is local, in fact the app is sandboxed so it does not even have internet connection capabilities.</p>\n<p>(I have a basic image-text-search working, but not in the beta)</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>If someone would like to try the beta and give feedback, please DM me and I will send you an invite code to download from the App Store beta page.</p>",

So I've been looking into the state of the art for Acrobat alternatives for Mac, and have been pleasantly surprised that there are a few decent alternatives that could actually satisfy most of my needs without costing a whole lot. (It helps that I am an educator and there are decent educator discounts, too.)</p>\n<p>I've seen other threads on here about PDF apps but they were mostly out of date and none quite tailored to my specific needs, so I thought I'd start another one and see what people thought. </p>\n<p>To define \"my needs\": 1. I read a lot of PDFs, many of which are not-great image scans of historical documents that can be hundreds of pages long; 2. I need to OCR them (and am of course aware of the limitations of all OCR on these kinds of sources); 3. I need to be able to highlight parts and quickly find my highlights; 4. I need to be able to search through large documents very quickly; 5. I also need to be able to fill out forms and sign documents on a regular basis. </p>\n<p>With that in mind, I've been looking at the trial versions of PDF Studio, PDF Expert and Nitro PDF Pro (formerly PDFpen). My basic take-away right now is that PDF Expert is a very slick product. It is VERY fast \u2014 much faster than PDF Studio for just about everything. PDF Studio is pretty slow to search and its OCR is the same speed as Acrobat's, which is slow. As a point of comparison, it seemed like PDF Studio took about 5-6X longer to OCR a page than PDF Expert does on my Macbook Pro, and I suspect it is because PDF Expert makes better using of multithreading, and this is with PDF Expert on \"accurate\" OCR mode (as opposed to one more optimized for speed). PDF Expert's OCR did a lot better with my sample documents than PDF Studio did, and I <em>love</em> the \"see what the OCR text actually is and correct it\" feature (if anything, I love it a little too much, and spend too much time obsessively correcting the OCR). Nitro PDF seems to be somewhere in between the two of them in terms of speed.</p>\n<p>As an experiment, I ran all of them OCR on a not-great, not-terrible document scan. <a href=\"https://imgur.com/Lui3ygx\">Here is the original</a>. This is a scan from a microfilm version of a typed document, so it has the advantage of being high-contrast, but that also means that some of the letter texture is degraded. PDF Studio took about 5-6 seconds to render <a href=\"https://imgur.com/879Kb4i\">this OCR</a> (as visualized in PDF Expert), and you can see it is NOT that impressive. Nitro PDF was a little faster, and came up with <a href=\"https://imgur.com/XXZnOGA\">this</a>, which is about the same.</p>\n<p>PDF Expert took about 1 second to render <a href=\"https://imgur.com/caH0p84\">this version</a>, which still has errors but is MUCH more coherent than the other one. I am especially impressed that it got the weird \"TOP SECRET\" stamp (which is both outlined, at a weird angle compared to the rest of the text, and has a line through it), as well as some of the partial words in the text (like the \"period\" where the \"p\" was halfway cut off, or the \"Washington\" where the \"W\" is missing a lot of lines). </p>\n<p>EDIT: I also gave PDF Reader Pro a quick try, and it came up <a href=\"https://imgur.com/rnKndOJ\">with this</a>, which is probably the best in terms of text, even if the positioning is weird. It was reasonably fast \u2014\u00a02 seconds or so. The weird bits are that you apparently have to run it and export the document to a new file, which I find an annoyance, and you can't actually see the progress when you OCR an entire document (you get a spinner until it is done), which is just... dumb. And suggests to me that the developers don't use OCR themselves, ever.</p>\n<p>I also think that PDF Expert just looks and feels a lot better than PDF Studio. The latter does not feel like a Mac app, and that is not, you know, a <em>huge</em> deal, and I'll adjust to whatever, but it's a noticeable difference. PDF Studio has a lot of visual clutter. Turning off the ribbon helped a bit, but it is still a very clunky looking application \u2014 it has that crude UI that so many applications written in Java have. PDF Studio also just renders pages more slowly \u2014 fast-enough to use, but it is annoying to watch it refresh every time I go to a new page. Nitro PDF looks like a native Mac app \u2014 sort of like Preview \u2014 which is totally fine and unobjectionable. It is fast to render pages. </p>\n<p>PDF Expert also has a function that I have been DREAMING of for years, where it can (nearly instantly) render a color document scan into black-and-white. As someone who deals with a lot of photographed documents, this would be VERY helpful. Its \"remove distortion\" setting is also kind of magical. As an example, here's a <a href=\"https://imgur.com/qBhZv6u\">before</a> and <a href=\"https://imgur.com/ZCrZCbx\">after</a> of the kind of thing I'm talking about. Just a very noticeable improvement. The only downside to this is that there seems to be no way to adjust the settings for contrast, threshold, etc. \u2014 I really wish there were little knobs I could tinker with to get it \"perfect\" for any given PDF. PDF Studio has a \"Fix Scan\" option that can do some de-noise and de-speckle work, but the output looks pretty bad (just a muddy version of the original) and is very slow (and with no preview, so finding the right settings requires re-running it again and again).  Nitro PDF has a few relevant functions \u2014 a \"resample\" feature that lets you change the image contrast (but no preview ability), and a \"deskew and adjust\" feature that lets you manually change exposure and contrast settings (it does preview, but it is irritatingly slow) \u2014 but none as easy or as automatic. </p>\n<p>So, so far I am leaning in favor of PDF Expert. The argument against it is that it is lacking a few very significant features. For one, I don't think there's any way to easily batch OCR a lot of files with PDF Expert, except by trying to automate it with some other tool (like Automator or AppleScript). That's kind of a bummer, because I sometimes have need for OCRing a whole directory of PDFs. PDF Studio has all sorts of Batch tools that could occasionally come in handy, including batch OCR, resize, and so on. Nitro PDF also has a way to run it on a lot of PDFs at once, too. (EDIT: PDF Studio Pro does not seem to have a Batch OCR feature, which is too bad, as that might have tipped me in favor of it, and is an odd omission given that it has several other Batch features. It also lacks any ability to clean up the page images at all.)</p>\n<p>PDF Studio and Nitro PDF also seem to support cryptographically-secure document signatures, whereas PDF Expert lets you paste in a signature \u2014 but I think it's just an image. Does that matter? I'm not sure anymore. These days, the only documents where anybody seems to truly care about that kind of thing (e.g. legal documents) are always sent to me through DocuSign anyway, so maybe it's become a non-issue. </p>\n<p>PDF Studio and Nitro PDF have a lot of other Acrobat-like features, like the ability to create forms and add headers and footers and so on. I'm sure other people have needs for those things, but I don't, so those don't do anything for me. </p>\n<p>Anyway. As you can see, I'm leaning towards PDF Expert, even if I wish it did a few more things. The speed and ease of use of it just outweighs the extra features of PDF Studio, and its OCR and document editing just blow everything else out of the water. What's the point of batch OCR if the OCR is going to be crap? Better to figure out an Automator solution with PDF Expert than waste time and money on slow, crap OCR. Nitro PDF seems better than PDF Studio in most respects, but it still fails in the main one that matters to me \u2014 fast, good OCR \u2014 and so that probably will be the determinant. </p>\n<p>In terms of cost, PDF Expert is $80/year (50% off for students and educators) or $140 one-time. PDF Studio Standard is $99, Pro is $140 (and the Batch OCR is a Pro feature); there is a 50% discount for students and educators. So basically similar pricing for both. I am a little allergic to software subscriptions, but $40/year is not that bad, especially since I would have to use it for over 3 years for the one-time price to be justified, and who knows what the best software choice will be in 3 years? </p>\n<p>Nitro is $180 if I want \"extra features\" like OCR, and requires an additional $10/mo. subscription to sign documents. There is no educator discount that I can see, so that makes it way more expensive in my case. </p>\n<p>EDIT: PDF Reader Pro is $80 (one-time) if you want to be able to OCR things, 50% educator discount. </p>\n<p>I'm curious if other people have thoughts about this, or if there is something out there that blows these out of the water that I'm missing. My big take-away is that there are totally viable alternatives to Acrobat, which is positive no matter what.</p></div>",
