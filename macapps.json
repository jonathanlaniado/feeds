I found some great apps with nice interfaces and great functionality. Some are free, while others are reasonably priced. I will list the ones I like the most here, but ideally it would be awesome if you can also share your recommendations too \ud83d\ude09</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/command-x/id6448461551?mt=12\">Command X</a> \u2013 FREE. When I switched from Windows to MacOS, one of the most painful things was to re-wire my brain that CTRL+X and CTRL+V would not work for everything as on Windows. After I gave up that I would not get use to it (because I keep on working with Windows machines) is when Command X came here to save me. This together with <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/change-the-behavior-of-the-modifier-keys-mchlp1011/mac\">modifier keys</a> natively on the Mac.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://clipgrab.org/\">ClibGrab</a> \u2013 FREE.

Saving you a lot of time.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://maccy.app/\">Maccy</a> \u2013 USD 10 (one time) This app gives you all the flexibility you need from a Clipboard Manager. Never again regret not pasting that thing you had on the clipboard, just check the whole clipboard history by pressing one button.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.videolan.org/vlc/\">VLC Player \u2013</a> FREE The VLC Player has been the multimedia player of choice of millions of people on Windows and Mac is not the exception. A classic that works very smoothly and offers a lot of benefits.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.audacityteam.org/\">Audacity</a> \u2013 FREE Recording audio doesn\u2019t have to be difficult, I\u00b4ve been using Audacity and creating MP3 files for video production or other use cases. Super simple and has a lot of funcionalities, effects, etc.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/photosweeper/id463362050?mt=12\">PhotoSweeper</a> \u2013 USD 10 (one time) I have a large amount of digital pictures that I\u00b4ve taken over the years.

But it had two major issues for me:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>There was no way to easily get your notes OUT OF Apple Notes</li>\n<li>There was no \"web clipper\" plugin that could scrape a web page and make it a Note</li>\n<li>It wasn't cross-platform (I needed Mac, iOS and Linux).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So, this sent me down a bit of a rabbit hole.</p>\n<h2>Joplin</h2>\n<p>I first tried Joplin. I liked the desktop app, but did not like the mobile app. The split view in the desktop app was less than appealing, but it was completely free. So I wasn't complaining.</p>\n<h2>Obsidian</h2>\n<p>I next tried Obsidian.  I liked the desktop app, but I hated the mobile app. Having the markdown hidden and only displayed when editing a line was a huge improvement. The plugin system was very nice. But the mobile app on my iPhone was pretty painful to use.</p>\n<h2>Loqseq</h2>\n<p>I dipped my toes in Logseq, but was not happy with how it worked, so I gave up on it pretty quickly. After watching a few lengthy videos, I realized it just wasn't for me.</p>\n<h2>Bear Notes</h2>\n<p>Next I tried Bear Notes.  I liked that it was Markdown-based. I liked the UI. The iOS apps were nice. The Markdown was hidden, just like in Obsidian. It even had a web clipper plugin. I bought a $15.00/year subscription and used it for a few months. The app wasn't cross platform. But at this point I owned a MacBook Pro, a Mac mini, an iPhone, an iPad, a Homepod mini and an Apple Watch. The need for a cross-platform solution didn't exist any more. As much as I liked Bear Notes, it had 2 problems:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It was not end-to-end encrypted even with Advanced Data Protection on.</li>\n<li>There was a subscription.  $15 a year was not a lot. But the price went up to $30 a year. I was grandfathered in. But still it was a subscription.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>fsnotes</h2>\n<p>fsnotes had a lot going for it.  It was markdown-based. It was open source and free, or you could buy it in the app store to support the developer. It had a nice preview mode. It was a fast native app that used iCloud Drive for syncing, so it was end-to-end encrypted if Advanced Data Protection was turned on.</p>\n<p>I used fsnotes for a good 6 months and was pretty happy with it, but:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>There was no web clipper for it.</li>\n<li>When you pasted text into it, it didn't auto-convert it into Markdown.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Upnote</h2>\n<p>Another interesting app.  This one IS cross platform, and you can subscribe or buy a \"lifetime subscription.\" The UI is very nice. The mobile apps are nice, and you get web clipper plugins.</p>\n<p>I signed up the $0.99/month subscription and imported my notes.  Overall a nice app, except:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The data is not end-to-end encrypted and they have no plans to support it.</li>\n<li>I run Fedora Silverblue which requires all apps be Flatpaks, and Upnote only offers their app as an AppImage and a Snap.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So, my #1 reason for checking out this app, the Linux support, didn't work for me.</p>\n<p>If you need a cross-platform note taking app, and don't care about end-to-end encryption, this is a solid choice.</p>\n<h2>Apple Notes</h2>\n<p>Now, after this long journey, I have all my notes in Apple Notes. Here is why:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Apple Notes is free. It comes with every Mac and every iPhone/iPad.</li>\n<li>Apple Notes is end-to-end encrypted if you have Advanced Data Protection turned on.</li>\n<li>My wife uses a Mac and iPhone too. So it's dead simple to share notes with her.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Here is how I worked around some of the limitations I had with Apple Notes.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>There is an app in the Mac App Store called Exporter. It will export ALL your Apple Notes, with attachments as Markdown. So, if you want to leave Apple Notes, it's a lot simpler to do so. I use Exporter once a week to export all my notes to Markdown and back them up to my NAS.</li>\n<li>The web clipper problem was easier than I thought. If I want to move a web page to Notes, I open it in Safari, click on the reader view icon. Then I press \u2318+A followed by \u2318+C to copy the whole page. Then I just paste it into a new note.  Everything comes over: formatting, images and link. Then I copy and paste the URL to the bottom of the page.</li>\n<li>As I said, my need for a cross-platform solution pretty much doesn't exist any more. But even if it does, I can easily open the Markdown file off my NAS. So I can at least see the data on another OS, even though I can't edit it.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I also get these two benefits:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>My notes are now end-to-end encrypted.</li>\n<li>I can easily share them with my wife.</li>\n<li>Notes lets you \"scan\" documents by taking pictures of them, cropping them, and dumping them directly into Notes.</li>\n<li>No subscription fees</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I'm done now. No reason to go anywhere else. Now I need to spend time building a personal knowledgebase rather than wasting time hopping around different notes applications.</p>\n<p>One thing this experience has taught me is the importance of open standards. I would not have been able to do this hopping around if I wasn't able to exports my notes into an open format such as Markdown, RTF or HTML. Kind of ironic, since I ended up with Apple Notes.</p>\n<p>Apple Notes will let you import RTF and HTML notes, so it's easy to get notes into it. And the exporter tool will let me get notes out of it. If Exporter goes away, so does my use of Apple Notes. That's why I am backing up weekly to Markdown.</p>\n<p>I did look at some cross-platform end-to-end encrypted notes apps such as Standard Notes. But Standard Notes was $90/year and it was the cheapest of the options I looked at. That was just way too expensive.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>This is my MY journey.  You may not like Apple Notes because of vendor lock in. But it is a credible choice with a nice feature set.</p>\n<p>If you've had a similar journey, please let me know your path and where you ended up.</p>",

And none of the available apps for folder organization utilized AI/LLMs and required manual configuration. That's why I made Sorted App.You can easily use your Open API key and select the folder you want to organize, and you're all set. It also has automatic sorting, which is especially helpful for your downloads folder. I have tested it for folder sizes as large as 2500 files and it has worked perfectly. Not going to lie, it has taken a ton of tweaking and optimizing.The files are only moved into other folders so there is no deleting of files.You can download it here at www.getsorted.ai</p>",

I'm Kushagra. I created LookAway after suffering from eye strain due to working for long hours staring at my screen.</p>\n<p>The app nudges you to take regular breaks by blurring the screen to help reduce eye strain. It gives a heads-up before each break so you can wrap up tasks, and you can adjust the break intervals and durations to fit your routine.</p>\n<p>LookAway is smart - it works when you work, pauses when you don't, and handles idle time intelligently. It also pauses automatically during calls or meetings. </p>\n<p>I\u2019d love to hear your feedback to improve it. Check it out at https://lookaway.app. Thank you for your time!</p>",

Bug and general user experience has been resolved, and I now have a sizable backlog of things to implement.</p>\n<p>In short - ScreenMemory is an app that takes screenshot of your screen(s) and then lets you rewind time to look back at it. Useful to see what you did during the day, track time if you're a freelancer or work, compare something you worked on, find lost information, etc. I have a lot of use cases on the website (<a href=\"https://screenmemory.app/\">https://screenmemory.app</a>).</p>\n<p>Here's the app in action, you can see I was working on things a couple of days ago between 2pm-3pm, and later 8.30pm-9.30pm (just as an illustration of how you can track time).</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/zlle34vkudwb1.png?width=2174&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7dd9898f971fc712a382ea3f1fc4b9174847bab9</p>\n<p>I read some quote today that, if you're not embarrassed by your 1.0 version, you've launched too late. I'm already at 1.5.1 but I'm still a bit embarrassed. I have features and polish to implement, but I figured I should at least launch somewhat 'officially' since it works really well.</p>\n<p>The app is paid, at <strong>$19</strong> currently. I am still not sure what the final price will be, suggestions are welcome. It is usable in free mode, with some heavy limitations but it should show how the app works for you to make a decision, at least.</p>\n<p>The website is here: <a href=\"https://screenmemory.app/\">https://screenmemory.app/</a> and it has <em>some</em> more info.</p>",

I'm really excited about a new product called <a href=\"https://www.pwr.builders/\">Project White Rabbit (PWR)</a>.</p>\n<p>I've been obsessing over the productivity space for years, and as I'm sure you've seen things have been picking up a lot this year because of all the AI progress. This is the first \"productivity\" app that I've started using regularly, because it's deeply integrated into my workflow. Curious what you all think of it, and if there are other similar products you use.</p>\n<p>PWR addresses a few problems:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you have a ton of browser tabs open, and you don't remember how they are connected to each other or which ones you still need</li>\n<li>your tabs are disconnected from each other and from all the notes and things you write</li>\n<li>you have to keep re-searching for things online, and don't remember what you've already seen</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A few reasons why I like it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>all my tabs and notes are embedded together, with the context I need</li>\n<li>helps me quickly group tabs, save the ones I want, and close the ones I don't need</li>\n<li>it's entirely private - your data never leaves your computer without your permission</li>\n<li>it's not just another chatGPT wrapper, but actually has some interesting AI under the hood (I've also followed product updates for a while and seems like there are some pretty useful AI features coming soon)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It's still in beta, but I still find it more than good enough for daily use. Hope you like it!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pwr.builders/\">https://www.pwr.builders</a> to download the Mac app and learn more</p>\n<p>PS - I also love the nods to The Matrix \ud83d\udd73\ufe0f\ud83d\udc07</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/in1abc4jdgvb1.png?width=1154&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b6f2478818b0c6f889e9931409e2c63f63b4e4fc</p>",

It\u2019s built for everyone (including me) who\u2019s got no video editing skills to create captivating tutorial, promo, sales, and demo videos in minutes.</p>\n<p>As a startup team, we know the struggle of needing high-quality product videos without breaking the bank. Hiring a professional can cost hundreds of $ for each video, and creating a just-so-so video ourselves consumes precious hours. It\u2019s a huge cost for us, either in terms of money or time.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s why we built FocuSee, hoping to make post-production easier, smoother, and as friendly as possible for non-professionals.</p>\n<p><strong>How it works?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Simply record your screen (with webcam and mic) as you usually do</li>\n<li>FocuSee automatically adds pan &amp; zoom effects, and a nice background. So <strong>once finishing recording, you'll have a video ready to shine</strong></li>\n<li>Export it as video/GIF locally, share it via a link, or embed it anywhere</li>\n<li>You can even add in-video quizzes, forms, and call-to-action buttons to generate leads or get feedback more efficiently. (This feature is available for videos shared online)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://reddit.com/link/17bfz41/video/yf1zj9mpz4vb1/player\">FocuSee Demo Video</a></p>\n<p>Also, you can make personalized adjustments easily:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add extra highlights to focal points with Spotlight to draw the audience's attention</li>\n<li>Choose the selfie and screen layout based on your use case: side-by-side, overlay, or screen-only</li>\n<li>Pick from 8 mouse cursor styles and 3 button click effects to match your video's style</li>\n<li>Change the background, rounded corners, shadow, inset, and padding as you like</li>\n<li>And more\u2026</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We're offering a <a href=\"https://gemoo.com/focusee/\">free trial</a> for both Windows and Mac, with which you can explore all features and export one watermarked video for free. Your feedback is gold to us, and we'd be highly grateful for your insights.</p>\n<p>If you find FocuSee useful, please let me know, and I\u2019d love to offer you an additional 30% off exclusive discount on top of our current early bird offer, as a reward for your support!</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance!</p>",

I know there are sooooo many apps of the same kind, so I thought it was out of date. But recently when I want to use inline input function (which is to input the answer got in the first round with AI to the cursor position), I found that there is nearly no one easy to use. It's in the first week of October and I updated my app to support this function. </p>\n<p>I feel disappointed at the situation that we are so impressed by the fact that AI tools are just ENOUGH, but when we take a closer look at it, we will find the useful ones are still in need. I will pick some to show you as for inline input function: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>MacGPT can do this, but it cannot let users to define the HOST/ENDPOINT</li>\n<li>PopClip: same as above</li>\n<li>BoltAI: can do this and can customize HOST/ENDPOINT, but is paid for $29</li>\n<li>Notion or Obsidian extension? Notion is paid and I don't know if Obsidian extension can do both.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I do think the apps above are quite good apps and I adore them. But I just want this function with customizable HOST/ENDPOINT and in a fair price, better to be free. So to this point, I think Broccoli can do what I need and if you are in search of a similar one, maybe you can try my app! So I'm here~</p>\n<p>What is good about Broccoli\ud83e\udd66:\n- The tool is free, although you might need to use the paid service from OpenAI\n- You can customize the HOST/ENDPOINT to a third party provider of OpenAI service\n- After you use the inline input, you can choose whether to continue asking in the chat window (don't forget to choose remember history), which is not supported by most apps (I need that so I added it)\n- There are so many basic functions that you might like, including reading a TXT or DOCX file\n- And I'm very proud that I made its UI animation different from most apps, which can float on every space</p>\n<p>I will paste the link here and I will appreciated it if you come to see my work\ud83d\ude0a</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Ryan-the-hito/Broccoli\">GitHub</a></p>\n<p>PS: The GitHub page is basically Chinese and I'm a student in university working on my dissertation right now. So I will update it into English when I get rid of the papers...\ud83e\udd72</p>",

It can also downscale the files or crop them to a specific size.</p>\n<p>About 1 month ago I asked people around here to tell me about how they use Clop and how it could be better.</p>\n<p>Clop v2.2 is a month-long work of bringing those features that people asked for. I'll mention people below with the changes respective to their requests.</p>\n<p><strong>Note: the auto update is pretty subtle to not annoy people, check the menubar icon to see if v2.2.0 is available</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<p>/u/raaamyaraaavan and /u/RavenHD</p>\n<p>There's now a way to automatically rename the image based on a template.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There is also a setting to only copy the image, without the path</li>\n<li>Above the thumbnail there is a name editor as well: click, edit, press <code>Enter</code> to rename</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://files.lowtechguys.com/clop_2023-10-09_318.png\">screenshot of image path settings</a></p>\n<p>/u/raaamyaraaavan: No watermarks yet, it's on the todo list. Although you could create it yourself using the new Automation feature of Clop.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>/u/raulaspern</p>\n<p>I know you wanted automatically optimising Yoink files, I might have something better.</p>\n<p>There is now a <strong>Compact Results</strong> layout option where instead of large thumbnails, Clop can show a more compact list of draggable optimised files. </p>\n<p>You can configure Clop to dismiss results after dragging so it works similar to Yoink.</p>\n<p>There's also a drop zone in Clop, so you can start dragging an image and drop it in Clop's zone instead of in Yoink for the same effect.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://files.lowtechguys.com/clop_2023-10-09_327.jpeg\">screenshot of Compact Results</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>/u/tanerilyazov</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Smart Cropping is now implemented. Click on the resolution text to select from preset sizes (or enter your own)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://files.lowtechguys.com/clop_2023-10-09_331.png\">screenshot of cropping sizes</a></p>\n<p>You can also automate this based on the path of the file if you do this often: <a href=\"https://files.lowtechguys.com/clop_2023-10-09_361.png\">screenshot of automating slack emoji cropping</a> </p>\n<hr />\n<p>/u/areyouredditenough  /u/AShortcuts  /u/epedreno  /u/montereysand</p>\n<ul>\n<li>PDF optimisation is now integrated<ul>\n<li>you can now drop PDFs in the Clop drop zone for manual optimisation</li>\n<li>you can also setup Clop to watch specific folders for PDFs to appear and optimise them automatically \nClop uses the same utility and settings that Optimage uses so the result is close to \"as optimised as possible\".</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p>/u/areyouredditenough about the presets idea:</p>\n<p>Presets can be \"simulated\" by using the new Automations feature: you can create a macOS Shortcut to do whatever you want with the image/video/PDF, and then you can assign that Shortcut to run automatically on optimised images based on their path.</p>\n<p>For example you can have an <strong>Add watermark and crop to 512x512</strong> shortcut that you can assign to images being saved into <code>~/Desktop/Watermarked</code>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>/u/JothamLEC</p>\n<ul>\n<li>copying more than one image will not trigger optimisation anymore</li>\n<li>red and blue text have been adjusted to a more readable color palette</li>\n<li>the CleanShot error should now appear as an \"Already optimised\" notice instead</li>\n</ul>\n<p>/u/haitashe</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Custom Sizes are there now, although they don't have keybinds yet: <a href=\"https://files.lowtechguys.com/clop_2023-10-09_331.png\">screenshot of cropping sizes</a></li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p>/u/Lecter  /u/mazakiss</p>\n<p>Uploading to Backblaze is supported through a Shortcut now. </p>\n<p>It's a bit convoluted, but after the initial setup it works without any hitch and can also be set to upload automatically based on the file path.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://files.lowtechguys.com/clop_2023-10-09_362.jpeg\">screenshot of using the Upload to Backblaze automation</a></p>\n<p>It can also be used to upload files manually by right clicking the thumbnail: <a href=\"https://files.lowtechguys.com/clop_2023-10-09_363.jpeg\">screenshot of right click menu</a></p>\n<p>I'm hoping to integrate with <a href=\"https://dropshare.app/\">Dropshare</a> soon to make this easier to use and have support for more types of upload.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>/u/Professional-Ad7841</p>\n<p>Clop now replaces the original file with the optimised one, and there are settings to control this behaviour.</p>\n<p>The thumbnail can also be saved as a file (hover over it and press <code>Cmd</code>-<code>S</code>), copied to clipboard (<code>Cmd</code>-<code>C</code>), shown in Finder (<code>Cmd</code>-<code>F</code>). More actions are available by right clicking on the thumbnail.</p>\n<p>Clop is also better at batch processing now. You can drop a lot of files on it, and it will show them in a scrollable <strong>Compact Results</strong> layout.</p>\n<p>There's also a CLI in case you liked that from ImageOptim. You can <code>clop optimise &lt;files-or-folder&gt;</code> from the Terminal now.</p>",

My 2016 model is painfully slow (in general) but on my 2022 M1 it's super snappy even with a lot of history. All data is local, in fact the app is sandboxed so it does not even have internet connection capabilities.</p>\n<p>(I have a basic image-text-search working, but not in the beta)</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>If someone would like to try the beta and give feedback, please DM me and I will send you an invite code to download from the App Store beta page.</p>",

So I've been looking into the state of the art for Acrobat alternatives for Mac, and have been pleasantly surprised that there are a few decent alternatives that could actually satisfy most of my needs without costing a whole lot. (It helps that I am an educator and there are decent educator discounts, too.)</p>\n<p>I've seen other threads on here about PDF apps but they were mostly out of date and none quite tailored to my specific needs, so I thought I'd start another one and see what people thought. </p>\n<p>To define \"my needs\": 1. I read a lot of PDFs, many of which are not-great image scans of historical documents that can be hundreds of pages long; 2. I need to OCR them (and am of course aware of the limitations of all OCR on these kinds of sources); 3. I need to be able to highlight parts and quickly find my highlights; 4. I need to be able to search through large documents very quickly; 5. I also need to be able to fill out forms and sign documents on a regular basis. </p>\n<p>With that in mind, I've been looking at the trial versions of PDF Studio, PDF Expert and Nitro PDF Pro (formerly PDFpen). My basic take-away right now is that PDF Expert is a very slick product. It is VERY fast \u2014 much faster than PDF Studio for just about everything. PDF Studio is pretty slow to search and its OCR is the same speed as Acrobat's, which is slow. As a point of comparison, it seemed like PDF Studio took about 5-6X longer to OCR a page than PDF Expert does on my Macbook Pro, and I suspect it is because PDF Expert makes better using of multithreading, and this is with PDF Expert on \"accurate\" OCR mode (as opposed to one more optimized for speed). PDF Expert's OCR did a lot better with my sample documents than PDF Studio did, and I <em>love</em> the \"see what the OCR text actually is and correct it\" feature (if anything, I love it a little too much, and spend too much time obsessively correcting the OCR). Nitro PDF seems to be somewhere in between the two of them in terms of speed.</p>\n<p>As an experiment, I ran all of them OCR on a not-great, not-terrible document scan. <a href=\"https://imgur.com/Lui3ygx\">Here is the original</a>. This is a scan from a microfilm version of a typed document, so it has the advantage of being high-contrast, but that also means that some of the letter texture is degraded. PDF Studio took about 5-6 seconds to render <a href=\"https://imgur.com/879Kb4i\">this OCR</a> (as visualized in PDF Expert), and you can see it is NOT that impressive. Nitro PDF was a little faster, and came up with <a href=\"https://imgur.com/XXZnOGA\">this</a>, which is about the same.</p>\n<p>PDF Expert took about 1 second to render <a href=\"https://imgur.com/caH0p84\">this version</a>, which still has errors but is MUCH more coherent than the other one. I am especially impressed that it got the weird \"TOP SECRET\" stamp (which is both outlined, at a weird angle compared to the rest of the text, and has a line through it), as well as some of the partial words in the text (like the \"period\" where the \"p\" was halfway cut off, or the \"Washington\" where the \"W\" is missing a lot of lines). </p>\n<p>EDIT: I also gave PDF Reader Pro a quick try, and it came up <a href=\"https://imgur.com/rnKndOJ\">with this</a>, which is probably the best in terms of text, even if the positioning is weird. It was reasonably fast \u2014\u00a02 seconds or so. The weird bits are that you apparently have to run it and export the document to a new file, which I find an annoyance, and you can't actually see the progress when you OCR an entire document (you get a spinner until it is done), which is just... dumb. And suggests to me that the developers don't use OCR themselves, ever.</p>\n<p>I also think that PDF Expert just looks and feels a lot better than PDF Studio. The latter does not feel like a Mac app, and that is not, you know, a <em>huge</em> deal, and I'll adjust to whatever, but it's a noticeable difference. PDF Studio has a lot of visual clutter. Turning off the ribbon helped a bit, but it is still a very clunky looking application \u2014 it has that crude UI that so many applications written in Java have. PDF Studio also just renders pages more slowly \u2014 fast-enough to use, but it is annoying to watch it refresh every time I go to a new page. Nitro PDF looks like a native Mac app \u2014 sort of like Preview \u2014 which is totally fine and unobjectionable. It is fast to render pages. </p>\n<p>PDF Expert also has a function that I have been DREAMING of for years, where it can (nearly instantly) render a color document scan into black-and-white. As someone who deals with a lot of photographed documents, this would be VERY helpful. Its \"remove distortion\" setting is also kind of magical. As an example, here's a <a href=\"https://imgur.com/qBhZv6u\">before</a> and <a href=\"https://imgur.com/ZCrZCbx\">after</a> of the kind of thing I'm talking about. Just a very noticeable improvement. The only downside to this is that there seems to be no way to adjust the settings for contrast, threshold, etc. \u2014 I really wish there were little knobs I could tinker with to get it \"perfect\" for any given PDF. PDF Studio has a \"Fix Scan\" option that can do some de-noise and de-speckle work, but the output looks pretty bad (just a muddy version of the original) and is very slow (and with no preview, so finding the right settings requires re-running it again and again).  Nitro PDF has a few relevant functions \u2014 a \"resample\" feature that lets you change the image contrast (but no preview ability), and a \"deskew and adjust\" feature that lets you manually change exposure and contrast settings (it does preview, but it is irritatingly slow) \u2014 but none as easy or as automatic. </p>\n<p>So, so far I am leaning in favor of PDF Expert. The argument against it is that it is lacking a few very significant features. For one, I don't think there's any way to easily batch OCR a lot of files with PDF Expert, except by trying to automate it with some other tool (like Automator or AppleScript). That's kind of a bummer, because I sometimes have need for OCRing a whole directory of PDFs. PDF Studio has all sorts of Batch tools that could occasionally come in handy, including batch OCR, resize, and so on. Nitro PDF also has a way to run it on a lot of PDFs at once, too. (EDIT: PDF Studio Pro does not seem to have a Batch OCR feature, which is too bad, as that might have tipped me in favor of it, and is an odd omission given that it has several other Batch features. It also lacks any ability to clean up the page images at all.)</p>\n<p>PDF Studio and Nitro PDF also seem to support cryptographically-secure document signatures, whereas PDF Expert lets you paste in a signature \u2014 but I think it's just an image. Does that matter? I'm not sure anymore. These days, the only documents where anybody seems to truly care about that kind of thing (e.g. legal documents) are always sent to me through DocuSign anyway, so maybe it's become a non-issue. </p>\n<p>PDF Studio and Nitro PDF have a lot of other Acrobat-like features, like the ability to create forms and add headers and footers and so on. I'm sure other people have needs for those things, but I don't, so those don't do anything for me. </p>\n<p>Anyway. As you can see, I'm leaning towards PDF Expert, even if I wish it did a few more things. The speed and ease of use of it just outweighs the extra features of PDF Studio, and its OCR and document editing just blow everything else out of the water. What's the point of batch OCR if the OCR is going to be crap? Better to figure out an Automator solution with PDF Expert than waste time and money on slow, crap OCR. Nitro PDF seems better than PDF Studio in most respects, but it still fails in the main one that matters to me \u2014 fast, good OCR \u2014 and so that probably will be the determinant. </p>\n<p>In terms of cost, PDF Expert is $80/year (50% off for students and educators) or $140 one-time. PDF Studio Standard is $99, Pro is $140 (and the Batch OCR is a Pro feature); there is a 50% discount for students and educators. So basically similar pricing for both. I am a little allergic to software subscriptions, but $40/year is not that bad, especially since I would have to use it for over 3 years for the one-time price to be justified, and who knows what the best software choice will be in 3 years? </p>\n<p>Nitro is $180 if I want \"extra features\" like OCR, and requires an additional $10/mo. subscription to sign documents. There is no educator discount that I can see, so that makes it way more expensive in my case. </p>\n<p>EDIT: PDF Reader Pro is $80 (one-time) if you want to be able to OCR things, 50% educator discount. </p>\n<p>I'm curious if other people have thoughts about this, or if there is something out there that blows these out of the water that I'm missing. My big take-away is that there are totally viable alternatives to Acrobat, which is positive no matter what.</p></div>",

I\u2019m excited to share with you an iOS app that I\u2019ve developed called CNDWN. It\u2019s fully developed in SwiftUI. It\u2019s also the first countdown app that offers all features for free and is available on Apple TV, iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and Mac!</p>\n<p>CNDWN is designed to help you keep track of important events and deadlines in your life. With this app, you can create and manage countdowns, countups, and progress bars with ease. The best part? It supports iCloud synchronization, so you can access your countdowns across all your Devices.</p>\n<p>One of the standout features of CNDWN is its support for Widgets and Live Activities. You can add widgets to your lock screen, home screen or standby screen (new in iOS 17), giving you quick access to your countdowns without having to open the app. The app also offers live activities, allowing you to track the progress of ongoing events in real-time.</p>\n<p>Never miss an important event again! CNDWN sends notifications for upcoming countdowns, and you can customize them to suit your needs.</p>\n<p>Last but not least, CNDWN supports dark mode, making it easy to use the app in low-light conditions without straining your eyes.</p>\n<p>I am also looking forward to implement the new Suggestions API for the new Apple Journal when it is released in iOS 17.1 or 17.2.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/id6455257754\">Download</a> CNDWN now and start counting down to your next big event!</p>\n<p>Looking forward to hearing your thoughts and feedback. Enjoy counting down with CNDWN.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/id6455257754\">https://apps.apple.com/app/id6455257754</a></p></div>",

I often fly on long flights and sometimes have to go to areas with limited access to power outlets, and it's become a bit of a struggle. My MacBook is getting on the older side, and I've noticed that the battery capacity isn't what it used to be. So, that's partly to blame for my battery headaches. </p>\n<p>I use my MacBook for work, and that often means running multiple browser tabs simultaneously. This drains the battery, and most tabs I can't afford to close. I've read online that some applications continue to run in the background, so I've become vigilant about shutting them down when I'm not using them. I've also learned to turn off Bluetooth when I'm not using it, and keeping my brightness low, which has helped a bit. </p>\n<p>But again, it often dies down on me and I\u2019m left helpless. It isn\u2019t too old to replace yet, so anything else I can do to maximize battery?  </p>\n<p>Your advice would be greatly appreciated!</p></div>",

Especially because you can have multiple such brains - one for each topic. My lawyer friend creates one brain for each of his cases, and uploads every document related to the case into it.</p>\n<p>If you want to try it out, you can test it for free for 30 days from this link - <a href=\"https://elephas.app/?ref=rMacApps-SuperBrain-2709\">Elephas</a></p>\n<p>This feature uses a combination of Mac storage with OpenAI\u2019s feature. Highly optimised for cost savings.</p>\n<p>And it's privacy friendly, and all the data remains on your computer (It does use OpenAI to generate embeddings.

About a year ago, I started went full time on my freelance writing business and ended up hiring more team members to the point where I wanted to switch from Evernote to something that had more functionality. I was originally using the personal Evernote plan before switching briefly to Evernote Teams (which is now over $25/user/month).</p>\n<p>Long story short, I ended up testing most/all of the major Evernote alternatives, and wanted to compile each of their pros and cons here in the hopes that it will save someone else some time and money. Below, you can find the pros and cons for all of the Evernote alternatives and similar apps I tried: Taskade, Notion, Obsidian, OneNote, Clickup and Google Keep.</p>\n<p>These are all quality apps, and what is \u201cbest\u201d depends partly on your needs and budget. Let me know if you're using any Evernote alternative(s) that I missed and I'll add them to the list!</p>\n<h2>Taskade: Evernote alternative with better collaboration + task/project management features</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.taskade.com/\">https://www.taskade.com/</a></p>\n<p>The first Evernote alternative I tried was actually Notion, but Notion's own price increases led me to discover the app that ultimately became my favorite: Taskade. Taskade is often billed as a Notion alternative, and has pretty much all of the features Notion does. I use the Pro plan, which is $19 per month for up to 10 team members. If you\u2019re not working with a team, I\u2019d highly recommend their free plan, but the biggest draw for me was Taskade\u2019s collaborative tools.</p>\n<p>Pros:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Taskade has much stronger collaboration features than Evernote. Beyond collaborative editing, Taskade has in-app chatting, video calls etc. which are all ideal for working with a team.</li>\n<li>Taskade has a really good web clipper! This is a big deal, as that is basically Evernote\u2019s best feature. Not all productivity and organization apps have a solid web clipper, so this is a key feature for an app to qualify as a great Evernote alternative, not just a supplement to Evernote.</li>\n<li>I also found it much better for task tracking and management than Evernote, especially with the large numbers of free templates they provide.</li>\n<li>There are AI features integrated into Taskade that make real-time suggestions as you work. It sounds gimmicky but they have a ton of templates that make it genuinely useful to use for stuff like generating ideas, cleaning up your writing, etc. all in the same interface.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If databases are your thing, then Notion is still a better option than Taskade.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Taskade managed to fill the gaps in functionality of Evernote with greater ease-of-use and flexibility than Notion, and the cost savings are huge. That is what makes it my all-around top pick.</p>\n<h2>Notion: Evernote alternative and a lot more</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.notion.so/\">https://www.notion.so/</a></p>\n<p>Speaking of Taskade, it's hard not to mention Notion, which is probably the best-known app in this sphere. I tested out the \u201cPlus\u201d plan, which costs $8 per user per month. Note how much less expensive that is than Evernote Teams.</p>\n<p>Not only does Notion cost less than most Evernote plans, but it was also more tailored to my needs. The original Evernote was built around individual note-taking and organizing. While Teams was developed for collaboration, that is what Notion was built to facilitate in the first place. Its collaboration features are richer and more powerful than what Evernote offers.</p>\n<p>Pros:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Not to continually dump on Notion, but Notion is still more affordable than Evernote even at its higher end plans, and comes with a lot more functionality for the money.</li>\n<li>Notion\u2019s template collection is awesome, and the code block integration is nice.</li>\n<li>Given the concern around questionable support from Evernote going forward, Notion is a nice alternative in having a massive community and company behind it that regularly rolls out new features and fixes. They're still lacking some things like a nice offline mode, but it's generally improving.</li>\n<li>There are a lot of customization options available.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Notion loads slowly on some of my devices, and occasionally feels unwieldy and unnecessarily complicated. If you're looking for an Evernote alternative that focuses mostly on notetaking/web clipping etc., it can be overly complicated/pricey.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Obsidian: excellent offline-only Evernote alternative for simple notetaking</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://obsidian.md/\">https://obsidian.md/</a></p>\n<p>Pros:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Obsidian is similar to Notion and Taskade in that it uses Markdown and has a lot of added functionality that Evernote doesn\u2019t.</li>\n<li>The core of Obsidian is completely free. It\u2019s still worth checking if you need any of their add-on features, as they do charge for these.</li>\n<li>Works well offline and uses the same markdown format that\u2019s easy to learn even if you\u2019re not already familiar</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lack of good collaboration features made it impossible for my use case.</li>\n<li>Rough mobile experience: this was one of my issues with Evernote, and Obsidian unfortunately has the same issue, where it\u2019s simply not that built-out on mobile.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Overall, Obsidian\u2019s attraction and major issues both come from being a fairly simple app. Similarly, the lack of online features can be a con (if you work with others or like sharing/collaborating on documents) but also a pro (if you\u2019re looking for something that won\u2019t distract you and/or to work offline).</p>\n<h2>OneNote: intuitive notetaking app that integrates into MS Office</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/onenote/digital-note-taking-app\">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/onenote/digital-note-taking-app</a></p>\n<p>OneNote was actually the first alternative to Evernote that I tried; I have a 365 subscription, so I figured I may as well. As you would guess from the name of this app, it is a direct competitor to Evernote.</p>\n<p>There is shared note-taking available through OneNote, but that is about the extent of it. Its functionality is pretty limited when it comes to managing and collaborating with teams on tasks.</p>\n<p>Pros:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Overall, I found it easier to stay organized using OneNote than Evernote.</li>\n<li>Like Evernote, OneNote is great for what it does. It offers fantastic content sorting, tagging and annotation.</li>\n<li>While I\u2019m not a huge Microsoft user, I suspect it\u2019s nice to have everything on one subscription if you are.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>OneNote is not so great at web clipping. Evernote is way better in this area.</li>\n<li>For collaborative teams, OneNote is too basic to really get much done.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>OneNote is one of the closest to Evernote in terms of what it\u2019s best at, but I didn\u2019t find it much better overall at anything that would make me stick with it.</p>\n<h2>Clickup: well-rounded task focused alternative</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://clickup.com/\">https://clickup.com/</a></p>\n<p>While Clickup is an alternative to Evernote, like Notion and Taskade, it is more of an all-in-one productivity and organization suite.</p>\n<p>Pros:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Clickup is a solid task management app that offers whiteboards, docs, dashboards, chat and more to facilitate easy collaboration.</li>\n<li>I didn\u2019t use Clickup long enough to verify this myself, but I\u2019ve heard time and again that the support team is great, and the development team works hard to maintain and update the app.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>While Clickup does a lot of things Evernote does not, Evernote still is better for organizing materials for easy reference.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>(Google) Keep: simple, free notetaking alternative integrated into Google's apps</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.google.com/keep/\">https://www.google.com/keep/</a></p>\n<p>One more app I tried out was Google Keep. I\u2019ve used it on and off since 2015 because it integrated nicely into Google Calendar, and always found it to fall a bit short in terms of functionality. But it is free if you have a Google account, and I was curious how it compared to Evernote.</p>\n<p>Pros:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Google Keep supports web clipping, though with fewer bells and whistles than Evernote.</li>\n<li>You can share with other users with Google Keep; it also includes other basic features for checklists, reminders and so on.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The simplicity of Google Keep may appeal to users who only need the basics, but the functionality is quite limited compared to Evernote.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That wraps it up! Some of the Evernote alternatives I tested out were more direct notetaking only competitors, like Google Keep and OneNote. Unfortunately most of the note-taking only apps lack various features that Evernote has without adding enough other features to make up for it. Others, like Taskade, Notion and ClickUp, were designed to accommodate note-taking within a broader task-management and collaboration suite.</p>\n<h1>Tl;dr:</h1>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Taskade:</strong> Notetaking + task management focused app with a nice free plan. Overall my favorite as it's the most intuitive for task/project management and has the best collaboration features for working with a team at a lower price than both Evernote and Notion.</li>\n<li><strong>Notion:</strong> Notion is arguably the biggest Evernote alternative. Solid notetaking functionality and other features Evernote lacks. Still cheaper than Evernote even after raising their prices!</li>\n<li><strong>Obsidian:</strong> Nice alternative built around markdown that's my favorite for offline only use, as it lacks the distractions of the web based ones. Unfortunately that also means it lacks some of the functionality I need for everyday use.</li>\n<li><strong>OneNote:</strong> Microsoft's notetaking app that comes free with Office 365 and other plans. I didn't spend too long on OneNote as I don't use many MS apps and couldn't justify paying for it after we left Office 365, but it seems to be well integrated into their other apps.</li>\n<li><strong>Google Keep:</strong> Free, simple notetaking app. Lacks some of Evernote's features but can be a good free Evernote alternative if you don't need advanced functionality and already use Google's other apps.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Each of these alternatives has somewhat different target markets and I'd recommend trying out a few as they all have free plans. I mainly use Taskade day-to-day as it has all the features I used Evernote for like web-clipping and easy notetaking, but adds better teamwork and task management functionality that I needed for my business. With that said, I also use Obsidian as an offline-only one for when I don't want to get distracted.</p>\n<p>Let me know in the comments if I missed any that you guys have tried and try to include pros/cons if you can.</p></div>",

            "content_html": "<caption>Open: <a href='https://reddit.com/r/macapps/comments/16fy20u/private_llm_a_gpt_chatbot_that_runs_fully_offline/'>Reddit</a></caption><div><br></div><div><p>Hello fellow Mac users,</p>\n<p>My app is an AI chatbot works fully offline, without any subscriptions or privacy sacrifices. I\u2019d <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/14n09ph/personal_gpt_a_tiny_ai_chatbot_that_runs_fully/\">posted</a> <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/14ijgtj/giveaway_personal_gpt_an_ai_chatbot_that_runs/\">about</a> this app on r/ChatGPT and r/Apple a few months ago, and got a great reception from both those subreddits.</p>\n<p>The app has come a long way since then. It started off as a universal iOS and macOS app with a fine tuned <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/togethercomputer/RedPajama-INCITE-Chat-3B-v1\">3B parameter LLM</a> on both macOS and iOS. Two months in, Apple asked me to rename the app (It was originally called Personal GPT) because OpenAI had a trademark on the term \u201cGPT\u201d in Switzerland. Eventually, I added a 7B parameter <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/Tap-M/Luna-AI-Llama2-Uncensored\">Llama 2 Uncensored</a> model as an optional download on iPhone 14 series phones and M1/M2 iPads. The current Mac app also ships with the 7B parameter Llama 2 Uncensored model by default.</p>\n<p>I wanted to wait until I had improved the macOS app to a point where it was super good, before posting it here on r/macapps. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/private_llm/status/1701140429033324805\">v1.3</a> of the macOS app was approved by Apple\u2019s Mac App Store review this morning, and latest version brings the amazing <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/WizardLM/WizardLM-13B-V1.2\">WizardLM 13B v1.2</a> model as an optional 6.9GB download for users with Apple Silicon Macs and at least 16GB of RAM. This is a <a href=\"https://chat.lmsys.org/?leaderboard\">SOTA</a> model that in some cases can outperform some internet hosted models. Don\u2019t take my word for it, try it out with these <a href=\"https://benchmarks.llmonitor.com\">prompts</a> or your own. We\u2019ve got a public <a href=\"https://testflight.apple.com/join/GmnO1fdb\">TestFlight beta</a> if you\u2019d like to try the app before buying it. It\u2019s a universal app, with means that if you purchase it on either the iOS App Store or the Mac App Store and you\u2019ll also get it on the other. Also, the app supports <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/family-sharing/\">Family Sharing</a>.</p>\n<p>I'm working on adding support for downloading even bigger (34B param) models for Apple Silicon Mac users with 32GB or more RAM, soon.</p>\n<p>Please feel free to AMA here, or on the app\u2019s <a href=\"https://discord.gg/g2vMMbtHRt\">discord</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/private-llm/id6448106860\">App Store</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://privatellm.app/\">Website</a></p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p></div>",

My goal with Godspeed was to make every single action doable with just your keyboard, and to have those actions respond instantly. Like Superhuman for your todo list.</p>\n<p>I built Godspeed for myself and have been using it daily for about six months now. Before that I used a couple other apps, like OmniFocus, but have found that they all have weak keyboard support and feel pretty slow.</p>\n<p>So Godspeed is my answer to those weak points.</p>\n<p>Something I want to note especially for the r/macapps crowd: Godspeed is an Electron app. But it may be the fastest and most memory-efficient Electron app you've ever used. It generally uses less memory than most of the native apps I run, and it's definitely a hell of a lot faster than them.</p>\n<p>A few of my friends have started using it in the past couple months and their feedback has been incredibly valuable. So I've decided to open up access to more folks for a public beta. Access is free during the beta, but if all goes well I do eventually intend to offer subscription and one-time purchase options. And I'll have discounts available for beta users!</p>\n<p>Thanks for checking it out, I'd appreciate any feedback you have!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://godspeedapp.com\">https://godspeedapp.com</a></p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/88n2lyyvrk7b1.gif\">a short gif showing Godspeed in action</a></p></div>",

            "content_html": "<caption>Open: <a href='https://reddit.com/r/macapps/comments/145ymem/we_will_also_be_joining_the_reddit_blackout_from/'>Reddit</a></caption><div><br></div><div><p>Hi\u00a0r/MacApps</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Recently Reddit Inc has announced changes to their API which, if enacted, will shut down many, if not all, 3rd party apps that a large number of Redditors use to access and enjoy their favourite communities.</p>\n<p>One of the most critical changes to the API is that it is moving from a free to a paid model, resulting in expenses that developers of 3rd party apps simply cannot afford. To put the price change in to context, Apollo, one of the most popular 3rd party apps for Reddit, is looking at a cost of $1.7 million per month to continue operating. That's a cost of $12,000 per 50 million API requests. In contrast, Apollo pays Imgur $166 for every 50 million API calls.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>This means popular apps like\u00a0Apollo,\u00a0Reddit Is Fun,\u00a0Narwhal\u00a0and many more will have to shut down, permanently.</p>\n<p>Even if you're not using a 3rd party app yourself, these changes are likely to impact the communities you enjoy as well, with the vast majority of moderation teams relying on 3rd party or self-made tools, that utilize Reddit's API.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>What happens; On June 12th,\u00a0we and a growing number of other subs\u00a0- large and small - will go dark for 48 hours. During that time, you will not be able to view or post any content on\u00a0r/MacApps. This action isn't something we take lightly.</p>\n<p>We understand that many of you enjoy coming here on a daily basis to keep up with the apps, but we believe that we must take a stand on this topic - and this is how we can do so.</p>\n<p>We understand that Reddit is a company that has to make money in order to offer us a place to be the community that we are - but killing beloved 3rd party apps is not they way to do it. We are not asking Reddit to provide a paid service for free - we are asking for reasonable pricing for apps that people have come to love and depend on to participate in their communities.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>What you can do to support this:</p>\n<p>While subs going dark is one thing, regular users can help as well.</p>\n<p>Reach out to Reddit via the channels available to you: Modmail\u00a0r/reddit, comment in relevant posts regarding the API changes, submit your comments via the contact forms.</p>\n<p>Spread the word about the changes and the consequences where you can. Doesn't have to be on Reddit. The important thing is getting it attention.</p>\n<p>Participate in the communities that highlight this issue:\u00a0r/Save3rdPartyApps,\u00a0r/apolloapp,\u00a0r/redditisfun,\u00a0r/getnarwhal</p>\n<p>And finally stay off Reddit completely from June 12th to 14th. The blackout is one thing, but users staying away from the site entirely will send an equally important message.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Thank you,</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p></div>",

I've been an Alfred user for years. However, for the sake of fairness, curiosity, and always searching for something better and more efficient, I decided to install Raycast and compare since anyone who has been on r/macapps for a while may know that that's <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/macapps/comments/13c1c7m/master_list_of_definitive_app_comparisons_view/\">a hobby</a>. </p>\n<p>Here are some considerations to keep in mind: </p>\n<p><strong>Your Privacy in Their</strong> <strong>Privacy Policies.</strong><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.alfredapp.com/terms/\"><strong>Alfred</strong></a> - Privacy-conscious. <em>Alfred is the product.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Alfred only contacts our server when activating your Powerpack license  in order to validate it, as well as periodically checking for new  software updates.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.raycast.com/privacy\"><strong>Raycast</strong></a> - <em>You are the product.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We use Personal Data for the following purposes...<br />\nTo analyze how you interact with our Service...<br />\nTo maintain and improve the content and functionality of the Service...<br />\nTo develop new products and services...<br />\nTo tell you about products or services we believe may be of interest to you... <br />\nReason: For our legitimate interests or those of a third party, i.e. to promote our business to you...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Efficiency Considerations.</strong><br />\nAccording to my usage history, I trigger Alfred about 42 times daily, or 15,330 times yearly.</p>\n<p>In Raycast, every search is stalled behind a menu that needs to be triggered unless you configure an additional shortcut for each feature. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Want to search for a file? Gotta select the option first and hit enter to begin searching.</li>\n<li>Want to perform an action on the file? Yet another shortcut (CMD+K).</li>\n<li>Want to trigger any other feature? You guessed it, another shortcut or menu to trigger first.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That's an additional 2\u20135 seconds <em>every single search</em> or 8.5\u201321 <em>HOURS</em> a year for something Alfred can do immediately on the first trigger. Am I missing something here? </p>\n<p><strong>Appearance.</strong> <br />\nThe Raycast preferences and user interface is the clear winner in terms of eyecandy, no arguments to be had. Alfred could learn from this, though Alfred has more granular customizable preferences. </p>\n<p><strong>Complexity.</strong><br />\nBecause Raycast has a cleaner design, it can be easier to find what you're looking for if you're not a power user. </p>\n<p><strong>Feature offerings.</strong><br />\nThis is basically a tie for the most common features\u2014E.g., web/file searches, clipboard history, calculator, notes, links, etc.<br />\nThe recent AI integration with Raycast is the major distinction ($10/month or $96/yr <a href=\"https://www.raycast.com/pricing\">subscription</a>). <br />\nOne can also use the API from OpenAI with an Alfred workflow with Powerpack ($42 <a href=\"https://www.alfredapp.com/shop/\">license</a>). </p>\n<p>Ultimately, we all have to consider and decide what we care about most. <br />\nWhat unique features, considerations, or tips have I missed that stand out for why you prefer one over the other?</p></div>",
