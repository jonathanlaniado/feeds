            "content_html": "<p>Seven years is a pretty long time in tracker years. Digitalcore (DC) started out as a straight-up 0day scene tracker, and over time we\u2019ve grown into something bigger. The heart is still scene releases, but we\u2019ve opened the doors wider: foreign content and solid P2P uploads by our users with a few bots like <strong>audionuts</strong> (and our own in-house bot) keep the place alive and moving.</p>\n<p>PS. We also replaced the old PHP tracker, it served its time, and it was struggling to do it right. We decided to build something better, and the result is our custom-coded <strong>GO tracker</strong>. The difference is night and day: faster, smoother, and it actually feels like it can breathe with the kind of load we\u2019re pushing these days.</p>\n<p>We offer fast 0day scene releases (foreign content as well)  untouched!  We have Leech bonus, Seed bonus, IRC Bonus, \u00a0API access, RSS, Requests, Bonus Points and IRC announce.  DC works with Autobrr, Prowlarr, Jackett, Crosseed and others. You get 7 days free leech on signup and 25Gb upload credit so make use of that!

I previously have been using torrent aggregators.</p>\n<p>I have been seeding public trackers with my combined router and storage server, for I'm guessing for the past six months. During that time I have built up a massive ratio. I was using nordvpn since my parents bought it, but as of yesterday I bought a VPN that supports port forwarding.</p>\n<p>The ratio is about all I have to go off, and I think it would be easy to spoof, but its almost all I have to go off.

Since the tracker is still in its early stages, the content library is limited for now, but steadily growing.
