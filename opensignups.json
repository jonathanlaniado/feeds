We supply some of the largest private trackers with lots of their top content. If you are a member there and download top TV shows and games, there is a good chance you already have torrents seeding in your client that were 'created by seedpool'.</p>\n<p>A few months ago we decided to start our own tracker. And we want to try something different.</p>\n<p>Incentives and on-site promotions are based on the size of your <strong>seedpool</strong>, rather than the amount of data you've uploaded.</p>\n<p>With a large enough seedpool, you're not required to upload anything at all. (you still have to maintain an overall non-shit ratio)</p>\n<p>You will find most 0-day content uploaded here as soon as it drops. Scene TV/Movie releases are all unrar'ed and seeded minutes after they pre.</p>\n<p>TV shows in particular have excellent pre times which often trump the larger trackers.</p>\n<p>All individual TV episodes are <strong>freeleech</strong>.</p>\n<p>All Anime is <strong>freeleech</strong></p>\n<p>All music packs are <strong>freeleech</strong></p>\n<p>Anything remux is <strong>freeleech</strong>.</p>\n<p>10 day minimum seed time on all releases, else Hit n' Run******</p>\n<p><strong>**Users with a seedpool &gt;</strong> <strong>250GB are immune to HnRs.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>**Users with a seedpool &gt; 1000GB (500GB for founding members) are immune to HnRs and enjoy site-wide freeleech.</strong></p>\n<p>All releases are kept in their original format to preserve cross-seed functionality so we have plenty of users with &gt; 500GiB seedpools who haven't downloaded a single thing from us (yet)</p>\n<p>Stats:</p>\n<p>Torrents: 86,500 (this is most of the 0-day content released in the past 4 months)</p>\n<p>TV Shows: 46,000</p>\n<p>Anime: 4,900</p>\n<p>HD Movies:  3,300</p>\n<p>4K Movies: 1,500</p>\n<p>Sports: 2,500</p>\n<p>PC Games: 3,800 (only unmodified rar'ed scene releases are allowed)</p>\n<p>Switch Games: 2,100</p>\n<p>Music/E-books: many thousands, all served in daily 0-day packs.</p>\n<p>Music packs include an .nfo with the individual albums listed so the contents are searchable.</p>\n<p>Anything older than \\~2 weeks (aside from our internals) is not seeded anymore (by us), though you may ask for a reseed.</p>\n<p>Bear in mind that we focus on newly released scene/p2p uploads, and several terabytes worth of releases are posted daily, so we are constantly making space for new stuff.  </p>\n<p>Seedpool iNTERNAL release group specializing in 4K remuxes. Lately we were the first group (as far as we know) to drop a <em>popular movie</em> UHD bluray remux. (name starts with a bee)</p>\n<p>Modern customizable Material Design layout. All of the usual bells n' whistles  - RSS, Requests, Points economy, IRC announce bot.</p>\n<p>Each user gets their own on-site The Lounge instance with a <a href=\"mailto:username@127.0.0.1\"><em>username</em>@127.0.0.1</a> hostname and operator privileges. So there's no need to connect to IRC to see the chat or announces. (but you can do that too)</p>\n<p>Customized music announces that add several fields like Genre, Format and Quality which are not part of the release name.</p>\n<p><em>Example:</em></p>\n<p><code>\u3010 Rap Music \u10fb K3ndr1ck_L4m4r-GNX-PR0P3R-24BIT-W3B-FL4C-2024-BiKO \u10fb uploader@https://seedpool.org/torrents/xxxxxx \u10fb \u3014 FLAC @ 48.0 kHz \u3015 \u10fb 512.58\u00a0MiB</code></p>\n<p>Prowlarr support, yep.  Autobrr hasn't updated our IRC announce definitions since the seedpool 2.0 release but you can expect an update over the weekend</p>\n<p>There are 0 ads on seedpool and we do not accept donations.</p>\n<p>We only have one rule.</p>",
