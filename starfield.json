But I don\u2019t think that is a complete answer. Yes, vendors need more credits. But at the same time I feel that will only serve to accelerate players becoming tech mogul rich. (And let\u2019s be honest it\u2019s not hard to become stupid rich in this game) And once you have dumb money the game loses some of its grab. The struggle is some of the best part of a game. So here are my ideas for fixing the economy:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>More vendor credits. Obviously this should happen anyway. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Items need to be worth less. Who came up with these values? Why does a drink cost 400 credits or a shotgun costs 25k credits when a whole ship is like 160k? Like what? That\u2019s like saying you can have 6 shotguns or a whole car. A whole house in Akila was like 95k? That\u2019s not even 4 shotguns. What?? </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ships need to cost more. Straight up. They made it out in the Starfield Direct video that ships are end game Lego\u2019s. They don\u2019t cost nearly enough. Modifying them doesn\u2019t cost nearly enough. If they want ships to be end game, end game players are not broke. They should keep the tier system though. A parts/ships should cost less than B, which cost less than C. Focus the cost increases more heavily the higher the tier. That way early game mods to your A ship are an investment but not impossible. But late game C class ships should cost a fair amount to buy or mod. I have 2m on my character at 63 and nothing to spend it on. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A vendor in the major starports that has major credits, but only buys resources. What is the incentive to be a trucker? Or outposts for that matter? You don\u2019t need the resources to craft. Easy enough to find resources already without the outpost investment. Mass producing fancy do-dads by the 10k kg but then selling them is a bear. Give me a dedicated spaceport cargo vendor, and a reason to build a factory out of outposts.</p>\n</li>\n</ol></div>",

It can also be a good way to not only gain experience but credits too!  Here are some tricks and tips that I learned during my time surveying the world of Montara Luna in the Cheyenne system during my last session in Starfield.</a></p>\n<p>Surveying planets in Starfield can be a lot of fun.  Exploring the surface of a world somewhere in the middle of nowhere can be a tall order!  I have some tips that will help make this more efficient for you without some of the frustrations I encountered!</p>\n<p>That\u2019s right, surveying planets can be very lucrative!  If you enjoy exploring planets and getting into scraps with the local wildlife, while delving into caves or abandoned facilities surveying can pay you a fair amount of credits for the effort.</p>\n<p>The sticking point for a lot of people is not understanding how the \u201csurveying\u201d mechanic functions in the game.  So let\u2019s explain how we can make this process more efficient and rewarding for your budding explorer in Starfield.</p>\n<p>When pulling up your scanner, you will notice a list of survey targets on the left side of the screen.  It is here you will see the number of different species you need to seek out, scan, and complete data for as well as the quantity of unique resources that can be found.  This involves, in many cases, scanning multiple species multiple times until your data is 100% complete.  The only exception to this are resources.  Scanning a resource once will provide a complete piece of data for the overall survey of the planet.</p>\n<p>The second part of that data is the Planet Features, or grayed-out circles with question marks in the center.  These are unique features that can be found on the planet.  They can vary from unique points of interest or interesting geological features.  Complete these by using your scanner and looking for what I call \u201cpoint of interest\u201d markers and \u201cseismic activity\u201d markers and visiting those locations.  At times you may need to scan multiples of these features to complete the data or feature.  Once completed the picture will show at the bottom of the Survey Data panel while you have your scanner up.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/t5ijh1yzzfqb1.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e6885803c79814601a8b5d39dd2e463f0d4fb80\">Survey completion at 63&#37; completion, 5 of the total 7 \\\"aliens\\\" have been scanned, 1 of the total 7 \\\"plants\\\" have been scanned, 3 of the total 8 resources have been scanned, and we have two Planet Features to discover (blank circles with '?' inside).</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/8wkf72p31gqb1.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1dbc597728772477e3d35dd1e25b3adb1bbfe048\">These two scanning icons tend to lead to planetary features most often!</a></p>\n<p>Sometimes some of the flora or fauna can be a bit elusive.  In order to tackle this take time to first check if you have a Biome Complete notification on your Survey Data.  If you are seeing this, you will need to hop into your ship, in most cases, and visit a new biome!</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/hiv9atrc1gqb1.png?width=418&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=658202ac9749420f1bc6745a680a4faf8b7db6e3\">Once you see a \\\"BIOME COMPLETE\\\" notification on your scanner survey panel, you will need to travel to a new biome to complete the data for this planet.  This can sometimes lead to exploring several biomes to find your elusive targets!</a></p>\n<p>Even then, you may still have a hard time finding your targets.  Consider taking the time to survey the environment from an elevated location like a hill or structure.  At times, some flora or fauna can be more prevalent in \u201csub-biomes\u201d within the area.</p>\n<p>The final tip is to be sure you keep your scanner up at all times.  This will help you see subjects that have not been scanned (blue outline), scanned objects (colored blue), or complete surveyed subjects (green).  Now this one had me stuck on a planet for over an hour.  At times some creatures may only be found in caves, so don\u2019t skip over these points of interest while surveying a planet.  The final place some of these creatures can be found is actually in the water!  It may be the last spot you would suspect with a lack of interaction in the game with water, but there are actually aquatic species that need to be scanned at times.  The best way to find them is to keep your scanner up, otherwise, they may be obscured below the surface.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/4kdzvwsu2gqb1.png?width=553&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a2efde72bbc7478f6c5757c2d6040da08b7623a\">Keeping your scanner up can help you find elusive Fauna hidden below the surface of the water.  You can see one of these creatures has been scanned (fully blue) while the other is available to collect survey data from (outlined in blue).</a></p>\n<p>Once you have completed the data for the planet, you will get a nice little banner added to your scanner survey data panel that lets you know the planet has been Fully Surveyed to 100%.</p>\n<p>Your work doesn\u2019t stop there!  While in orbit, be sure to check for gas giants in the system.  These are planets that do not have a terrestrial surface to land on.  These planets can be scanned from orbit for some quick data.</p>\n<p>Once you have your haul of data, you can find the survey data within your character\u2019s inventory under the \u201cNOTES\u201d area.  You will see that scan data is actually worth a pretty fair amount!  If you are doing this on the side, or it is your primary focus in the game, you can make good money with very little investment.</p>\n<p>To make the most of your time, take your survey data back to The Eye in orbit around Jemison, where the <strong>city</strong> New Atlantis is located.  If you have not met Vladimir you will need to complete some faction/primary story quests for the Constellation group to unlock this area.  Once you board The Eye you can speak with Vladimir about survey data.  This opens the option of selling your hard-earned data for top dollar.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/xs6jcwme3gqb1.png?width=637&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e4ed20fa826e9954f8561b78c07fb50db091b6c2\">Vladimir Sall is your best friend when it comes to making good credits from your hard-earned survey work in Starfield.  He can be found aboard The Eye in orbit around the planet Jemison, where you can visit New Atlantis.</a></p>\n<p>Be careful though!  If you run Vladimir out of credits you will not make the full amount from the value your data has.  Either visit again in 48 in-game hours or wait for the same duration for Vladimir to restock his credits.  In a lot of ways, since the data weighs nothing at all, it can be viewed as a \u201csavings account\u201d when credits get slim or you need a quick injection of credits to make that next important purchase.</p>\n<p>So there you have it!  Get out there!  Go boldly where no space explorer has gone before and rake in those credits in the process!</p>\n<p>If you found any of this helpful let me know!  If there is anything that you would like to add to this, please throw your .02 in below!</p>\n<p>Edit:  Corrected subject.</p></div>",

It's plausible that if I stole your apple, and you found me 10 days later, even if I had 100 apples, you could identify your stolen apple. Maybe. But I probably couldn't, and I probably wouldn't keep a stolen one separate from a bunch of otherwise identical items. And the odds drop for mass-produced items. Would you actually report your stolen apple to the authorities anyway? </p>\n<p>I think some items should have the \"stolen\" attribute expire after a certain time, especially if nobody even saw you steal the item. At least work it into the skill tree maybe. I'm in a different galaxy every day, these things are everywhere. But I don't see any reason you shouldn't be able to consume a stolen item on purpose.</p></div>",

There's no HUD notification, you just need to presume there's something you could check out. NA has so many that never provide a HUD notice like the one with a little old lady in a park talking to herself. Back on point, as you walk towards the checkpoint there's a guy being hassled. I remember missing out on that in my first character because I was too much in a hurry, and hadn't quite then realized how some quests occur.</p>\n<p>Later in same character NG+ I did stop to listen and see if there was something I could do. There was. Simple go there, talk to someone, come back quest. Done and done. No other options. A few creds, nice.</p>\n<p>In another new character I stopped too, had very few options, but now in NG+ I suddenly see a \"metric butt ton\" of options to choose from with the various characters involved because I have those perks or did some quests. I decided to see where all those options can go, made a save, started choosing one, reloading, chose another, etc until I saw all the responses. </p>\n<p>There were so many options for just one section of the dialogue it rolled down past the screen needing scrolled. That guy being harassed at the Spaceport does have a very \"Good\" end that completes right there with apologies all around and acknowledgement that one side was wrong and the other freely believing and accepting the apologies. </p>\n<p>It isn't the \"more\" correct one or the only correct one, just the one that seemed more along the Starborn path you can choose outside of the narrowness of the Hunter or the Emissary. </p>\n<p>And all I had to do was listen and continue playing.</p></div>",

Leaving Starfield to basically remain as-is until the Starfield 2 dev cycle rolls around in 2035 or whenever.</p>\n<p>What I\u2019m hoping to see is essentially the Stellaris model applied to Starfield. A long, long support cycle that not only expands but refines the game to where a player 2 or 3 years from now will enjoy improved mechanics and greatly expanded content. An overall &amp; ongoing evolution, <strong>not</strong> just the base game + the opportunity to visit tacked-on DLC Planets #1 to #4.</p>\n<p>When most developers decide to keep expanding on existing games past a few location DLCs, they stop work on the base game, roll out an MMORPG version and produce content for that instead. I haven\u2019t spent a dime on those titles and never will. It\u2019s just not for me. </p>\n<p>I don\u2019t want to be shunted to Starfield 76. I want the single player game I have today, but to see it grow and evolve over time. Hell, I\u2019ll pay for the privilege. Repeatedly.</p>\n<p>Stellaris, for all its faults, spoiled me in this regard. Anyone who played in 2016, 2019 and 2023 could tell you they had vastly different experiences each time. Some older features are missed, while there\u2019s some legacy mechanics that stick around that probably shouldn\u2019t. But it\u2019s hard to argue that it hasn\u2019t been worth the ride.</p>\n<p>It would be nice to see Starfield take a similar approach.</p></div>",

Some people are happy to have an escape, identify with their character and let their imagination do the work. Some folk find endless satisfaction speed-running SNES roms, and Starfield's loop lets them go hog wild.</p>\n<p>Other gamers see the code in the matrix, flawed game design choices and incomplete systems. They see potential that perhaps only emerged late in the dev cycle, and are frustrated the studio didn't release that version of the game.</p>\n<p>Everyone should understand Bethesda is not a person. Nothing bad will happen if you point out the flaws in their product. They will not be annihilated by a low Metacritic score, they are not abusers who go silent treatment because of critique. Sky Father will not smite them for the sin of an imperfect video game.</p>\n<p>Bethesda is a business. The market tells them if their work is good enough, and you are a member of the market. If you want BGS's next game to be better, if you want BGS to invest massively to upgrade Starfield to the version we all can see... we <em>have</em> to tell them. We have to demand it.</p>\n<p>BGS's brand is big enough they can coast on safe, tried-and-true systems while an army of digital artists craft pretty environments. If you want something better, tell them. They are listening. Bethesda leadership are writing specification documents for TESVI and Starfield 2.0 <em>right now</em>. Do not be afraid to say <em>X</em> system would be better if it did <em>Y</em>. This is called feedback, and software development runs on feedback like starships run on Helium-3.</p>\n<p>You have that power, and you should not be afraid to use it.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>(Some people on both sides care deeply about \"other people's opinions\" validating their own. Ignore it- this is a trap with no winners.)</p></div>",
