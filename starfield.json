For some reason even with a few guns only 1 spacesuit, pack and helmet + basic Aids i was carrying 140 kg which was odd. I couldnt figure out where the weight was coming from, that is when i decided to check my grenade section. Idk why but i had just assumed like ammo they had no weight. Turns out i was carrying around 70 kg of mines for hours...argh it would be nice if in the inventory next to the category of item you could see total weight of that category just to give u a good idea of things. Any one else have anything similar to this ?</p></div>",

Leaving Starfield to basically remain as-is until the Starfield 2 dev cycle rolls around in 2035 or whenever.</p>\n<p>What I\u2019m hoping to see is essentially the Stellaris model applied to Starfield. A long, long support cycle that not only expands but refines the game to where a player 2 or 3 years from now will enjoy improved mechanics and greatly expanded content. An overall &amp; ongoing evolution, <strong>not</strong> just the base game + the opportunity to visit tacked-on DLC Planets #1 to #4.</p>\n<p>When most developers decide to keep expanding on existing games past a few location DLCs, they stop work on the base game, roll out an MMORPG version and produce content for that instead. I haven\u2019t spent a dime on those titles and never will. It\u2019s just not for me. </p>\n<p>I don\u2019t want to be shunted to Starfield 76. I want the single player game I have today, but to see it grow and evolve over time. Hell, I\u2019ll pay for the privilege. Repeatedly.</p>\n<p>Stellaris, for all its faults, spoiled me in this regard. Anyone who played in 2016, 2019 and 2023 could tell you they had vastly different experiences each time. Some older features are missed, while there\u2019s some legacy mechanics that stick around that probably shouldn\u2019t. But it\u2019s hard to argue that it hasn\u2019t been worth the ride.</p>\n<p>It would be nice to see Starfield take a similar approach.</p></div>",
