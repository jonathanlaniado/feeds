Leaving Starfield to basically remain as-is until the Starfield 2 dev cycle rolls around in 2035 or whenever.</p>\n<p>What I\u2019m hoping to see is essentially the Stellaris model applied to Starfield. A long, long support cycle that not only expands but refines the game to where a player 2 or 3 years from now will enjoy improved mechanics and greatly expanded content. An overall &amp; ongoing evolution, <strong>not</strong> just the base game + the opportunity to visit tacked-on DLC Planets #1 to #4.</p>\n<p>When most developers decide to keep expanding on existing games past a few location DLCs, they stop work on the base game, roll out an MMORPG version and produce content for that instead. I haven\u2019t spent a dime on those titles and never will. It\u2019s just not for me. </p>\n<p>I don\u2019t want to be shunted to Starfield 76. I want the single player game I have today, but to see it grow and evolve over time. Hell, I\u2019ll pay for the privilege. Repeatedly.</p>\n<p>Stellaris, for all its faults, spoiled me in this regard. Anyone who played in 2016, 2019 and 2023 could tell you they had vastly different experiences each time. Some older features are missed, while there\u2019s some legacy mechanics that stick around that probably shouldn\u2019t. But it\u2019s hard to argue that it hasn\u2019t been worth the ride.</p>\n<p>It would be nice to see Starfield take a similar approach.</p></div>",

Some people are happy to have an escape, identify with their character and let their imagination do the work. Some folk find endless satisfaction speed-running SNES roms, and Starfield's loop lets them go hog wild.</p>\n<p>Other gamers see the code in the matrix, flawed game design choices and incomplete systems. They see potential that perhaps only emerged late in the dev cycle, and are frustrated the studio didn't release that version of the game.</p>\n<p>Everyone should understand Bethesda is not a person. Nothing bad will happen if you point out the flaws in their product. They will not be annihilated by a low Metacritic score, they are not abusers who go silent treatment because of critique. Sky Father will not smite them for the sin of an imperfect video game.</p>\n<p>Bethesda is a business. The market tells them if their work is good enough, and you are a member of the market. If you want BGS's next game to be better, if you want BGS to invest massively to upgrade Starfield to the version we all can see... we <em>have</em> to tell them. We have to demand it.</p>\n<p>BGS's brand is big enough they can coast on safe, tried-and-true systems while an army of digital artists craft pretty environments. If you want something better, tell them. They are listening. Bethesda leadership are writing specification documents for TESVI and Starfield 2.0 <em>right now</em>. Do not be afraid to say <em>X</em> system would be better if it did <em>Y</em>.
