Some people are happy to have an escape, identify with their character and let their imagination do the work. Some folk find endless satisfaction speed-running SNES roms, and Starfield's loop lets them go hog wild.</p>\n<p>Other gamers see the code in the matrix, flawed game design choices and incomplete systems. They see potential that perhaps only emerged late in the dev cycle, and are frustrated the studio didn't release that version of the game.</p>\n<p>Everyone should understand Bethesda is not a person. Nothing bad will happen if you point out the flaws in their product. They will not be annihilated by a low Metacritic score, they are not abusers who go silent treatment because of critique. Sky Father will not smite them for the sin of an imperfect video game.</p>\n<p>Bethesda is a business. The market tells them if their work is good enough, and you are a member of the market. If you want BGS's next game to be better, if you want BGS to invest massively to upgrade Starfield to the version we all can see... we <em>have</em> to tell them. We have to demand it.</p>\n<p>BGS's brand is big enough they can coast on safe, tried-and-true systems while an army of digital artists craft pretty environments. If you want something better, tell them. They are listening. Bethesda leadership are writing specification documents for TESVI and Starfield 2.0 <em>right now</em>. Do not be afraid to say <em>X</em> system would be better if it did <em>Y</em>. This is called feedback, and software development runs on feedback like starships run on Helium-3.</p>\n<p>You have that power, and you should not be afraid to use it.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>(Some people on both sides care deeply about \"other people's opinions\" validating their own. Ignore it- this is a trap with no winners.)</p></div>",
