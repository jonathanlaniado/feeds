Even as I played it, I could recognize the Bethesda game template underneath it all... but I accepted those old methodologies because I love the game for what it is.</p>\n<p>Going back to play Cyberpunk 2077 now makes me realize how antiquated some of the technology is with Starfield. Take dialogue scenes, for example;\nIn Starfield, you can see how the NPCs change from their current animation into this \"face-on, eyes-locked mode\", where you might as well be speaking to a mannequin.\nIn Cyberpunk, NPCs \"notice you\" approaching and seamlessly engage in dialogue, even as they continue performing other tasks like eating, smoking, etc.</p>\n<p>I'm still trying to put a finger on what makes Cyberpunk so much more immersive... I think it's a combination of several things put together. A huge part is that all the events in the game (whether it's gameplay or cutscenes) are shown strictly from the player's POV... and even in cutscenes you can often still look around.</p>\n<p>As much as I enjoyed my time in Starfield, I'm finding that Cyberpunk 2077 has a lot more to offer, even in the areas where the two games overlap. I know the theme and scope are not comparable, but theres a pretty big gap in depth and quality among the other things.</p>\n<p>What features from Cyberpunk would you wish to be integrated in Starfield?</p></div>",

In fact, I love it. I found an incredible spot with a gorgeous view. The building interface is intuitive. Snapping and clipping have good tolerances and the shadowing and lighting on placed objects looks natural. Decorating is a blast.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/c177ixra8vqb1.png?width=3840&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=258d25df1cc6abb809dffda235d8d3f65612f9ce\">The view from my mountainside lair</a></p>\n<p>But after unlocking all buildables and spending hours constructing what I <em>thought</em> was going to be a fantastic base of operations, I'm left wondering . . . <em>Why?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Inventory management is the real killer.</strong> I thought I'd have centralized storage for crafting my weapon and suit mods. And, well, I <em>do</em> (once I figured out how outputs work); there's clearly a shared inventory at each outpost, but it's a black hole. If I need to grab some resources to put in my ship cargo, or even just see how many of a particular resource I have, it's impossible without <em>manually searching all my storage bins.</em> How was this overlooked? How can an outpost have a shared inventory but we can only deposit, not view or withdraw? You mean to tell me outposts have <em>no</em> inventory management system? What sense does this make?</p>\n<p>Many of the things you'd think are no-brainers, are just missing:</p>\n<p><em>- Easy shared storage</em></p>\n<p><em>- Inter-outpost shared storage</em></p>\n<p><em>- Vendors and trading</em></p>\n<p><em>- Storing and swapping ship parts</em></p>\n<p><em>- Ship repair</em></p>\n<p><em>- Crew activities and minigames</em></p>\n<p>All of the amenities that <em>are</em> available at outposts, are available elsewhere. Sometimes better (ship building).</p>\n<p>As far as I can see, the only functional reason for outposts is extracting otherwise rare but frequently required crafting resources such as Titanium. That, and for the fun of building, which only lasts as long as you have the will and the resources to build.</p>\n<p>I've seen the supposition that outposts were originally much more central to the game, when the overall concept was more focused on survival. That makes a lot of sense, because outposts feel vestigial. The core of the system is wonderful, but without being adapted to the current direction of the game, it's just such a missed opportunity.</p></div>",

While the game does have its faults and feels unfinished in many ways, the game as it stands today is a solid 7-8/10. Y\u2019all say that as if it\u2019s a bad thing. </p>\n<p>So here\u2019s my overview of where I stand, coming from someone who enjoys every aspect of the game and am looking forward to BGS fixing all the issues that most of us agree need fixing. </p>\n<p>Been playing since official release on Xbox. Currently at 90 hours, lvl 31. I have not done a single quest line or major quest except Ryujin and I\u2019m only about half way through it. </p>\n<p>I haven\u2019t touched a single temple, I only know they exist because some of y\u2019all insist on putting spoilers in your title. </p>\n<p>The majority of my time is spent surveying planets or completing misc missions or activities. I have not been to a single lvl30 system and I haven\u2019t been to all the systems below lvl30 so still a lot to explore. I spend a lot of time doing outposts or ship building, sometimes I\u2019ll spend an hour on a ship and say fuck it and just delete it and do something else. I\u2019m not creative in the slightest so my ships usually suck. </p>\n<p>I\u2019m here to argue with you guys or we can complain together about shit that doesn\u2019t work. Use this to compare where you stand in your playthrough. Some of y\u2019all are rushing through the game and don\u2019t even realize how much you\u2019re skipping. </p>\n<p>You\u2019re welcome to play how you want but don\u2019t skip half the game then complain it\u2019s short or \u201cincomplete\u201d. Yes stuff feels unfinished but it\u2019s plenty of content for now.</p></div>",

Having to run at least 400 metres through largely barren terrain to find the same copy-pasted locations is discouraging players from this part of the game and it's especially aggravating for those who live under the impression this is the bulk of the game's content and decide to put it down altogether.</p></div>",

But I don\u2019t think that is a complete answer. Yes, vendors need more credits. But at the same time I feel that will only serve to accelerate players becoming tech mogul rich. (And let\u2019s be honest it\u2019s not hard to become stupid rich in this game) And once you have dumb money the game loses some of its grab. The struggle is some of the best part of a game. So here are my ideas for fixing the economy:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>More vendor credits. Obviously this should happen anyway. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Items need to be worth less. Who came up with these values? Why does a drink cost 400 credits or a shotgun costs 25k credits when a whole ship is like 160k? Like what? That\u2019s like saying you can have 6 shotguns or a whole car. A whole house in Akila was like 95k? That\u2019s not even 4 shotguns. What?? </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ships need to cost more. Straight up. They made it out in the Starfield Direct video that ships are end game Lego\u2019s. They don\u2019t cost nearly enough. Modifying them doesn\u2019t cost nearly enough. If they want ships to be end game, end game players are not broke. They should keep the tier system though. A parts/ships should cost less than B, which cost less than C. Focus the cost increases more heavily the higher the tier. That way early game mods to your A ship are an investment but not impossible. But late game C class ships should cost a fair amount to buy or mod. I have 2m on my character at 63 and nothing to spend it on. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A vendor in the major starports that has major credits, but only buys resources. What is the incentive to be a trucker? Or outposts for that matter? You don\u2019t need the resources to craft. Easy enough to find resources already without the outpost investment. Mass producing fancy do-dads by the 10k kg but then selling them is a bear. Give me a dedicated spaceport cargo vendor, and a reason to build a factory out of outposts.</p>\n</li>\n</ol></div>",
