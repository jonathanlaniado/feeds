It is my job. ;)</p>\n<p>I just made the switch from macOS Sequoia to macOS Tahoe (Beta 4) today, and noticed the very unpleasant surprise of everything having a 120FPS cap. In order to make sure it wasn't coming from my own code, I checked on Minecraft (which uses OpenGL) and osu!lazer (which uses Metal). And sure enough, games don't go past 120FPS anymore, regardless of which graphic API they use.</p>\n<p>However, that includes if you have a monitor running at 144Hz, 165Hz, 240Hz, etc.</p>\n<p>Reproduction steps (144Hz monitor)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Launch a Game (Metal or OpenGL)</li>\n<li>Enable vsync in game</li>\n<li>See FPS being locked to 120FPS &lt;- Wrong!</li>\n<li>Disable vsync in game</li>\n<li>See FPS being locked to 120FPS &lt;- Still wrong!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Reproduction steps (60Hz monitor)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Launch a Game (Metal or OpenGL)</li>\n<li>Enable vsync in game</li>\n<li>See FPS being locked to 60FPS</li>\n<li>Disable vsync in game</li>\n<li>See FPS being locked to 120FPS &lt;- Wrong!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Feedback has been filed, FB19023811.

An option to hide horizontal tabs when the sidebar is open for obvious reasons. 2. The sidebar should  follow the color scheme of the website as does the top bar; instead, it is only light and dark, which can look strange especially on dark websites, for example. I hope this makes sense. Very glad to see they acknowledge vertical tab management in Safari!! </p>",

One for quick system settings, another for as social options and finally one with Game Center integrations. It seems the overlay will also open via clicking on the Game Mode icon in the status bar. Several of the options then go ahead and open up more details in the overlay. Eg, viewing achievements, calling a friend, ect.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sadly there doesn't seem to be any easy way to see any performance based metrics,\u00a0 eg FPS or CPU load which typically is common on other overlays. But still seems to be a nice improvement.</p>\n<p>I also connected an Xbox remote to my Mac to test it out. At this stage, I couldn't seem to activate the overlay via the remote, however the controller could fully navigate throughout the entire overlay and interact with elements such as pausing / skipping songs. I assume controller keybindings\u00a0 might be coming later.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As far as I saw, this didn't seem to be reported anywhere yet on reddit, and I couldn't find any mention of this keybinding anyway with a quick google search so fairly sure it's new functionality to this beta, but could have been added in beta 1 or 2.</p>",

When I use the\u00a0<strong>\"Capture Selected Window\" option</strong>\u00a0from the\u00a0<code>Cmd + Shift + 5</code>\u00a0menu, the resulting PNG file has a solid white border around it instead of a transparent alpha layer that includes the window shadow.</p>\n<p>This is a problem for me as I frequently use these screenshots in my presentations for a cleaner, more aesthetic look. Now, I just get a white box, like in the example slide I've attached.</p>\n<p>I've already filed a bug report, but I wanted to see if this is a widespread issue on the latest beta or if anyone has found a potential workaround.</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p><div><br></div><img src=\"https://i.redd.it/ja91jbc5c0cf1.jpeg\" />",

While I\u2019ve noticed a couple spots where it\u2019s been toned down, I\u2019ve also been surprised to see new areas where the effect looks better than before. Hoping it stays that way.</p>\n<p>Since I can't remember, were the first two DB'2 for macOS 18 also as sluggish the first two for macOS 26 were? Or has that been more unique to macOS 26?</p>",

When drop shadows are applied to individual buttons, not only does it feel more visually cluttered but it doesn't feel like a functional component to the surface it's floating above. It feels like the floating elements like the side bar and the toolbar buttons are the most confusing because they no longer belong to the surface they're intended to interact with. </p><div><br></div><img src=\"https://i.redd.it/tpny22685qaf1.png\" />",

Noticed it for the first time today and hadn't seen any mention of it personally.</p>\n<p>Unlike the previous macOS versions, this notification doesn't stick around until you've plugged in, and in a matter of a few seconds it disappears. Not sure how I feel about that, because the persistent notification banner often was quite handy when I hit &lt;10% while AFAK. I would never miss it, whereas this quick fade in and out might be hard to miss, especially if I'm locked in focusing on a task. But visually it does look quite nice. </p>\n<p>Also note: I think the 11% in the popup is just a dev beta bug, as when I opened the battery menu bar item, it showed 9%. Alternatively this is a Day 1, 2020 MBP, that's been quite extensively, so could just be a poor reading on the aging battery. </p>",

Numerous comparisons between Developer Beta 1 and the official public version support this, indicating that the interface typically remains largely unchanged. Therefore, the notion that \u201cApple will address these issues before release\u201d may be overly optimistic.</p>\n<p>I apologize if this comes across as a rant, but I firmly believe that now is the appropriate time to voice concerns. Failing to do so risks allowing UI issues to persist into the final release, which could result in broader public criticism particularly from non-technical users who may be less forgiving of such inconsistencies. In that sense, offering constructive feedback now is not only helpful but essential to supporting Apple\u2019s goal of delivering a polished and intuitive product.</p>",
