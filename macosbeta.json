            "content_html": "<p>First off, there's a MASSIVE, and I mean MASSIVE improvement in battery life, I cannot believe how much better it is. My macbook air used to drain about 10% every 25 minutes or so of normal use in 26.0, now I've been using 26.1, and it has only drained 30% in 3.5 hours.</p>\n<p>Also, spotlight and control center, which consistently used 500-600 MB before, are now using 200/100MB respectively. Overall RAM usage seems to be quite a bit down, and the OS feels smoother, but I can't quite tell if it's actually better or it's just placebo.</p>\n<p>I also noticed some UI improvements:</p>\n<p>1: on external displays or non-notch macbooks, the menubar (when in auto-hide) FINALLY renders properly, it now has, EVERY TIME, a solid background. It's insane to me this was ever an issue in the first place but hey, something is something</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Animations are improved somewhat. The HORRID LAG when opening the notification center from the trackpad gesture (2 finger swipe from the right edge) is much less horrid (still somewhat there, but not as bad). It used to be 3fps and now it's like, 40. Also, the following animations are improved (but still not great): slide in/out animations when you open the widget pannel (though it still drops frames), closing notifications from a group of notifications (where the blur/scale down is used, instead of the \"disperse glass\" that's used for single notifications or whole notification groups), opening control center tiles (it's less linear and a bit smoother, still really bad though, specially  to iOS). Also, the subtle blur+opacity animation when opening/closing windows is applied every time now (yay!)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There's also a new animation for control center: it first blurs, and then the toggles progressively \"fade down\" into the scene. It's pretty short and subtle, which is very good on the mac. Coupled with the (now) widely applied opening and closing window animations, make the OS feel substantially smoother at no cost in speed (since the animations are very quick and unintrusive)</p>\n<p>EDIT: Yeah, it's DEFINITELY smoother, The mission control, stage manager and control center animations specially, but overall animations are so much better. There's some other UI improvements too \ud83e\udd73, like inspector bars in Finder now have concentric radius in all four corners, and the '+' button at the left corner of the preview sidebar for pdfs is finally correctly rendered, it doesn't cut out into the border anymore, the pathbar on finder is FINALLY the same material as the status bar and solid toolbars (it was a different material and it was making me insane)</p>",

These are present since the beginning of the developer beta program and I have reported them to the feedback app already.</p>\n<p>I feel like the UI of MacOS is getting less consistent. E.g. the segmented controls (shown in the video) are sometimes liquid glass with nice animations, and sometimes not. In the keynote, they also made a big deal about \"concentricity\", and how every border radius should be perfectly calculated so it matches the radius of the parent container. But again, some UI elements like shown below don't follow this rule.</p>\n<p>Also, Liquid Glass on iPad feels much more \"fluid\" and \"liquid\" than on Mac.</p>\n<p>I hope this will get fixed until the final release, but I have to say, I am little concerned since the last few betas didn't include many notable changes. Hopefully, they can give MacOS a bit more attention after the iOS release.</p>\n<p>Here are some examples:</p>\n<p>The language selection menu is missing the Liquid Glass background:</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/i3o7mri00tmf1.png?width=746&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f90c283ecd0de3d4f3fd6876dc215b7cfd4a4508</p>\n<p>The border radius of the hover state is not concentric to the parent container:</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/c38yd2750tmf1.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=accf1c05dbe398cb933767b99dd1100e3fbfc0ca</p>\n<p>Some menus are still missing Liquid Glass background:</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/kig7zp6b0tmf1.png?width=688&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d5795a22308e563a4f3a91037ddf409036bea36</p>\n<p>Here the concentricity is completely off again:</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/okhbzb9f0tmf1.png?width=1422&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=226840d9dffc294135dd22e5d553c8b903000720</p>\n<p>Some segmented controls are made out of Liquid Glass and have nice animations, while others have not:</p>\n<p>https://reddit.com/link/1n6tjwv/video/kkmsp9dw0tmf1/player</p>\n<p>Being made out of \"liquid\" glass, it would be nice if the toolbar items would show some \"liquid\" animations like on iOS and iPadOS:</p>\n<p>https://reddit.com/link/1n6tjwv/video/hqo7to2f2tmf1/player</p>",

That's where many of Apple's wallpapers/screensavers are bright due to having sky there. Which means it's extra important that desktop item text is legible on bright backgrounds, and always having the text be white (even when the menu bar understands that black is the only way to go) doesn't help.</p>\n<p>Worse, the black blur overlay that sits behind the menu text to improve contrast is placed <em>in front of</em> the desktop items, adding a grey tint over text that's barely legible to begin with. Surely that layer order can't be right. At least, this is what happens with the topmost Desktop item on non-Retina displays, as the first pic illustrates. If you look at the 2nd picture which is MBP 16\" native res (Retina), the overlay doesn't seem to be in front of the icon and text.</p>\n<p>I'm not affected personally as I always use dark wallpapers, but for people who prefer brighter ones this has to be an issue.

So, here's how you can achieve a similar menu, in case you didn't know:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Drag and drop the Applications folder from the Finder in the right/lower side of the dock (Macintosh HD &gt; Applications)</li>\n<li>Control + click it and set \"view content as\" to \"Grid\".</li>\n<li>Make smaller folders inside the Applications folder in Finder to organize your apps however you want.</li>\n<li>With the new folder customization coming in macOS Tahoe, you can also set any icon or emoji as well as a color for easier distinction between the folders.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There is a caveat, though: Organizing your apps into different folders only works with third-party apps, not with Apple's own, preinstalled ones.</p>",

I hope this makes sense. Very glad to see they acknowledge vertical tab management in Safari!! </p>",

One for quick system settings, another for as social options and finally one with Game Center integrations. It seems the overlay will also open via clicking on the Game Mode icon in the status bar. Several of the options then go ahead and open up more details in the overlay. Eg, viewing achievements, calling a friend, ect.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sadly there doesn't seem to be any easy way to see any performance based metrics,\u00a0 eg FPS or CPU load which typically is common on other overlays. But still seems to be a nice improvement.</p>\n<p>I also connected an Xbox remote to my Mac to test it out. At this stage, I couldn't seem to activate the overlay via the remote, however the controller could fully navigate throughout the entire overlay and interact with elements such as pausing / skipping songs. I assume controller keybindings\u00a0 might be coming later.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As far as I saw, this didn't seem to be reported anywhere yet on reddit, and I couldn't find any mention of this keybinding anyway with a quick google search so fairly sure it's new functionality to this beta, but could have been added in beta 1 or 2.</p>",
