An option to hide horizontal tabs when the sidebar is open for obvious reasons. 2. The sidebar should  follow the color scheme of the website as does the top bar; instead, it is only light and dark, which can look strange especially on dark websites, for example. I hope this makes sense. Very glad to see they acknowledge vertical tab management in Safari!! </p>",

One for quick system settings, another for as social options and finally one with Game Center integrations. It seems the overlay will also open via clicking on the Game Mode icon in the status bar. Several of the options then go ahead and open up more details in the overlay. Eg, viewing achievements, calling a friend, ect.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sadly there doesn't seem to be any easy way to see any performance based metrics,\u00a0 eg FPS or CPU load which typically is common on other overlays. But still seems to be a nice improvement.</p>\n<p>I also connected an Xbox remote to my Mac to test it out. At this stage, I couldn't seem to activate the overlay via the remote, however the controller could fully navigate throughout the entire overlay and interact with elements such as pausing / skipping songs. I assume controller keybindings\u00a0 might be coming later.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As far as I saw, this didn't seem to be reported anywhere yet on reddit, and I couldn't find any mention of this keybinding anyway with a quick google search so fairly sure it's new functionality to this beta, but could have been added in beta 1 or 2.</p>",

When I use the\u00a0<strong>\"Capture Selected Window\" option</strong>\u00a0from the\u00a0<code>Cmd + Shift + 5</code>\u00a0menu, the resulting PNG file has a solid white border around it instead of a transparent alpha layer that includes the window shadow.</p>\n<p>This is a problem for me as I frequently use these screenshots in my presentations for a cleaner, more aesthetic look. Now, I just get a white box, like in the example slide I've attached.</p>\n<p>I've already filed a bug report, but I wanted to see if this is a widespread issue on the latest beta or if anyone has found a potential workaround.</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p><div><br></div><img src=\"https://i.redd.it/ja91jbc5c0cf1.jpeg\" />",

Noticed it for the first time today and hadn't seen any mention of it personally.</p>\n<p>Unlike the previous macOS versions, this notification doesn't stick around until you've plugged in, and in a matter of a few seconds it disappears. Not sure how I feel about that, because the persistent notification banner often was quite handy when I hit &lt;10% while AFAK. I would never miss it, whereas this quick fade in and out might be hard to miss, especially if I'm locked in focusing on a task. But visually it does look quite nice. </p>\n<p>Also note: I think the 11% in the popup is just a dev beta bug, as when I opened the battery menu bar item, it showed 9%. Alternatively this is a Day 1, 2020 MBP, that's been quite extensively, so could just be a poor reading on the aging battery. </p>",

Numerous comparisons between Developer Beta 1 and the official public version support this, indicating that the interface typically remains largely unchanged. Therefore, the notion that \u201cApple will address these issues before release\u201d may be overly optimistic.</p>\n<p>I apologize if this comes across as a rant, but I firmly believe that now is the appropriate time to voice concerns. Failing to do so risks allowing UI issues to persist into the final release, which could result in broader public criticism particularly from non-technical users who may be less forgiving of such inconsistencies. In that sense, offering constructive feedback now is not only helpful but essential to supporting Apple\u2019s goal of delivering a polished and intuitive product.</p>",

Notably, all icons are presented in their light versions only.</p>\n<p>To my understanding, the recent implementation by Apple for rendering icons has made it challenging, if not impossible, to extract all color variants. Previously, application icons were stored in the Content/Resources folder, which is no longer applicable. This folder contains outdated static files from the pre-OS 26 era. Icons are no longer static.</p>\n<p>Icon creation is now managed through Icon Composer. During the development process, developers are no longer required to include static images in the assets/AppIcon set. Instead, the Icon Composer project file is directly copied to the Xcode application\u2019s project folder. Upon compilation, the system receives instructions on how to dynamically render the icon.</p>\n<p>Enjoy and have a beautiful day!</p>",
