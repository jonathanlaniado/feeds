Noticed it for the first time today and hadn't seen any mention of it personally.</p>\n<p>Unlike the previous macOS versions, this notification doesn't stick around until you've plugged in, and in a matter of a few seconds it disappears. Not sure how I feel about that, because the persistent notification banner often was quite handy when I hit &lt;10% while AFAK. I would never miss it, whereas this quick fade in and out might be hard to miss, especially if I'm locked in focusing on a task. But visually it does look quite nice. </p>\n<p>Also note: I think the 11% in the popup is just a dev beta bug, as when I opened the battery menu bar item, it showed 9%. Alternatively this is a Day 1, 2020 MBP, that's been quite extensively, so could just be a poor reading on the aging battery. </p>",

Numerous comparisons between Developer Beta 1 and the official public version support this, indicating that the interface typically remains largely unchanged. Therefore, the notion that \u201cApple will address these issues before release\u201d may be overly optimistic.</p>\n<p>I apologize if this comes across as a rant, but I firmly believe that now is the appropriate time to voice concerns. Failing to do so risks allowing UI issues to persist into the final release, which could result in broader public criticism particularly from non-technical users who may be less forgiving of such inconsistencies. In that sense, offering constructive feedback now is not only helpful but essential to supporting Apple\u2019s goal of delivering a polished and intuitive product.</p>",

If anyone is interested in downloading new macOS Tahoe system icons, <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Hl9x6TIonjnKirn3bu0gJXRhDLpuIIT4?usp=share_link\">you can do so here.</a></p>\n<p>I have put together a list of all the icons I could find. Notably, all icons are presented in their light versions only.</p>\n<p>To my understanding, the recent implementation by Apple for rendering icons has made it challenging, if not impossible, to extract all color variants. Previously, application icons were stored in the Content/Resources folder, which is no longer applicable. This folder contains outdated static files from the pre-OS 26 era. Icons are no longer static.</p>\n<p>Icon creation is now managed through Icon Composer. During the development process, developers are no longer required to include static images in the assets/AppIcon set. Instead, the Icon Composer project file is directly copied to the Xcode application\u2019s project folder. Upon compilation, the system receives instructions on how to dynamically render the icon.</p>\n<p>Enjoy and have a beautiful day!</p>",
