Sadly, it stopped working recently. It also wasn't making use of the build in collection list of Radarr v3.</p>\n<p>So, I felt it was time for something new, and I started creating Collectarr.</p>\n<p>It's first, and main goal is, to check all movies in your Radarr collection, check if they are part of a collection, and add a list for that collection. To my surprise, all needed info was available within Radarr itself, and the tool was finished in a few hours.</p>\n<p>While I was at it, I thought to myself: It would be nice if I can manage some actors as well, but how? I decided I would look up (on TMDB) all actors for all movies in Radarr, check how many movies in Radarr they are in, and make a list if the number is high enough.</p>\n<p>Features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make a list for every collection you have at least 1 movie in Radarr</li>\n<li>Make a list for every actor staring in a set amount of movies in Radarr</li>\n<li>Some list cleanup functions. Be very careful with them, there is 1 removing all lists</li>\n<li>Dry-run to test without making changes to Radarr</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is a very early beta, as far as I know it is only tested on my test and main install. Please feel free to ask questions, suggest new features and report bugs.</p>\n<p>I am not responsible for anything that happens using this software. I always suggest you make a backup of your Radarr install before running, and do a dry-run and verify the result before actually changing anything in Radarr.</p>\n<p>Download (<a href=\"https://github.com/RiffSphere/Collectarr/releases/tag/v0.1.0.1\">https://github.com/RiffSphere/Collectarr/releases/tag/v0.1.0.1</a>)</p>\n<p>Docker just need a /config mount</p>\n<ul>\n<li>docker pull riffsphere/collectarr</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Full description on the config in the file and on github.</p></div>",
