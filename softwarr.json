This is done by library only at the moment. So all films in your selected 3D library will have banners added.</p>\n<p>4K_hdr_poster script allows for changning poster art, it will recreate the backup as long as it doesn't detect a 4k banner.</p>\n<p>restore poster script will restore all posters from backup not just 4k HDR posters.</p>\n<h2>Description</h2>\n<h2>Automatically add 4k/HDR Banner</h2>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>https://i.redd.it/1jm35itmsgr71.gif</p>\n<p>This will go through your library and automatically add a 4k banner at the top of your posters. It will also add a HDR logo so you can easily see which of your files are HDR at a glance. This can be disabled in the config file.</p>\n<p>The script will download the poster that you have set for your media and add the banners meaning you can still have curated posters. It will also make a backup of your posters next to the media files so the posters can be restored easily.</p>\n<p>In order to use this script you will need your plex media volumes mounted.</p>\n<p>Change this in the config.ini file and add the location of the local directory where your plex media is located. You will need read/write access to this directory.</p>\n<p>If your paths are the same or you are running the script on the same machine as your plex server make sure that both entries in the config file match otherwise you will get an error.</p>\n<h2>Optional</h2>\n<p>Now there is the option to use a minified 4k logo if you don't want to have the full width banner on your posters. Set mini-4k to true in the config file.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/dffwd8wzsgr71.png?width=911&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a906ecc55773fc221a241aaa1f6efdef04e7b96</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/bny2z8i1tgr71.png?width=911&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=128f203315477f8ed5ce762e97c08f7a965d79e4</p>\n<h2>Hide-4k Files</h2>\n<p>The plex streaming brain has come on a long way and I believe it's no longer necessary to separate your 4k files into a separate library.</p>\n<p>There is still the risk, when keeping all your media in a single library, of having a film where the only copy is 4k. In this case running the hide-4k script will add an 'Untranscodable' tag to these items.</p>\n<p>If you add a lower resolution to your library it will remove the tag.</p>\n<p>You will need to set the restrictions in your users profile to exclude the 'Untranscodable' label.</p>\n<p>Run this script on a regular basis to keep on top of your library.</p>\n<h2>Optional</h2>\n<p>Set transcode to True in the config file. This will send your 4k only files to be optimised through plex. The setting for this is 1080p 10mbps. This is not reccomended on low powered hardware.</p>\n<h2>Disney/Pixar collection</h2>\n<p>This is a script to find all films in your library with a studio having Disney in the studio's title, e.g. Walt Disney Pictures or Disney animation. It then adds all of these films into a collection named Disney.</p>\n<p>It then does the same for Pixar</p>\n<h1>Docker install</h1>\n<p>I have created a docker container for ease of use, epecially for people who aren't comfortable with Python.</p>\n<p>To run the container enter the following:</p>\n<p>docker run -d --name=Plex-utills -v </your/plex/media/folder>:/films -v /<your config directory>:/config jkirkcaldy/plex-utills</p>\n<p>Or you can use docker-compose. An example file is located in the repository.</p>\n<p>All configuration is done in the config file.</p>\n<h1>Manual Install</h1>\n<h2>Requirements</h2>\n<p>Python3 python3-pip</p>\n<p>sudo apt install python3 python3-pip</p>\n<h2>Instructions</h2>\n<p>Clone to your machine sudo git clone <a href=\"https://github.com/jkirkcaldy/plex-utills.git\">https://github.com/jkirkcaldy/plex-utills.git</a></p>\n<p>Cd into the folder cd plex-utills</p>\n<p>install the requirements sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt</p>\n<p>Edit the config.ini file, change the plex url and the plex token and select your film library.</p>\n<p>Run the script. python3 4klibrary.py</p>\n<h2>Optional</h2>\n<p>Set cron job to run the script daily to automatically run the script and organise your library</p></div>",

Sadly, it stopped working recently. It also wasn't making use of the build in collection list of Radarr v3.</p>\n<p>So, I felt it was time for something new, and I started creating Collectarr.</p>\n<p>It's first, and main goal is, to check all movies in your Radarr collection, check if they are part of a collection, and add a list for that collection. To my surprise, all needed info was available within Radarr itself, and the tool was finished in a few hours.</p>\n<p>While I was at it, I thought to myself: It would be nice if I can manage some actors as well, but how? I decided I would look up (on TMDB) all actors for all movies in Radarr, check how many movies in Radarr they are in, and make a list if the number is high enough.</p>\n<p>Features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make a list for every collection you have at least 1 movie in Radarr</li>\n<li>Make a list for every actor staring in a set amount of movies in Radarr</li>\n<li>Some list cleanup functions. Be very careful with them, there is 1 removing all lists</li>\n<li>Dry-run to test without making changes to Radarr</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is a very early beta, as far as I know it is only tested on my test and main install. Please feel free to ask questions, suggest new features and report bugs.</p>\n<p>I am not responsible for anything that happens using this software. I always suggest you make a backup of your Radarr install before running, and do a dry-run and verify the result before actually changing anything in Radarr.</p>\n<p>Download (<a href=\"https://github.com/RiffSphere/Collectarr/releases/tag/v0.1.0.1\">https://github.com/RiffSphere/Collectarr/releases/tag/v0.1.0.1</a>)</p>\n<p>Docker just need a /config mount</p>\n<ul>\n<li>docker pull riffsphere/collectarr</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Full description on the config in the file and on github.</p></div>",
