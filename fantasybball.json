I call it \"Trade Tuesday\". I usually (not always) send out six trades (maximum that yahoo allows) in most of my leagues and continue conversations from previous weeks or start up new ones. (I save all kinds of notes so I know how each manager values players which helps you get a deal done). Sometimes people counter with a good offer that you surprisingly didn't expect! For me this is still my Tuesday night even though I'm aware that technically it is Wednesday. Warning that this is my most speculative post in my history and you will very rarely ever see this much speculation from me! So... </p>\n<p>What are some of your players that you are targeting right now both to TRADE AWAY or TRADE FOR?</p>\n<p>My TRADE FOR: (for my team build) it's James Harden, Scottie Barnes, Fox, Sabonis, (that SAC playoffs schedule!!!), Evan Mobley (CLE great schedule too), Gafford, Tre Jones (still don't have enough of him despite being on many of my teams), Ben Simmons (you can laugh, but he does have significant upside in a punt pts build). Zubacs. Poeltl. Okongwu. Rudy Gobert but it is hard to pry him away and I don't want to give up too much, but still trying to trade for him. One of my negotiations for him the owner trying to really rip me off and I wont' have that! </p>\n<p>Trying to TRADE AWAY: Jimmy Butler, Derrick Lively (cuz the two game playoff week), Jrue Holiday because I want more AST than what he is providing, Anfernee Simons Id like to move... I have entertained the idea of Haliburton for Harden but haven't fully made that offer. (Of course I would need extra in return) </p>\n<p>A trade that I did make!!! Last week I traded with my \"Rival\" (From baseball where we both faced off in two different public money leagues in the championship game! I won one, he won the other!) I traded away Okongwu for Ben Simmons. (Might regret that move and truly I already do considering the Capela injury), but I quickly replaced the Okongwu FG%, REBS and BLOCKS with Nick Richards so it was a net gain for my team! (Big reason why I made the trade) Ben Simmons is unique pizza with unique toppings (Punt PTS, FT%, THREES) who doesn't fit everyone (and you might be allergic) so no this isn't a glowing endorsement for everyone to go trade for Simmons. lol. (He has looked great in a few of his games now though even though clearly he will see rest games too often) He is an injury risk with his \"epidural required\" pregnancy back, yet plenty of upside too. He has only 13 games left from today Feb 7th to March 17th then those playoffs begin (for standard leagues) I'm factoring in that he will miss 5 back to back games in this span to keep him rested/healthy. (You may want to check those upcoming games played schedule too when you are considering trades. Some players will \"get you into the playoffs\" by playing more games and some players are more impactful when those playoffs begin)   </p>\n<p>It is worth mentioning that now might be a good time for some fantasy teams to pivot into a punt build... (You should be able to identify your team weaknesses and strong stats. You can use the tools on basketball monster team analysis page or you can also look up the team stats page if on yahoo) You may have too many injuries to compete in PTS categories or other counting stats like THREES, AST. Might be something to consider... It really would depend who is on your roster and injuries and your position in standings. Also how good you at working the wavier wire/streaming as well as who could be long term valuable to add/trade for. </p>\n<p>As the wise phrase goes, \"Sometimes the best trades we make are the trades WE DO NOT MAKE\". Some of your teams you may already have a super strong team and no need to trade.  </p>\n<p>-----  </p>\n<p>I also want to take a few moments to talk about the real NBA teams and some of the moves that might occur. Players that could have extra value if they were moved or players who would jump into a larger role on same team if others were moved: (An extremely nutty tough thing to tackle)   </p>\n<p>Andre Drummond. This is the number 1 stash target. He is being rumored to be involved in numerous trades. Where there is smoke there is usually a fire. And we have seen his fantasy upside when he gets starters minutes. If your team needs rebounds, steals, blocks, FG% he is a great speculative add in case he gets into a larger role because the upside is worth it. Then we saw him go absolutely nuts on Tuesday with 16pts, 16reb, 4blocks! I believe this was them showcasing him for a trade! They claimed it was to matchup with the twin towers of Gobert and KAT, but come on now, I think most of us know the real reason. They absolutely just  increased his trade appeal. I'm almost 100% certain he will be moved. But then again the bulls might bull. LOL.   </p>\n<p>Trayce Jackson Davis. If Looney and/or Wiggins was shipped off I believe it would give him a larger role. We have already see him do very well for his FG% and some blocks. If he could carve out a role around 6-7 rebs per game and over a block per game he would be fantasy worthy end of bench type of player and as we know the warriors extremely great schedule going forward from now all the way to rest of season. Same things can be said for Podziemski.   </p>\n<p>Dejounte Murray. Well it is rumored mostly with the Lakers and a DeAngelo Russell trade. I think it would downgrade Murray if that were to occur since he would get less rebounds and less scoring on the lakers team. Deangelo scoring would go up as Trae would find him often and he would be the 2nd scoring option. I guess it is possible they bring him in off the bench, but I reckon they would start him at SG. This trade may not go down too and there are other talks/negotiations occurring!   </p>\n<p>Scoot Henderson. We have seen flashes of upside on what Scoot can do with high volume of getting to the line and high amount of assists and high scoring usage. I do think the turnovers and low FG% will likely still be a problem all season, but for some of you those might be categories you are already punting. Even if brogdon stays in POR (and it seems likely lately that he may stay) you gotta think they let the young kid Scoot play a whole lot more rest of the way...   </p>\n<p>The MIL bucks. They are seeking \"upgrades\". So whoever they bring in as \"upgrades\" will be interesting and useful. Why? Because MIL has an incredible zesty playoff schedule the week of March 25th where they play TUES/THURS/SAT. Three quality games! Extremely beneficial for that week. It WILL catapult teams into winning that week if you have 2 or 3 players from them. There might be other higher value targets that move at deadline, but DO KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON MILWAUKEE. (same for New Orleans with same exact schedule, but they aren't linked as to actively looking for upgrades like MIL currently is) The main rumor is they are looking for a guard who can defend. (Caruso?). Also worth mentioning that Portis for Grant Williams was discussed between DAL and MIL... Pat Connaughton has an expiring contract and doesn't seem like a major part of their future so he is likely to be moved. Dorian Finney Smith has been linked to this and I wonder if Dinwiddie would also be included? (but his defense is bad) Also major injury to Middleton just occurred last night so I expect bucks to be VERY active buyers. </p>\n<p>Coulibaly. There are rumors that wizards may trade Kuzma to DAL. This would give Coulibaly minutes as a starter which might be good for his role. However if Tyus Jones is moved he wouldn't have as good of a passer around him. The wizards point guard situation could be completely different with both Tyus and Delon likely to be traded. Would this mean wizards would be going with \"point Deni\" as ballhandler? Might they start Kispert? Or will they bring in another guard via trade to start? Lots of dominoes...   </p>\n<p>Dorian Finney Smith/Royce ONeal trade rumors and how it benefits Ben Simmons. What do I mean? Well Ben is best when he is surrounded by pure shooters where his passing skills play up and he doesn't get as exposed for his lack of a jump shot. He also is benefited by someone who is fast/can run the floor on fast breaks with him. So if they bring in some shooters his value goes up cuz it seems he will be coming off the bench? (oh boy, way too much Ben Simmons talk in this post and I know those haters exist all over!) It is worth mentioning that if Dinwiddie is traded away Simmons would do very well as a starter...   </p>\n<p>Wiggins being rumored to the pacers or Mavs. This would boost his value IF it was to the Mavs (by playing with good passers Luka and Kyrie and being the third scoring option on that team) and various dominoes would fall depending on where he landed. Podziemski would have more security for minutes (depending on who would come back).  </p>\n<p>Jalen Green is in trade rumors. This could open even more doors for Amen Thompson or even Cam Whitmore. (Of course depending on who comes back) The nets were supposedly in talks with HOU.   </p>\n<p>Tyus Jones. He has been linked to talks with Lakers. I think if that happened his ast would go up. Approaching 8 or 9 per game with Lebron and AD around him. His scoring would come down a bit though and rebs go down/stay low. He has also been linked to Timberwolves where I would expect him to backup Conley? Or Conley would move to bench. It would certainly be a downgrade for whichever player comes off the bench.   </p>\n<p>Delon Wright. There are rumors about him possibly going to the kings. If that happened remember him as a streamer in playoffs due to schedule if begins on March 18th. (Celtics and Timberwolves also interested). There is also the short term value the kings have this week as they play FRI and SUN combo. Instead of keeping a fringe player on your bench for SAT you are more benefited to stream in a player who gets two games on those days. (The Celtics is the other team with that feature)   </p>\n<p>Celtics are looking for bench upgrades (obviously gee what a shock, lol) Just as I mentioned this could be quickly relevant for streaming right away this week FRI and SUN. (As well as maybe long term) So pay attention to it.   </p>\n<p>Jalen Brunson just hurt his ankle. Not sure of severity yet, but they did bring in Malachi Flynn a few weeks ago and I reckon he might step up, but also they might look to bring in another point guard as well. McBride could also step in and they just use Divincenzo and hart as the main ballhandlers? No doubt Knicks have playoff aspirations so I would expect them to be buyers? Maybe they go after Brogdon? (Knicks might need a replacement big man with Randle going down and uncertainty timeline of Robinson or is Precious the answer?!? He has looked good lately hasn't he? Maybe they are showcasing him for a trade too? Or maybe he has calmed that with his strong play?) The knicks have discussed a deal involving Bruce Brown for Evan Fournier and draft considerations.   </p>\n<p>Bruce Brown and Gary Trent Jr are looking to be moved by the Raptors. I would think they are looking to bring more scoring help to Scottie Barnes?   </p>\n<p>Kelly Olynyk expiring contract. Also might be on the move is Sexton? This could open up doors for Keyonte and a bit maybe for Kessler.   </p>\n<p>Monte Morris is highly likely to be traded and could be a name in deeper leagues that might find himself a quality role 4ish ast per game as a backup.   </p>\n<p>Kyle Lowry. Similar to Morris he could himself as a quality backup. (Might even be a starter? Sort of doubt it though) The hornets could also part ways with expiring contract of Gordon Hayward? Clearly they are sellers at deadline. PJ Washington is rumored as a target for the Mavs... That would clearly increase his value...Something to watch...   </p>\n<p>Chris Boucher. He appears set to be moved and has accepted/almost excited about it. He isn't part of the Raptors future plans. The MAVS are looking for a PF so this could be a real option that may materialize? We shall see...   </p>\n<p>Luke Kennard. Even though they aren't really showcasing him, he is a pure shooter. They might not be able to afford him next year and they don't need him for this year so it makes sense to turn the asset into something more for the future (next year or beyond) They already shipped away Steven Adams for the same luxury tax reason so it might make sense for them to do the same with Kennard. (Although I disagree and think they should have kept Steven Adams since they literally are very empty with bigs right now and Adams is damn good at setting screens and capable passer and defender despite lack of post moves/offensive game) Maybe that's the type of trade they will seek out is for big man? He should attract attention because of his skill set is always desired in the NBA. A landing spot could be Celtics as a bench scoring option maybe?   </p>\n<p>Bones Hyland. He might go to the Timberwolves as their backup point guard. (same executive who drafted him now runs Timberwolves) Ok cool. Deep leaguers that might be useful.   </p>\n<p>Of note: Players who DO move likely are NOT playing in the Thursday game they have scheduled and probably might not even play in the Friday game so pay attention to that with who you choose to stream. (Generally best not to stream until after the deadline, for future reference/future years) Each team has needs, wants and then there is the salary cap to make it complicated. So it is harder to get deals done then you think it is!!! Some various \"throw in\" players will be moved as salary dump plays and some other players might be included in trades in order to stay under the salary cap (despite not being a perfect fit for the new team). I think we could see some real unique lineups here (grizzlies style? nah grizzlies are seemingly just experimenting with stuff?) on Wednesday as teams \"showcase players for a trade\"... Could mean higher usage for players that teams are trying to move... (Kennard 60 point game incoming, book it, LOL. It's funny, but the dude was actually insane in high school) (Probably more of a DFS situation to pay attention to rather than season long leagues, but it might affect your overs/under lines too) </p>\n<p>With all of that said, What are some of your trade plans and your negotiations today/this week? Are you waiting to trade until after the NBA trade deadline? (Probably the best move) Are you still negotiating? What players are you stashing/adding in hopes they get traded at the deadline?  What rumors do you think have the most credence? What are players you think are on the move and the ramifications? Let's discuss? Remember that rumors are exactly that, SPECULATION and not facts. (Winning fantasy basketball is undeniably more about focusing on the facts) And truly factually I must say that you shouldn't be making moves based on speculation unless that upside is worth it and/or your league is hyper competitive and you are worried you might miss out on a player. Those are the situations that it might be worth it. Last year Mark Williams was a massive winner at the deadline and many people correctly stashed him in advance of it! Most years though, things do not work out that way... A forewarning...   </p>\n<p>If you have questions will try to reply to your questions, but I do have alot going on today and at my real job I work late into the evenings so I apologize if it takes me extra time to respond. (Fantasy trades should be carefully analyzed anyway and not to rush it) Let's have some fun with this!!! </p>",

This man is a lock for the fantasy basketball bust hall of fame. A trade provided a fresh start for Poole, and seemingly opened up plenty of usage for him. Many were very high on him this year, he was pretty much a unanimous top 50 draft pick. He is hitting rock bottoms few  could have imagined before the season began. His downfall demands to be studied, and I continue to be fascinated by it.</p>",

(Still alive technically, but ouch) I will need to string together a bunch of 6-3 wins (maybe a few 5-4) and really with this squad that is VERY difficult. Anyway here is the update on moves!   </p>\n<p>I dropped:</p>\n<p>WCJ (obvious) </p>\n<p>Jared Vanderbilt (streamer)  </p>\n<p>Coulibaly (may look to re-add)   </p>\n<p>I added:</p>\n<p>Trayce Jackson Davis  </p>\n<p>Mitchell Robinson (IL stash) </p>\n<p>Pat Connaughton (schedule stream)   </p>\n<p>Also should mention last week adds because I didn't do an update last week... I scooped up ANDRE DRUMMOND for 12 faab! Yeah boy! I re-added Podziemski on Christmas Day for 6 faab. Then Paul Reed and Jared Vanderbilt were streamed in.   </p>\n<p>So now the team update as it stands right now and why I roster them:  </p>\n<p>PG Tyus Jones (FG% for guard, STLS, TO)</p>\n<p>SG Matisse Thybulle (elite steals/blocks, TO)</p>\n<p>G Brandin Podziemski (FG% for guard, REBS for guard, STL) </p>\n<p>SF Tari Eason (REBS, STLS, BLOCKS) </p>\n<p>PF Trayce Jackson-Davis (FG%, BLOCKS) </p>\n<p>F Josh Hart (FG%, REBS, sorta STLS)</p>\n<p>C Okongwu (FG%, REBS, BLOCKS, FT%)</p>\n<p>C Isiah Hartenstein (FG%, REBS, STLS for a big, BLOCKS)</p>\n<p>UTL Nick Richards (FG%, REBS, BLOCKS)</p>\n<p>UTL Andre Drummond (FG%, REBS, STLS, BLOCKS) </p>\n<p>Bnch Derrick Lively (FG%, REBS, BLOCKS) soon to be IL.</p>\n<p>Bnch Cole Anthony (REBS for guard, FT% volume)</p>\n<p>Bnch Pat Connaughton (schedule shenanigan streamer)</p>\n<p>IL Mitchell Robinson  </p>\n<p>I lost last week 3-6 because I only won FG%, REBS, TO. It was a real close battle for steals and blocks. My current matchup (against the 2nd place team)  I\"m ahead 5-4 as I lead FG%, REBS, STLS, BLOCKS TO exactly how things SHOULD go... I'm way behind in FT%. Way behind in AST, way behind in PTS and THREES as usual. I got hit with empty roster spots on WED with Cole Anthony not playing and Tari Eason not playing. (One reason I dropped Coulibaly is because he would have been on my bench and I thought Eason would be in there WED). Drummond and Hartenstein been huge for me this week! </p>\n<p>Isiah Jackson might be an option at PF. Draymond Green is also available (but I am punting AST). I might replace G Cole Anthony with SG Ausar Thompson and hope he regains his previous form? (I don't think Cole Anthony and Okongwu are enough to win FT%, but it's \"possible\" I suppose) I do need to have possibility of winning FT%...So might hold... Goga is also available and I do want to re add him for his useful skills. He could slot in to replace Lively.. (Those moves have to be made next week though since I only have one left for this week and it will be used for a Sunday streamer for Connaughton. (Schedule also dictates my moves so I can get max games) I could possibly trade Tyus Jones since he is my greatest \"rank value\" asset and really only brings me FG% and STLS as things I utilize, I really need those steals though! I'm already extremely strong in FG%... I wonder if I need to be able to win FT% each week... To do that would entail trading for Colin Sexton for his high FT% at high volume... (Sexton is a target for me cuz he shouldn't be as hard to obtain as someone like Jimmy Butler or other high FT% guys) This could give me the upside again of being able to win FG%, REBS, BLOCKS, TO, STLS, FT% total of 6 cats... And if somehow I can magically string enough 6 cat wins together I would be in the playoffs!!! (The odds of that of course are low). Still a chance! NEVER GIVE UP!   </p>\n<p>Stay tuned for an update on the team next week! </p>",

Even Josh Lloyd, who spends a good amount of time on the value of almost every player, hardly ever goes in-depth on Bojan. </p>\n<p>His production recently has been extremely concerning but I think he would have to have three single digit scoring games in a row for anyone to notice. Lloyd is fixated on players like Klay (rightfully) and Curry &amp; Butler (confusingly) being washed but he never mentions the guy who went from 49-41-88 shooting splits last season to 45-38-74 shooting splits so far this season. He got off to an odd start getting like 3 steals in a few games but now has had 2 over the last 9 games. He doesn\u2019t get rebounds or assists with any type of reliability other than an outlier game every once in a while. </p>\n<p>I know he\u2019s bigger and has typically been more reliable in the past few years than these guys but I don\u2019t see much of a difference between the value of guys like Klay or Jordan Clarkson and him. He\u2019s had a serious decline thus far. I thankfully avoided him in 9CAT but was excited for his value in points. Well\u2026 he\u2019s averaging 27.1 fantasy points in my league and I\u2019m really considering dropping him since there are more exciting guys on the wire.</p>\n<p>What do you guys think of Bojan?</p>",
