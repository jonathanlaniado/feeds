(Without anyone else influencing me, this is straight from me and my initial thoughts)</p>\n<p>Clippers vs Jazz </p>\n<p>Bit of an upset win for the jazz as clippers looked fantastic in their first game. Clippers shot better FG% (53%), however Jazz shot 90% from the free throw line which was likely the big difference. Let's take a look at the players. </p>\n<p>Covington, tiny usage, but did have 2 steals. </p>\n<p>Paul George, 15-15 FTM!!! ELITE! Shot well FG close to 50% with 36pts, hit 3threes, 4rebs, 1ast. Not a shock he does this, we seen in his past. I guess few downside are he had low ast and no defensive stats (typically he will tho). </p>\n<p>Kawhi Leonard, refer to PG13. 25pts, 9rebs, 4threes, 5ast, 2stl and only 1 turnover! Technically more well rounded game than PG13. </p>\n<p>Zubacs, bit of a down game with only 6pts, 2rebs, 2blocks. Don't panic. </p>\n<p>Westbrook racked up boards. 9rebs, 4ast, 1stl, 1block, only 4pts and in recent years westbrook fashion 5 bad turnovers. (again he is better in a pts league) </p>\n<p>Powell contributed 20pts off bench on 70% shooting plus 100% from the line. </p>\n<p>Batum was helpful with big bench mins of 30 and scored 8pts, 2rebs, 3ast, 1stl, 3blocks. (you love that defense!) </p>\n<p>for the jazz: </p>\n<p>Lauri Markkanen did exactly what we expected from the 2nd rounder. 35pts on over 50% shooting, 100% FTM, 5threes, 12rebs, 3ast. </p>\n<p>John Collins had a nice double double 13pts, 12rebs, 1block, and 100% from the line. </p>\n<p>Walker Kessler is a bit of a concern. This is 2 games now that are less than stellar and kinda bad. 7pts, 4rebs and 1 three. (why are you shooting threes? hmmm to me that harms his high FG% value). I may try to put feelers out there in trades, but you don't want to sell on Kessler too darn low so... I'm a bit worried. Is John Collins stealing his rebounds? I do want to say \"don't panic, it's only 2 games\" but he is getting limited minutes too!!! (only 21 here). I'm sure he will be a big discussion in the comments or next few days. I'm very heavily invested in Kessler this year. So yeah... </p>\n<p>Jordan Clarkson shot bad, but had 13pts, 4rebs, 6ast, 1stl. Nice. </p>\n<p>Talen Horton Tucker again for the 2nd game in a row shot around 30%, but he still gave us nice point guard 8ast, 3rebs, 3stl, 1 block! Still a nice game for him! </p>\n<p>Olynyck was great off bench 5-6 FG, 100% from the line, 4rebs, 3ast, 1stl, 1block. if he continues to get 27 minutes I would be interested in him longer term but I mostly view him as a streamer. </p>\n<p>Sexton chipped in 13pts, but little else. </p>\n<p>Nets vs Mavs </p>\n<p>Another win for the mavs with luka magic doing incredible things! It's pretty clear he willed them into victory, so freaking special. </p>\n<p>Let's talk nets first. </p>\n<p>Claxton was out and instead of DayRon Sharpe (like some thought including me) in the lineup we saw Dorian Finney Smith get the start. (sharpe only saw 3 mins, yikes) Cam Johnson was also out and this catapulted Cam Thomas in starting lineup. </p>\n<p>Dorrian Finney Smith had a nice game with 12pts, 4threes, 7rebs, 3ast. Don't chase this game tho. This was due to injuries thrust him in there and much larger mins (32) then he normally would get. </p>\n<p>Bridges isn't truly living up to his draft position with a bit of a struggle game here going 6-17 FG, (but 100% from line), 4rebs, 3ast. no defensive stats. Might be time to sell on him, cuz it's possible that this is the Cam Thomas show. </p>\n<p>Cam Thomas just wonderful. Whoa... NOW he deservers your attention! 30pts, on 12-19 FG, perfect 100% FTM, 7rebs, 2ast, 1stl, 1blck. We have said he mostly scores, but he brought some EXTRA here today! Woo hoo! Wowza. He is a must add in 12 teams. For the very least of \"trade bait\". He had 45 percent usage in last game and again this is very high usage in this game! He could be the best add of the season! Upside for top 75 maybe even top 50 production (if tons of points). Gotta be rostered tho, just has to be. </p>\n<p>Dinwiddie had a great game here 23pts on 8-17FG, 6threes, 3rebs, 8ast. That will do! That's around a 3rd-4th round type production!! </p>\n<p>Ben Simmons again does exactly what he is known for! good shooting 5-8, 10pts, 10rebs, 8ast, 2stl, 2blocks. ATTA BOY! He has top 20-30 upside if he plays like THIS! (and we seen it in years past) </p>\n<p>Royce O'Neale huge mins off the bench (34) and put up a huge line of 11pts, 10rebs, 3threes, 3ast, 1stl. If IF IF he gets minutes like this it might continue, but considering the injuries I don't think it will continue, but bravo to him, don't overreact. </p>\n<p>For Dallas. </p>\n<p>Luka luka luka. Wow. 49pts, insane 16-25 FG (must be mostly layups just like last game?) (I have not yet watched the game or \"condensed game\". Also 8-10 FTM, 10rebs, 7ast. His usage might be SKY HIGH continually on this bad dalls supporting cast (other than kyrie)</p>\n<p>Kyrie Irving 17pts, 6-17FG, 100% FTM, 7rebs, 6ast. an ok game. </p>\n<p>Derrick Lively follows up his great first game with only 9pts but again super solid 100% shooting on 4 shots (probably dunks/lobs I reckon?). Disappointing only 2 rebs and 1 block. Only 17mins yet had zero fouls? Bit confusing? PLAY THE KID! If he doesn't get the mins it's clearly a downside for his value. I think you still hold him to wait and see cuz he still has upside IF IF IF he gets more playing time. </p>\n<p>Grant Williams only 5pts, 6rebs, not a must roster.</p>\n<p>Tim Hardaway Jr off bench with big mins (30) with his usual scoring 19pts but only 6-17 FG bit inefficient, but helped 100% FTM. If only he could be more like his father  who was elite elite in steals. I ponder why on earth didn't his dad teach him those theft skills? lol</p>\n<p>Dwight Powell appears poised again to be a FG% streamer this year as he hit 4-4, plus a steal. </p>\n<p>Josh Green is interesting as a defender. 3steals. He also had 28mins. </p>\n<p>Rockets vs Spurs. </p>\n<p>Overtime game so stats are a bit skewed/extra from that. Spurs eeked out the win despite shooting slightly less than rockets. </p>\n<p>Sengun is looking like a MINI JOKIC! 25pts, 14rebs, 7ast, 2stl, 1blck. This is the type of upside we all knew existed when you drafted him in the 5th round. He fit builds where you needed extra AST from the big man, but here he is doing EVERYTHING. Whoa. HOLD. Don't sell high. That new coach likely knows the potential he has. </p>\n<p>FVV 24pts, on 50% shooting, 8rebs, 12ast, monster game! (where was the Sochan defense?) </p>\n<p>Jalen Green 22pts on efficient 50% shooting?! (maybe he is improving?) 5rebs, 4ast to also help out more! I still don't buy it and would be possibly selling high on this game maybe? </p>\n<p>Dillon Brooks appears like he might be a draft day steal. 17pts, 2rebs, 2ast, 1stl and getting massive 39 mins. </p>\n<p>Jabari Smith Jr 13pts (but terrible 5-16), 9rebs, 1stl. </p>\n<p>Amen Thompson only 13 mins, but i suppose did have 3ast. </p>\n<p>For Spurs </p>\n<p>Wemby A concern I had preseason was how would his FG% come out and here he struggled kinda 7-19 (missed all six threes), but real strong 7-8 from the line. 21pts, 12rebs, 1ast, 2stl, 3blocks. Those defensive stats and overall line are just MARVELOUS! But I would caution his 4 turnovers. Still, overall amazing game! HOLD. HOLD. Far too much upside. But I guess you could entertain offers because his value just SKYROCKETED and someone might give you a first rounder for him.. for real! </p>\n<p>Devin Vassell continues to break out 25pts, 3rebs, 2ast. </p>\n<p>Keldon Johnson is doing more than just scoring. 4ast, 4rebs, 20pts and very efficient 8-14. On this offense he is quite clearly the 2nd or 3rd option. Gotta hold him and see how far he can improve? </p>\n<p>Jeremy Sochan as the point guard is working fine (considering SA won), nice game 14pts, 5rebs, 4ast, 2stl and 100% FTM (he has appeared to fix that part of his game?). Must roster! </p>\n<p>Zach Collins alarming huge game despite struggling with shot, 9pts, 6rebs, 8ast, 4stl. </p>\n<p>Cedi Osman deep league relevant 14pts on good shooting. </p>\n<p>Tre Jones huge 33mins 6pts, 6rebs, 8ast, 3steals, beautiful. HOLD HOLD HOLD. Exactly the type of thing you expected from his skill set. </p>\n<p>Branham might be an AST streamer as he got 9pts, 4ast here. </p>\n<p>Raptors vs Bulls</p>\n<p>Chicago squeaks out the win in overtime! I'm a bit shocked raptors even got to overtime considering they only shot 37%! Yikes! </p>\n<p>Scottie Barnes with the Triple Double! 22pts, 10rebs, 10ast, 2blocks. I selected him in the 2nd round the other day! LOVE THIS! I see no reason why this can't continue! Clearly his value skyrocketing right now. (7 blocks on the season from the SF spot? ELITE) </p>\n<p>Siakam 18pts, 8rebs, 2ast. You would like more ast, but good game. </p>\n<p>OG Anunoby 11pts, 3rebs, 2steals. No need to panic. </p>\n<p>Dennis Schroder 10pts, 2rebs, 10ast, only 2 turnovers. He is looking like he will get a whole lot of AST on this team! He did struggle shooting tho 3-11. </p>\n<p>Poeltl likely fouled out early thus only 19min and 8pts, 6rebs. bit of a worry. </p>\n<p>Precious Achiuwa again wtih a big rebs game with 9 here, but as is the case with him bad FG% (40%). Still could be useful rebs streamer for those who need it this weekend. </p>\n<p>Gary Trent Jr did exactly what you want from him. 16pts, 3threes, 5rebs, 2stl, plus 1ast. Huge 36 mins too... </p>\n<p>Chris Boucher helpful 10pts, 6rebs worth monitoring. </p>\n<p>For Bulls: </p>\n<p>Demar DeRozan just does what he does, score from midrange! (one of the best in game at it). 11-22 FG, 33pts, 4rebs, 3ast, and a rare 4steals, 1block! BALLING OUT! Bit worrisome 71% from the line tho which is not usual for him. For as high as his usage he only had 2 turnovers. THAT MATTERS. Lavine got hurt in this game so DeRozan could absolutely skyrocket higher (well more pts mostly) IF Lavine has to miss time. Probably helps White and Vucevic some too. </p>\n<p>Vucevic only shot 4-15 FG? ouch. For a big man? Bigger ouch. He still got 12rebs, 11pts, 1blck, 1ast so it isn't unbearable. </p>\n<p>Lavine just couldn't put the ball in the hole. 3-14 FG!? 8pts, 5rebs, 1ast, 1block for him. His value is so low right and then you add the injury? Yikes. Still be patient... unless someone blows you away with an offer? (Maybe put him on trade block and see who offers what) </p>\n<p>Coby White now this was real nice to see from him! (He is still available in some leagues). 17pts, 6rebs, 8ast, 1stl, 100% from line, but only 33% shooting which is to be expected from him. If you need AST or FT% you should look his direction. Very good long term add as well. </p>\n<p>Alex Caruso, HOW YA DOING BOY?!? He is on of my darlings... 13pts, 13rebs, 2ast, 2stl, 1block. You expect the defense, you really don't expect that kind of elite rebounding, but it is an interesting development in his game if this continues further with big rebounds. Don't expect it or overreact to it, however the 32 minutes  ARE interesting. It would seem he stepped in for those Lavine minutes. IF lavine is out longer Caruso could benefit, but again temper those expectations, mostly its defense with him. </p>\n<p>Torrey Craig slightly relevant for SF mid level rebs stream as he got 5 here plus a steal and a block. </p>\n<p>Thunder vs Cavs </p>\n<p>well well it appears OKC is absolutely legit! (not a huge shock) As they pick up a big win against favorite Cavs (however they didn't have Allen or Garland). Most common reason most teams win is they shoot better than opponent, and that's what happened here. </p>\n<p>Shai continues to prove first round value. 34pts on bonkers 15-26 FG (not bonkers considering he is a mid range master) 11rebs, 4ast, 5stl, 1block. Contributing all over the stat sheet. Just nutty! Hold and hold on tightly. He will be part of championship teams no doubt. </p>\n<p>Chet Holmgren. 16pts, 3threes, 13rebs, 2ast, 1stl, 7blocks. SEVEN. Wow. Also only 1 turnover (as if he needed an even better stat line) If you can flip kessler for holmgren I might do that right now. One is surging on a great team and one is struggling on a bad team. This is the kind of wild upside he has! </p>\n<p>Lou Dort somehow popped in 25pts on 9-13 FG. He gets hot like this from time to time. He could be a guy you add and sell high? He also gave 3threes, 6rebs, 2ast, 1stl, 1blck. </p>\n<p>Josh Giddey really struggled immensely shooting 1-8 for only 2pts, and also 3 turnovers, but still helped out with 6rebs, 6ast to salvage terrible game. Don't panic just yet, probably just an off game.  </p>\n<p>For Cavs </p>\n<p>Donavon Mitchell went nuts in usage and excellence! 43pts on over 50% shooting, 81% from the line, 4threes, 8rebs, 5ast, 3stl, 2blcks. HOLD. He could return first round value for as long as players are injured on this team and even after. </p>\n<p>Evan Mobley nice to see a huge game from him! 14pts, 15rebs, 3ast, 2blocks, but did shoot only 40%. With the injuries this should continue. </p>\n<p>Okoro continues to produce in 2 games now 10pts, 7rebs, 2ast, 2stl, 1block. He is more known for his defense, but this is interesting to monitor. </p>\n<p>Strus absolutely struggled with shot. 3-14 FG, but still helped out with 5rebs, 4ast, 2stl, 1block. You might still be able to sell high based on that 1st game? </p>\n<p>Levert is the clear 6th man and should be relevant all season mostly for PTS or AST, he only had 2ast here, but 17pts, 2rebs, 1stl, 1blck. </p>\n<p>Heat vs Celtics </p>\n<p>Celtics are just so incredibly good folks as they pickup their 2nd win. (their starters played huge minutes again) </p>\n<p>Bam Adebayo 27pts, 7rebs, 2ast, 1stl, 2blcks no worries. </p>\n<p>Tyler Herro 28pts on 50% shooting, 5threes, 6rebs, 6ast, 1stl. Herro continues to step forward as the main scoring threat and top playmaker on this team. </p>\n<p>Jimmy Butler struggles with this shot 3-11, but still hit 8-9 (88%) from the line as well as 5rebs, 3ast, 1stl, 1block. Don't panic. He is a star. </p>\n<p>Kevin Love 2 games in a row with big time rebs! 9 in this game, and 9pts, 2threes, 2ast, 1stl. I do think he is relevant for that stat, but monitor his mins as he only had 21 here. </p>\n<p>Kyle Lowry. I was just talking him up the other day. I know there is way too much negativity about him and some think he is washed. This game proves HE IS NOT. Very worthy 13pts on 5-7 FG, 3threes, 8rebs, 5ast, 1block and only 1 turnover. If you need ast this is a guy to add. He also had 32 mins... He is NOT washed. It's very possible he finishes around top 100-125, I would not be shocked if around top 75, but I think that's less likely. Buy him way low cuz his market value is miniscule (again so much negativity around him) </p>\n<p>Dru smith had 3threes and 3 steals and 3ast. useful. </p>\n<p>Duncan Robinson hit 3threes. (streamer for that) </p>\n<p>For Boston: </p>\n<p>Jayson Tatum his usual self 22pts, 8rebs, 5ast, 1stl. </p>\n<p>Kristaps another great game 17pts, 9rebs, 1ast, 3stl, 1block. </p>\n<p>Jrue Holiday rectifies bad first game with a near triple double! (I believe he will have many many great games ahead) 17pts, 10rebs, 7ast, 1block. If you can still buy low on Jrue I think that's the best play!! He will be a big part of this offense! It does appear celtics will paly their starters huge minutes. (2 games in we have seen that) </p>\n<p>Derrick White 28pts, 9-15 FG, 5threes, 6rebs, 3ast, 1stl, 3blocks. I don't know if he is a sell high or hold. I think I lean sell high, but on this offense he will still get good looks. </p>\n<p>Jaylen Brown 27pts, 50% shooting, 3threes, 6rebs, 1ast, 2stl but 4 turnovers. Great great game but the liability at FT% (2-4 here) and turnovers do pop up.  </p>\n<p>Al Horford got 25 bench minutes and helped 10rebs, 2ast, 1block. Inevitably people will add him. I guess he is fine at the end of your bench, but don't expect points (he had zero here) </p>\n<p>Knicks vs Hawks </p>\n<p>The knicks won this game because they hit 20threes in comparison to the 12 the hawks hit. Maybe the hawks aren't as good as we thought they are? </p>\n<p>Julius Randle just randled. 17pts, 12rebs, 9ast near triple double, but again in his fashion 40% FG and 75% from the line. (you gotta punt percentages when you have him). Also no defensive stats and 3 turnovers. Still a great game and real real nice in PTS leagues. </p>\n<p>Jalen Brunson what a game! 31pts, 8threes, over 50% FG, 3rebs, 5ast, 1 turnover. He got extremely hot. You can't reliably expect this kind of shooting, but hold and enjoy. </p>\n<p>RJ Barrett 26pts, 9-15 FG (ok, i see you), 3threes, 3rebs, 6ast, 1stl. I think you use this to sell high on him (esp in a category league). In PTS leagues just continue to deploy as normal. </p>\n<p>Mitchell Robinson HOW YA DOING MAN!! And this was MANLY!!! ELITE DEFENSE. 4steals, 4 blocks, 13rebs!! Only 7pts (in his typical form) but interestingly only shot 2-6 (rarity). Robinson is special for his defense. (I am pretty heavily invested in him this year too). You might be able to snag him if you convince someone \"he doesn't score enough pts\" as some managers don't see beyond that. </p>\n<p>Quickly still holding value with 11pts, 6rebs, 6ast, 1stl despite not shooting well. </p>\n<p>For Atlanta </p>\n<p>DeAndre Hunter went nuts with 27pts, 6rebs, 1ast, 1block. 8-8 from the line. Is he going to shoot 8-13 every game? No. So I see this as mostly an aberration. Do NOT chase it. It's interesting and worth monitoring. </p>\n<p>Trae Young still struggling with his shot 4-16. I believe you kinda need to punt FG% if you own him, (and turnovers as he had 6 here, OUCH), but still does other good thing like shooting 80% 8-10 FTM and 12ast and 3steals. He might be a bit of a buy low considering his FG%, but then again I\"m not really \"extremely high on him\" either considering his liabilities (unless you wish to transform your team into that punt build). </p>\n<p>Dejounte Murry bounced back here shooting close to 50% on 18pts, 7rebs, 6ast, 1stl, 1block. Let's hope that continues. He is pretty proven so I reckon it should. </p>\n<p>Clint Capela. Yet again we see elite rebs. 13 of them with 13pts, 2ast, 1block. There still exists significant negativity around him so you might be able to buy him low despite 2 great games from him. He is another guy I might target to trade away Kessler (maybe). There is nothing that should scare you away from Capela really. And Okongwu again was at 20 mins only. This is Capelas job through and through, HOWEVER I might add that hawks are 0-2 so maybe maybe they change things up? (those changes might come in other place tho?) Also if they continue to lose it might be reason to \"develop Okongwu\" and trade away Capela. I don't know... </p>\n<p>Jalen Johnson has to be rostered in most cases. 11pts, (5-8) 9rebs, 2ast, 1stl, 1block. There is some upside here and getting the minutes. Others have mentioned this while I have been a bit more \"wait and see\". Two games now we see him getting huge mins (30) and performing just fine (around top 50-75). If there is one downside to his game it is he isn't an elite/great three point shooter, but otherwise plenty of all around talent! </p>\n<p>Bogdanovic relevant 4threes, 16pts, 3ast, 1stl. </p>\n<p>Nuggets vs Grizzlies </p>\n<p>\"He who shoots better usually wins\" and boom Nuggets shot better. Not a shock the champions scooped up a win against depleted grizzlies and now they fall to 0-2. I must bring THIS up: What if grizzlies continue to lose too many games and then decide they just won't bring Ja Morant back as they purposefully tank? Hmmm... I'm just tossing it out there... It's also possible if they are that far back if lights a stronger fire under Ja Morant to play harder/better... So you can look at it both ways? </p>\n<p>Jokic didn't get a triple double. What a bum. You can drop him now. LOL. Nah just kidding, HOWEVER I will declare an incredibly terrible stat Jokic did have: NINE TURNOVERS. Nine. That likely loses you the category. Eek. Don't panic tho folks, if anything try to \"buy low\" on him if you can for someone who does freak out about that? (there is a case to be made that if you own Jokic you are punting turnovers anyway). If you are trying to win turnovers with Jokic you are doing it wrong. He had 22pts, 12rebs, 7ast, 1stl, 1blck. </p>\n<p>Jamal Murray still great, 22pts, 4threes, 100% FTM, 1rebs, 5ast, 1block. </p>\n<p>MPJ is showing us some big time rebs! He had 13 here, plus 9pts, 3ast. If you need rebs it seems he could be a target especially from the SF spot. </p>\n<p>KCP really bringing the defense this year! 5 steals and a block! struggled shooting at 30%, but yeah real nice. Hold and enjoy top 75ish value all season. </p>\n<p>Aaron Gordon still was efficient and good with 10pts, 2rebs, 3ast, 3stls, 1block. Based on his draft position I still think he is a buy low. </p>\n<p>The nuggets bench showed up this time... </p>\n<p>Reggie Jackson 16pts, (7-13), 2rebs, 6ast, 1block. I mostly see him as an AST or PTS streamer, not entirely a must roster, but he very well could be on certain teams. </p>\n<p>Peyton Watson out of position blocks from a guard where he got 3blocks, plus 9pts, 2threes, 3rebs, 1steal. If you need defense or this is a specific part of your build maybe give him a look, but I think this is a \"monitor\" situation first... </p>\n<p>For Grizzlies: </p>\n<p>Marcus Smart 20pts (7-13 FG), 100% FT, 2rebs, 5ast, 5steals. FIVE. As long as No Ja Morant his value will remain high. Nice to see him shoot so well as he typically doesn't. </p>\n<p>Jaren Jackson Jr 21pts (9-13FG), 9rebs, 2ast, 3blcks. The higher rebs and higher FG% are an interesting development if he can continue to do that.. </p>\n<p>Xavier Tillman 13pts, 8rebs, 2ast, 3stls, 2blocks. Your time to buy low is fading (well nonexistent). This dude now has 2 monster games! And I see zero signs that this will end. HOLD. HOLD. </p>\n<p>Desmond Bane 15pts on 4-17 is EEK. (don't panic). He still went 6-6 FTM and 3rebs, 3ast, 2stl. Should get back on track soon. I wonder if denver double teamed him? Opening up shots for Smart and JJJ? </p>\n<p>Zaire Williams only shot 30% but 5-5 FTM and 9rebs, 3ast (also 4 bad turnovers). I'm iffy if he should be added. I more so want to monitor but possibly he is streamworthy for those rebs? He did get 31 mins... </p>\n<p>Derrick Rose this time was the 6th man scorer this time 16pts, 4rebs, 3ast, 1stl. Interesting. </p>\n<p>Konchar with 30 big mins off bench, 2pts, 6rebs, 2ast, 1stl, 2blocks could be useful as a rebounder and blocks streamer from guard spot. </p>\n<p>Pistons vs Hornets </p>\n<p>Young exciting pistons get a win! The hornets just shot unbelievably bad hence the 12 points victory for DET. </p>\n<p>Jalen Duren 14pts, 17rebs, 3ast, 1stl, 2blocks. 7-8 FG!!! HUGE!!! It would be pretty hard to pry away Duren from anyone and if you do own him HOLD HOLD HOLD. Stud. Top 20-40 type talent right now. </p>\n<p>Cade Cunningham 12pts (4-13 FG), 2rebs, 6ast, 1stl, 5turnovers. Eek terrible game. But don't panic... </p>\n<p>Isiah Stewart 15pts, 7rebs, 1ast, 1block. pretty nice game. He will likely have many games similar to this one. </p>\n<p>Ausar Thompson 6pts, 13rebs, 6ast, 1block (shot 2-9). As you can see the huge upside he has for other stats while not being a major scorer. (fits specific punt builds) </p>\n<p>Alec Burks 24pts, 50% FG, 11-12 FTM, 4rebs, 2ast, 1stl, 1blck. Don't overreact and chase this game. Although he will be a pretty reliable bench scorer. You could use this to sell high tho? </p>\n<p>Jaden Ivey 18pts, 2rebs, 4ast, 1stl. An interesting 2nd year talent who should continue to get ast and a fair amount of points. </p>\n<p>Bagley III 14pts, 4rebs, 1ast. If you need points and a few rebs, mostly a streamer. </p>\n<p>For Hornets: </p>\n<p>Lamelo Ball almost a triple double 20pts, 9rebs, 9ast but didn't shoot great 4-17. (again often a punt FG% type when you own him). He was great from the line 10-12 and 2stl, 1blck. </p>\n<p>Mark Williams comes far far back down to earth (cuz of foul trouble) with only 2pts, 3rebs, 1ast. Don't panic. Should be just fine. If anything use this game to buy low. </p>\n<p>Terry Rozier 20pts, 3rebs, 1ast, 1stl. Only 1ast? Come on man, need more... but he still scored and he also 4-4 FTM. </p>\n<p>Gordon Hayward huge game 19pts, 9rebs, 4ast, 3stl. He is available in leagues still and I believe he should be rostered. He is the 2nd or 3rd scoring option on this team and does plenty extra stuff. </p>\n<p>PJ Washington pretty good 13pts, 3rebs, 3ast, 2stl, 1blck. </p>\n<p>Brandon Miller stepped in off bench and nice game 17pts, 6rebs, 2ast, 1stl, 1blck. If you need some pts and rebs from your SF he could be worth an add. I kind of want to wait n see tho? </p>\n<p>Nick Richards had 2 blocks and a steal. </p>\n<p>----</p>\n<p>Now if you want a condensed version just copy/paste into Chat GPT... It was too long and chat gpt skipped out on games... </p>\n<p>-----</p>\n<p>I'm aware that most of this is just the stats. But I think that's important because some/many fantasy managers lack a basic awareness of the facts/stats (especially for players we do not own) So it's good to remind ourselves of what those are! I tried to add a few extra things other than just the stats. I know it might be \"too wordy\"? Trying to get better at this without being too robotic/boring or tough to read... </p>\n<p>What are YOUR takeaways. Things you noticed when you watched the games or disagree with some of the things I have said? I don't want this to just be \"my takeaways\", I'd like for some of you to add on please!

That is how you lose leagues. Over the first 3-4 weeks of the season, you should not be making any drastic roster moves with your top guys. Any player can get off to a slow start. <strong>DO NOT PANIC</strong>. Anyone in the top 75 should be given time to revert back to normal. Do not fall victim to 'small sample size theater'.</p>\n<p>You should <strong>not be dropping any player</strong> who would be picked up immediately by someone else. You also should not be trading players that have a start slow. <strong>Selling Low is poor form</strong>. Here is what you should be looking for in the first two weeks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Exploit the Panic in Others</strong> - Others will panic; <strong>exploit them!</strong> Buy Low on their slow starts, grab their bad drops off of the waivers, trade the bottom half of your team for their top-half players. Fan the flames of panic and grab any asset you can. Having too many assets is never a problem.</li>\n<li><strong>Hit the Waivers HARD &amp; IMMEDIATELY</strong> - The end of your bench should always be expendable. Take a chance on hot players immediately. Pick them up during opening night games. <strong>Do not wait!</strong> You could be grabbing a top 50 player off waivers in the next 5 days. (Think Desmond Bane, Cam Johnson, Jalen Williams). At worst, you'll get a few good starts followed by some bad starts then drop that player for another hot hand. These are the moves that win leagues, don't hesitate to grab any hot hand off the waivers and replace your end-of-the-bench guys at will. <strong>Do not sit on your waiver priority, that is not important in most leagues!</strong> You should have a new player on your team by Fri. night.</li>\n<li><strong>Sell High, eventually...</strong> - Don't get too attached to hot starts from mid-tier, either. Certainly, there are going to be break-out players, and you have to do your best to evaluate if their hot starts are sustainable. (Are they young enough to make the leap? Are the mins real? Are they shooting way above their avgs? (high FG &amp; FT are not sustainable. Does the return of an injured player reduce their value?) There is always a trade that makes sense. 9 out of 10 times, an average player will revert to the mean. Take the time to evaluate your team. <strong>Wait</strong>. Give guys a few weeks of run under them, and then start to think of their value long-term. Trades are the path to a successful season.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/0BPh0NmKDlmpcwgDMAMKKJ?si=mgakccajRVeNocb9jrGZVw\">Check out the Watching the Boxes Podcast</a> for your week-to-week analysis, check out the new <a href=\"https://www.industrypickup.com/\">Industry Pickup League</a> or follow the WTB <a href=\"https://twitch.tv/watchingtheboxes\">Twitch Channel.</a>  Thanks for reading and welcome back!</p>",

It might not make any difference whatsoever if teams are ready to sit their players out to load manage for the playoffs (and obviously it wouldn't change players getting injured and being unable to play).</p>\n<p><strong>But</strong> I think we're actually underrating the effect it may have on this fantasy/award season and that it's something to watch out for</p>\n<p>Last season, out of the 15 players who made the All-NBA teams, 5 of them (33%) did not meet the 65 games qualifier:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Giannis (63g, only unanimous 1st team selection)</li>\n<li>Steph (56g, 2nd team)</li>\n<li>Jimmy Buckets (64g, 2nd team)</li>\n<li>Dame (58g, 3rd team)</li>\n<li>Bron (55g, 3rd team)</li>\n<li>Honorable mention: AD was at 56 games and just missed out, with people calling out his lack of availability</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On the defensive side, we had JJJ and Giannis who both played 63 games.</p>\n<p>In the 2021-22 season, we had players such as Ja, KD, Steph, Bron, Bam, RobWill, Dray make the All-NBA or All-Defense teams while missing the 65 game limit.</p>\n<p>What I think is that this new rule will indeed make a difference for multiple players this year. </p>\n<p>You can never account for injury, but I'm 99.9% sure that LeBron will play 65 games this season (maybe even exactly 65) if he has no major injury in order to make sure he makes the All-NBA team (and/or MVP conversation or whatever else he's a part of). Giannis, Jimmy would obviously have played 1-2 more games last year to guarantee their accolades. AD and Steph might have played a few more instead of resting as long as it's not sitting due to a real injury.</p>\n<p>I don't think someone like Kawhi would care enough where the Clips load manage him less just so he can qualify, but shit if Zion is nearing 60 somehow then he'll keep going to make sure he lands a spot on All-NBA. And I'm like sure sure on the LeBron thing.</p>\n<p>What do you guys think? Does this rule change anything at all for any players, or is it insignificant? And if it'll make a difference, who are some players to keep in mind?</p>",

Man was an absolute beast last season and he didn't really hurt you anywhere. His FT was a bit low for a guard but certainly won't kill you.

Or are you just looking for a new way to play?</p>\n<p>Introducing The \"Tony Snell Cardio League,\" named after the man who famously played 28 minutes in an NBA game without any points, rebounds, assists, steals or blocks. </p>\n<p>It's a new format where you compete to find the players who get the most minutes without doing good stuff. </p>\n<p>Five things get you +1: minutes, fg missed, ft missed, 3p missed, turnovers. </p>\n<p>Five things get you -1: points, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks. </p>\n<p>Also +10 for ejections because it's a fun lil wild card.</p>\n<p>Based on this point system, we can see the following players that ESPN projects as the top 10 per game for this year:</p>\n<p>Player | AVG\n:-- | :--: \nReggie Bullock | 24.9\nRoyce O'Neal | 24.5\nAnfernee Simons | 23.4\nJalen Green | 22.8\nDorian Finney-Smith | 22.7\nJordan Clarkson | 22.3\nO.G. Anunoby | 22.0\nMalik Beasley | 21.9\nKevin Huerter | 21.8\nDe'Andre Hunter | 21.5 </p>\n<p>What we can see already is that there seems to be two strats: you can do the Dorian Finney-Smith 3&amp;D all minutes no shots build, or you can do the Dillon Brooks collect misses build. And then there's an inherent challenge of finding players who are good enough to get minutes, but bad enough to be bad with those minutes. </p>\n<p>I and some friends are doing this league on ESPN with a draft on Oct. 22 2 p.m. EST so DM me if you want to join and I'll send more details and a link for this <a href=\"https://fantasy.espn.com/basketball/tools/leaguemembers?leagueId=776514146&amp;seasonId=2024\">free points auction H2H league.</a> Or you can set it up yourself and find the next Tony Snell yourself.</p>",

Thrust into a starting spot alongside PG/Kawhi, Roco delivered a vintage performance \u2014 11 points, 2 steals and 4 blocks in 22 minutes. Ty Lue is a blobfish and had Marcus Morris practicing with the first unit the very next day though. Still, Covington is worth grabbing late as he has top 80 upside in just 20 minutes of play.</li>\n<li><strong>Jalen Johnson</strong> has been awesome, displaying his G league stat-stuffing ways in the preseason. Will ATL give the youngster a chance to prove himself over their F rotation of mediocrity (De'Andre Hunter/Saddiq Bey)?</li>\n<li>Jaden McDaniels (MIN) has a left calf strain that is expected to sideline him for a couple of weeks. <strong>Kyle Anderson</strong> (quietly 85th in CAT leagues last year filling in for KAT's missed time) could provide streaming value in the early going.</li>\n<li><strong>Coby White</strong> has the edge thus far over CHI's plethora of mediocre guards (Ayo Dosunmu, Jevon Carter, Alex Caruso) to be the 5th starter. Could be worth a last round flier if needing cheap 3s/assists.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>14+ Team Leagues:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The injury bug has hit the Pelicans again, with Trey Murphy, Naji Marshall, Nance Jr., Alvarado and now even Herb Jones picking up a (hopefully minor) neck issue. <strong>Dyson Daniels</strong> could be an intriguing player who can be a serviceable source of steals/assists in the early going.</li>\n<li>Memphis' fifth starter during Ja Morant's suspension is still up in the air. Ideally a guard would step in but Luke Kennard has underwhelmed and Derrick Rose probably shouldn't be put in that position at this stage in his career. <strong>Santi Aldama</strong>, <strong>Ziaire Williams</strong> and David Roddy have all had moments in the preseason. An unresolved situation to monitor. I would especially keep an eye on Santi and Ziaire.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Dynasty/Deep Leagues:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Payton Pritchard</strong> (on an absolute tear since signing the extension. Will be hard to find shots/minutes with Jrue coming in but he's absolutely a quality NBA player)</li>\n<li><strong>Jordan Goodwin</strong> (poised debut in preseason, definitely can provide PHX with backup guard minutes)</li>\n<li><strong>JT Thor</strong> (has impressed teammates in camp, could fill in some Miles Bridges minutes)</li>\n<li><strong>Julian Strawther</strong> (DEN drafted NBA ready rookies to fill immediate roles. Strawther has impressed with his 3 point shooting, averaging 18PPG over the last two on 53% from 3)</li>\n<li><strong>Toumani Camara</strong> (has looked like a first round talent who slid too far in the early going. His increased range from 3 looks real and unlocks future upside)</li>\n<li><strong>Jamal Cain</strong> (lost in the Wemby game was Cain's impressive showing.

Who does he go to? Almost always the top team or two in draft by ELO. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ben Simmons has WILD range. I saw a guy draft him at 85 in a $250 buy in. I got him myself at 115th in a $250 buy in. That might be the craziest swing you see. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Wemby jumped to a almost 2nd rounder after his last preseason game: there will be no cheap Wemby experience. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Embiid is slipping out of that consensus 2 slot, he fell as far as 6th in one draft</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Ask me anything about my 7 drafts so far and I will answer</p>\n<p>Also please check out Fantasy Trash Talk on YouTube for full drafts, guides and recaps </p>\n<p>-Josh</p>",

Here is this year's punt blocks guide. I hope that it will help with your drafts. It's a nice option for teams starting with Hali, Curry, Tatum, Kyrie, and most of the guards around the turn. It's obviously a good option for Jokic-led teams as well, although punt threes is usually the way to go with Big Honey. It's a nice option in both eight- and nine-category leagues. It tends to be a small-ball build, but unlike in punt FG%, you usually don't run into major issues with turnovers. It's a nice alternative for those who want to go with a small-ball team but don't want to battle four or so punt FG% teams for the same small set of bigs. </p>\n<p>Here are the guides:</p>\n<p>Yahoo: <a href=\"https://elitefantasybasketball.com/23-24-punt-blocks-yahoo/\">https://elitefantasybasketball.com/23-24-punt-blocks-yahoo/</a></p>\n<p>ESPN: <a href=\"https://elitefantasybasketball.com/23-24-punt-blocks-espn/\">https://elitefantasybasketball.com/23-24-punt-blocks-espn/</a></p>\n<p>Guides for punt assists, punt FG%, punt FT%, punt threes, punt points, and punt steals are also available and so are pairing guides for the first two and five rounds. Projections and various Top 150s are available as well.

I watch the Bulls and feel like I got a few little tidbits of info.  No one has time to watch every teams entire media presser so I thought it would be cool for people to just post their own. \n\nBulls notes:\n\n**Billy Donovan and AK:**\n\n* AK has been emphasizing changing shot profile since the last season ended and has consistently mentioned it during the presser.  Bulls were among the last in 3PA so safe to assume they\u2019ll try to get more volume from somewhere.  Also mentioned increasing pace.\n\n* More interestingly Billy and AK indicated that they can\u2019t just launch shots.  They talked about changing how the offense is run.  Moving away from Demar and Lavine ISOs.  Meshes with what Vucevic says later in the presser about using him more as an offensive hub.\n\n* Billy said emphasis is to get the ball in the paint more to get more offensive rebounds and spray out 3s. \n\n* PG and PF positions are not set in stone and will be determined in training camp this week.  They are also willing to change it around mid season if they feel like other looks are working better.\n\n**Zach Lavine:**\n\n* Not much here aside from him being fully healthy and actually had an off season to train instead of rehab.  He expects to shoot more 3s.  He seems slightly annoyed about the trade rumors if you\u2019re the type of person who thinks that\u2019ll motivate him.\n\n**Demar Derozan:**\n\n* Demar actually indicated he needs to shoot more 3s and that he knows how it\u2019ll help his game.  This is kind of a big deal imo, I\u2019ve watched all his interviews and this is the first time he\u2019s actually admitted he has to adjust.  He usually defers and says he\u2019ll take 3s when they\u2019re given to him or within the flow, and he said some of that here, but I haven\u2019t heard him say that he needs to shoot more like this this plainly since he was traded here.\n\n* Made an offhand joke about joining the point guard battle.  Probably nothing, but maybe he was asked to facilitate more?\n\n**Nikola Vucevic:**\n\n* IMO the real juicy take away from the day.  Vucevic indicated part of him resigning was getting more touches in the paint.  Said Billy talked to him about utilizing him more as a hub for the offense and taking advantage of his playmaking. Denver and Jokic mentioned as a team among others that can look to for examples. Talked about having more actions with guards cutting to him.\n\n**Jevon Carter**\n\n* Not much, but talked about how Bulls seemed hesitant to shoot last year.  Excited and motivated to play for his home town.\n\n* Mentioned he feels like Bulls need a floor general to take pressure off Lavine and Demar. \n\n**Coby White**\n\n* Same as Jevon really.  Excited for the positional battle.\n\n* Said he continued this off season where he left off last year with working on his handles, finishing, becoming more of a complete player.\n\n* Said he wants to return a bit to his mindset as \u201chighschool coby.\u201d idk if that means he\u2019s embracing the scorer role as 6th man, but maybe something to keep in mind of you\u2019re deciding between him and carter late in the draft. \n\n**TLDR:** \nBulls as a whole are trying to increase pace, 3s, and fouls.  They are probably going to try to use Vucevic more as a passer. Demar will continue to try to shoot more 3s. Lavine is healthy. PG and PF positions are up in the air.<div><br></div><div><p>I know media day is mostly fluff, but you can gain some insight into how teams are looking to approach the season or where they are leaning towards in positional battles.

For these numbers, **I only go by the top 180 Fantasy players for each season**.\n\n**How many players averaged 2 steals per game, or more** **in the 2022-2023 season?**\n\n22: 0  \n21: 1  \n20: 1  \n19: 2  \n18: 3  \n17: 6  \n16: 3  \n15: 6  \n14: 4  \n13: 3  \n12: 4  \n11: 3  \n10: 3  \n09: 3  \n08: 2  \n07: 6  \n06: 7  \n05: 5  \n04: 5  \n03: 4  \n02: 6  \n01: 4  \n00: 7  \n99: 7  \n98: 13  \n97: 8  \n96: 9  \n95: 8  \n94: 7  \n93: 9  \n92: 10  \n91: 12  \n90: 15  \n89: 14  \n88: 15  \n87: 13\n\nAs you can see, 22-23 was the first season in modern day NBA where not a single player averaged two steals or more per game. And we could\u2019ve seen it coming, as we only had two players (Butler and Dejounte) topping that number over the past two seasons. Looking at **averages**, steals have been clearly trending down, as well:\n\n2022 \u2013 2023 OG Anunoby at 1.90  \n2021 \u2013 2022 Dejounte Murray at 2.00  \n2020 \u2013 2021 Jimmy Butler at 2.10  \n2019 \u2013 2020 Ben Simmons at 2.00  \n2018 \u2013 2019 Paul George at 2.20  \n2017 \u2013 2018 Victor Oladipo at 2.36  \n2016 \u2013 2017 Draymond Green at 2.03  \n2015 \u2013 2016 Stephen Curry at 2.14  \n2014 \u2013 2015 Kawhi Leonard at 2.31  \n2013 \u2013 2014 Chris Paul at 2.48  \n2012 \u2013 2013 Chris Paul at 2.41  \n2011 \u2013 2012 Chris Paul at 2.53  \n2010 \u2013 2011 Chris Paul at 2.35  \n2009 \u2013 2010 Rajon Rondo at 2.33  \n2008 \u2013 2009 Chris Paul at 2.77  \n2007 \u2013 2008 Chris Paul at 2.71  \n2006 \u2013 2007 Baron Davis at 2.14  \n2005 \u2013 2006 Gerald Wallace at 2.51  \n2004 \u2013 2005 Larry Hughes at 2.89  \n2003 \u2013 2004 Baron Davis at 2.36  \n2002 \u2013 2003 Allen Iverson at 2.74  \n2001 \u2013 2002 Allen Iverson at 2.8  \n2000 \u2013 2001 Allen Iverson at 2.51  \n1999 \u2013 2000 Eddie Jones at 2.67  \n1998 \u2013 1999 Kendall Gill at 2.68  \n1997 \u2013 1998 Mookie Blaylock at 2.61  \n1996 \u2013 1997 Mookie Blaylock at 2.72  \n1995 \u2013 1996 Gary Payton at 2.85  \n1994 \u2013 1995 Scottie Pippen at 2.94  \n1993 \u2013 1994 Nate McMillan at 2.96  \n1992 \u2013 1993 Michael Jordan at 2.83  \n1991 \u2013 1992 John Stockton at 2.98  \n1990 \u2013 1991 Alvin Robertson 3.04  \n1989 \u2013 1990 Michael Jordan at 2.77  \n1988 \u2013 1989 John Stockton 3.21  \n1987 \u2013 1988 Michael Jordan 3.16\n\n**What\u2019s the average amount of steals these top 180 players got for each season?**\n\n2022 \u2013 2023: 0.91414065  \n2021 \u2013 2022: 0.93410100  \n2020 \u2013 2021: 0.93027035  \n2019 \u2013 2020: 0.94299695  \n2018 \u2013 2019: 0.94633821  \n2017 \u2013 2018: 1.02901983  \n2016 \u2013 2017: 1.01595659  \n2015 \u2013 2016: 1.05094439  \n2014 \u2013 2015: 1.00882484  \n2013 \u2013 2014: 1.02068121  \n2012 \u2013 2013: 1.05136976  \n2011 \u2013 2012: 1.01746295  \n2010 \u2013 2011: 0.98020540  \n2009 \u2013 2010: 0.99888955  \n2008 \u2013 2009: 1.01569093  \n2007 \u2013 2008: 1.01325937  \n2006 \u2013 2007: 1.01503578  \n2005 \u2013 2006: 0.99135125  \n2004 \u2013 2005: 1.04485752  \n2003 \u2013 2004: 1.07774316\n\nWhere it was hovering around 1 steal per game for years, it\u2019s now clearly in danger of dipping below 0.9 steals per game, which means guys getting close to 2 steals per game are becoming more and more valuable.\n\n**Your league leaders for steals (all avg over 1.5 spg):**\n\n1. Anunoby \u2013 1.9\n2. Delon Wright 1.8  \nJimmy Butler \u2013 1.8  \nFVV \u2013 1.8\n3. SGA \u2013 1.7\n4.

Chris Paul \u2013 1.5  \nSmart \u2013 1.5  \nDejounte Murray \u2013 1.5  \nCaruso \u2013 1.5  \nPaul George \u2013 1.5  \nKCP \u2013 1.5  \nDonovan Mitchell \u2013 1.5  \nFultz \u2013 1.5\n2.

For reference, 10 years ago, in the 2012-2013 season, there were 21 players who averaged 1.5 steals per game, or more.\n\nLet\u2019s zoom in on some of the names listed here:\n\n**OG** *\u2013* Always averaging around 1.5 spg, with a bump last year. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see it come down a bit more, towards 1.5 spg again.  \n**Delon** \u2013 Bit up and down, obviously heavily related to his minutes increase/decrease. Charlotte likes him as a back up PG, so situation probably wouldn\u2019t change too much for him. I see him getting around 24 mpg again, which means he could end up top 3 in spg again. What I don\u2019t like is that his role always seems to be somewhat up in the air. Just needs \\~24 mpg to make a dent in spg, but doesn\u2019t help out much elsewhere.  \n**Butler** \u2013 The safest play you could make for steals, however his games played per season hovers around 60, so that means he\u2019s probably gonna max out at 120 steals for the season: still good.  \n**FVV** \u2013 Now in Houston. Probably will split some minutes with KPjr and Thompson. FVV likes to gamble playing the passing lanes. Every season since 19-20 he\u2019s almost reached 2 spg. I don\u2019t think he dips too much, but who knows: Nurse\u2019s system really pushed for players to put unrelenting pressure on ball handlers.  \n**SGA** \u2013 Keeps trending up. I would not be surprised to see him lead the league in steals next year. Even though the usage might decrease a bit, he still is a good bet to give Jokic some competition as the best overall fantasy performer next year.  \n**Melton** \u2013 Sixers guaranteed his contract, and with Harden\u2019s status up in the air, it\u2019s hard to predict what will happen. He\u2019s now coached by Nick Nurse now, so that should at least keep your eyes on Melton as a possible league leader in steals. Also posted a single game-high (along with D\u2019Angelo Russell) of 7 steals last season.  \n**Haliburton** \u2013 While not a great defender, I can see his steals sustain, or rise, as the rest of the team matures.  \n**Ant Edwards** \u2013 stock will be soaring in drafts, and I feel his hype might be overblown a bit. Incredibly interesting upside, though. Do I see a lot of upside here for steals, beyond what he\u2019s shown? I doubt it.  \n**Trent** \u2013 Not buying this stock. Nurse is gone, and I\u2019m not even sure if Trent\u2019s role is secure. Might even get dealt. I\u2019m looking elsewhere for steals.  \n**Herb Jones** \u2013 I think he is what he is. And that\u2019s usueful. However, what if the Pelicans have Zion more available this season? Do you continue to play him with Herb, or do you opt to surround Zion with better shooters, like Trey, most of the time?  \n**Dejounte Murray** \u2013 Probably more of the same \u2013 led the league in steals during his last season with the Spurs, but now gambles a bit less and has to cover for Trae a bit more. 1.5-1.6 is what I expect from him, as is the case with Smart, Paul, George, and Mitchell. Kawhi could increase his averages from a career-low 1.4 per game, but I just don\u2019t trust him enough to play sufficient games.  \nI won\u2019t be buying any KPjr, Hayes, Oubre or Fultz stock for steals this year, as they either won\u2019t play enough or will have tough competition for their roles (Fultz). Doncic\u2019 steals dipped post AS game, which also was when Kyrie played most of his games. I don\u2019t trust Doncic to sustain the 1.4 spg he posted last season, and expect him to average closer to a single steal a game.  \n**Jalen Williams** is a dark horse to make it to the top three in steals this season. Hovered right around 1.7-2.0 steals per game post-all-star, and that team continues to improve, with Holmgren now manning the paint.\n\n**Some under the radar names to keep an eye on, in rostered % tiers:**\n\n**50%+ rostered**  \n**Immanuel Quickley** \u2013 Such a fun player, and I think he\u2019s only going to continue to improve. Plays both ends of the floor really well, and I\u2019d just love to see him and Grimes in the back court together. I feel like Quickley is one of the more underrated guards in the league. 61% rostered.  \n**Tre and Tyus Jones** \u2013 Both in somewhat similar situations in San Antonio and Washington. I don\u2019t trust either of them long term, but time and time again, they\u2019ve also shown to be incredibly useful back up point guards. Both should get enough minutes to produce in assists and steals (at least 1.2 per game), while not ruining your TO (Tyus sitting at 5.2:0.9).  \n**Zach Collins** \u2013 Where many believed Wemby would push Zach to the bench, it sounds like they\u2019re going to start together. Zach Collins is a sneaky play for steals at the C position, as he averaged over a steal per game post AS break last season. Rostered in 62% of Yahoo\u2019s leagues, he\u2019ll be hard to obtain.\n\n**25-50% rostered**  \n**Kentavious Caldwell-Pope** \u2013 Only rostered in 50% of Yahoo\u2019s leagues now. Granted, he\u2019s a specialist, but getting 1.8 threes and 1.5 spg at his price, could be a bargain. Secure role with the Nuggets, and doesn\u2019t dent your team anywhere, really.  \n**Paul Reed** \u2013 Keeping a firm eye on Reed and the Sixers\u2019 situation. With the Celtics and Bucks improving their teams a lot, and the Sixers (and Heat) sitting on their thumbs, mostly, I could see Morey wanting to start with a clean sheet soonish. Reed is locked up on a quite friendly contract and has huge upside. I know there were videos of him shooting the three off the dribble, but the shot still looked bad. Otherwise, Reed can do it all. Including racking up steals. As a center, which makes them even more valuable. Just a lot of risk involved, as his role is up in the air right now. Rostered in 33% of Yahoo\u2019s leagues, Reed does almost always produce when getting the minutes (14 steals, 22 blocks in 8 games in which he got 20+ minutes).  \n**Tari Eason** \u2013 Rostered in 46% of Yahoo\u2019s leagues, most people can\u2019t wait until Eason breaks out. Already averaging 1.2 spg in just 21 mpg, his upside is incredible for fantasy managers. I really want to see Eason (and Smith) run with a point guard, instead of whatever KPjr thought he was doing. Eason averaged almost two steals in 5 games as a starter, and he could find himself in the top three next season.  \n**Amen and Amir Thompson** \u2013 While they\u2019re quite different as players, I believe both will be among the league leaders in steals from the get-go. They\u2019re very strong and have both quick hands and feet. Minutes are available for both, as well.\n\n**0-25% rostered**  \n**Matisse Thybulle** \u2013 Could walk into a starting SF role with the Blazers, and averaged close to 1.7 steals per game over his last 20 games last season (27.6 mp).  \n**Delon Wright** \u2013 As mentioned above, status is up in the air, and with him, it\u2019s really only about steals. But he racks them up. Only rostered in 8% of Yahoo\u2019s leagues.  \n**Donte DiVincenzo** \u2013 Numbers don\u2019t jump off the page, but he\u2019s useful (1.3 spg). Knicks have some interesting positional battles, which brings me to\u2026  \n**Quentin Grimes** \u2013 One of my favorite break out players for next season. I\u2019m incredibly sure he\u2019s going to put it all together. His defense hasn\u2019t translated to great steals numbers as of yet, but I\u2019m willing to bet money that he\u2019s gonna be a hot target soon. Propping up Quickley and Grimes makes me sound like a Knicks fan. Which I\u2019m definitely not. Only rostered in 20% of Yahoo\u2019s leagues.  \n**Josh Green** \u2013 Dallas has horrible depth, and horrible defense. Josh Green should see a lot more minutes this season, and he\u2019s a good defender. As with Grimes, the defense hasn\u2019t translated to great steals numbers as of yet, but he could get there soon. Rostered in 7% of Yahoo\u2019s leagues.  \n**Jaden Springer** \u2013 Only rostered in 1% of Yahoo\u2019s league for a reason. Still can\u2019t shoot, or score, really. But his defense is amazing. In the right built, he could be a fun player down the road (do the Sixers blow it up? And is Springer going to be part of any plans after that?), but right now the Sixers have a better, and more complete version of Springer in Melton.  \n**Anthony Black** \u2013 Only rostered in 10% of Yahoo\u2019s leagues, which is less than Suggs (13%), and I truely believe Black is going to kill it this season. Such a smart, strong and skilled player. I also think he\u2019ll be among the rookie leaders in steals per game. I\u2019m not too worried about Suggs, and I think he\u2019s also a better fit than Fultz.  \n**Kris Dunn** \u2013 Depending on how the Jazz back court shakes out (I believe Keyonte George will be starting before year\u2019s end), Dunn could win that starting PG position, as he did quite well for the Jazz later last season. If he does, he could be a top 5 player in steals per game. Interesting streamer, rostered in 8% of Yahoo\u2019s leagues.  \n**Cam Whitmore** \u2013 With KPjr being gone, minutes have just opened up for Whitmore, who could surprise a lot of people (rostered in 9%), as he can produce across the board if give minutes. Averaged 1.4 steals per game in college.  \n**Dyson Daniels** \u2013 Sometimes reminds me of Anthony Randolph, in the sense that he has so many tools and so much raw talent, yet he\u2019s also so incredibly\u2026 raw. A lot of the stuff he does seems to be relying on talent and instincts, but going back to the basics is hard for him. The Pelicans have quite a few options at guard, but I\u2019m interested to follow Daniels closely.  \n**Jaylin Williams** \u2013 I truely believe Chet Holmgren would play best, at least early on in his career, with Jaylin next to him. If Williams tops 24 mpg, he could be a useful source of steals at the C position. I think Jaylin Williams could develop into a player in the mold of an Al Horford (albeit the chance of reaching that same level is small).  \n**Alex Caruso** \u2013 Definitely belongs as a target for any team looking to add steals to its roster. Caruso will see enough minutes to be useful, and always comes through. With steals. Can you survive the lack of production in other cats?\n\n[**https://perkinsfor3.wordpress.com/2023/10/02/prince-among-thieves-securing-your-steals-2023-2024/**](https://perkinsfor3.wordpress.com/2023/10/02/prince-among-thieves-securing-your-steals-2023-2024/)<div><br></div><div><p>Man, blocks and steals are harder and harder to find, meaning you\u2019ll likely have to pay up a fair amount if you\u2019re looking to obtain them through trades or early on in drafts.</p>\n<p>As always, let\u2019s take a look at some numbers from the past, and see how they compare to the current day NBA.

For reference, 10 years ago, in the 2012-2013 season, there were 21 players who averaged 1.5 steals per game, or more.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s zoom in on some of the names listed here:</p>\n<p><strong>OG</strong> <em>\u2013</em> Always averaging around 1.5 spg, with a bump last year. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see it come down a bit more, towards 1.5 spg again.<br />\n<strong>Delon</strong> \u2013 Bit up and down, obviously heavily related to his minutes increase/decrease. Charlotte likes him as a back up PG, so situation probably wouldn\u2019t change too much for him. I see him getting around 24 mpg again, which means he could end up top 3 in spg again. What I don\u2019t like is that his role always seems to be somewhat up in the air. Just needs \\~24 mpg to make a dent in spg, but doesn\u2019t help out much elsewhere.<br />\n<strong>Butler</strong> \u2013 The safest play you could make for steals, however his games played per season hovers around 60, so that means he\u2019s probably gonna max out at 120 steals for the season: still good.<br />\n<strong>FVV</strong> \u2013 Now in Houston. Probably will split some minutes with KPjr and Thompson. FVV likes to gamble playing the passing lanes. Every season since 19-20 he\u2019s almost reached 2 spg. I don\u2019t think he dips too much, but who knows: Nurse\u2019s system really pushed for players to put unrelenting pressure on ball handlers.<br />\n<strong>SGA</strong> \u2013 Keeps trending up. I would not be surprised to see him lead the league in steals next year. Even though the usage might decrease a bit, he still is a good bet to give Jokic some competition as the best overall fantasy performer next year.<br />\n<strong>Melton</strong> \u2013 Sixers guaranteed his contract, and with Harden\u2019s status up in the air, it\u2019s hard to predict what will happen. He\u2019s now coached by Nick Nurse now, so that should at least keep your eyes on Melton as a possible league leader in steals. Also posted a single game-high (along with D\u2019Angelo Russell) of 7 steals last season.<br />\n<strong>Haliburton</strong> \u2013 While not a great defender, I can see his steals sustain, or rise, as the rest of the team matures.<br />\n<strong>Ant Edwards</strong> \u2013 stock will be soaring in drafts, and I feel his hype might be overblown a bit. Incredibly interesting upside, though. Do I see a lot of upside here for steals, beyond what he\u2019s shown? I doubt it.<br />\n<strong>Trent</strong> \u2013 Not buying this stock. Nurse is gone, and I\u2019m not even sure if Trent\u2019s role is secure. Might even get dealt. I\u2019m looking elsewhere for steals.<br />\n<strong>Herb Jones</strong> \u2013 I think he is what he is. And that\u2019s usueful. However, what if the Pelicans have Zion more available this season? Do you continue to play him with Herb, or do you opt to surround Zion with better shooters, like Trey, most of the time?<br />\n<strong>Dejounte Murray</strong> \u2013 Probably more of the same \u2013 led the league in steals during his last season with the Spurs, but now gambles a bit less and has to cover for Trae a bit more. 1.5-1.6 is what I expect from him, as is the case with Smart, Paul, George, and Mitchell. Kawhi could increase his averages from a career-low 1.4 per game, but I just don\u2019t trust him enough to play sufficient games.<br />\nI won\u2019t be buying any KPjr, Hayes, Oubre or Fultz stock for steals this year, as they either won\u2019t play enough or will have tough competition for their roles (Fultz). Doncic\u2019 steals dipped post AS game, which also was when Kyrie played most of his games. I don\u2019t trust Doncic to sustain the 1.4 spg he posted last season, and expect him to average closer to a single steal a game.<br />\n<strong>Jalen Williams</strong> is a dark horse to make it to the top three in steals this season. Hovered right around 1.7-2.0 steals per game post-all-star, and that team continues to improve, with Holmgren now manning the paint.</p>\n<p><strong>Some under the radar names to keep an eye on, in rostered % tiers:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>50%+ rostered</strong><br />\n<strong>Immanuel Quickley</strong> \u2013 Such a fun player, and I think he\u2019s only going to continue to improve. Plays both ends of the floor really well, and I\u2019d just love to see him and Grimes in the back court together. I feel like Quickley is one of the more underrated guards in the league. 61% rostered.<br />\n<strong>Tre and Tyus Jones</strong> \u2013 Both in somewhat similar situations in San Antonio and Washington. I don\u2019t trust either of them long term, but time and time again, they\u2019ve also shown to be incredibly useful back up point guards. Both should get enough minutes to produce in assists and steals (at least 1.2 per game), while not ruining your TO (Tyus sitting at 5.2:0.9).<br />\n<strong>Zach Collins</strong> \u2013 Where many believed Wemby would push Zach to the bench, it sounds like they\u2019re going to start together. Zach Collins is a sneaky play for steals at the C position, as he averaged over a steal per game post AS break last season. Rostered in 62% of Yahoo\u2019s leagues, he\u2019ll be hard to obtain.</p>\n<p><strong>25-50% rostered</strong><br />\n<strong>Kentavious Caldwell-Pope</strong> \u2013 Only rostered in 50% of Yahoo\u2019s leagues now. Granted, he\u2019s a specialist, but getting 1.8 threes and 1.5 spg at his price, could be a bargain. Secure role with the Nuggets, and doesn\u2019t dent your team anywhere, really.<br />\n<strong>Paul Reed</strong> \u2013 Keeping a firm eye on Reed and the Sixers\u2019 situation. With the Celtics and Bucks improving their teams a lot, and the Sixers (and Heat) sitting on their thumbs, mostly, I could see Morey wanting to start with a clean sheet soonish. Reed is locked up on a quite friendly contract and has huge upside. I know there were videos of him shooting the three off the dribble, but the shot still looked bad. Otherwise, Reed can do it all. Including racking up steals. As a center, which makes them even more valuable. Just a lot of risk involved, as his role is up in the air right now. Rostered in 33% of Yahoo\u2019s leagues, Reed does almost always produce when getting the minutes (14 steals, 22 blocks in 8 games in which he got 20+ minutes).<br />\n<strong>Tari Eason</strong> \u2013 Rostered in 46% of Yahoo\u2019s leagues, most people can\u2019t wait until Eason breaks out. Already averaging 1.2 spg in just 21 mpg, his upside is incredible for fantasy managers. I really want to see Eason (and Smith) run with a point guard, instead of whatever KPjr thought he was doing. Eason averaged almost two steals in 5 games as a starter, and he could find himself in the top three next season.<br />\n<strong>Amen and Amir Thompson</strong> \u2013 While they\u2019re quite different as players, I believe both will be among the league leaders in steals from the get-go. They\u2019re very strong and have both quick hands and feet. Minutes are available for both, as well.</p>\n<p><strong>0-25% rostered</strong><br />\n<strong>Matisse Thybulle</strong> \u2013 Could walk into a starting SF role with the Blazers, and averaged close to 1.7 steals per game over his last 20 games last season (27.6 mp).<br />\n<strong>Delon Wright</strong> \u2013 As mentioned above, status is up in the air, and with him, it\u2019s really only about steals. But he racks them up. Only rostered in 8% of Yahoo\u2019s leagues.<br />\n<strong>Donte DiVincenzo</strong> \u2013 Numbers don\u2019t jump off the page, but he\u2019s useful (1.3 spg). Knicks have some interesting positional battles, which brings me to\u2026<br />\n<strong>Quentin Grimes</strong> \u2013 One of my favorite break out players for next season. I\u2019m incredibly sure he\u2019s going to put it all together. His defense hasn\u2019t translated to great steals numbers as of yet, but I\u2019m willing to bet money that he\u2019s gonna be a hot target soon. Propping up Quickley and Grimes makes me sound like a Knicks fan. Which I\u2019m definitely not. Only rostered in 20% of Yahoo\u2019s leagues.<br />\n<strong>Josh Green</strong> \u2013 Dallas has horrible depth, and horrible defense. Josh Green should see a lot more minutes this season, and he\u2019s a good defender. As with Grimes, the defense hasn\u2019t translated to great steals numbers as of yet, but he could get there soon. Rostered in 7% of Yahoo\u2019s leagues.<br />\n<strong>Jaden Springer</strong> \u2013 Only rostered in 1% of Yahoo\u2019s league for a reason. Still can\u2019t shoot, or score, really. But his defense is amazing. In the right built, he could be a fun player down the road (do the Sixers blow it up? And is Springer going to be part of any plans after that?), but right now the Sixers have a better, and more complete version of Springer in Melton.<br />\n<strong>Anthony Black</strong> \u2013 Only rostered in 10% of Yahoo\u2019s leagues, which is less than Suggs (13%), and I truely believe Black is going to kill it this season. Such a smart, strong and skilled player. I also think he\u2019ll be among the rookie leaders in steals per game. I\u2019m not too worried about Suggs, and I think he\u2019s also a better fit than Fultz.<br />\n<strong>Kris Dunn</strong> \u2013 Depending on how the Jazz back court shakes out (I believe Keyonte George will be starting before year\u2019s end), Dunn could win that starting PG position, as he did quite well for the Jazz later last season. If he does, he could be a top 5 player in steals per game. Interesting streamer, rostered in 8% of Yahoo\u2019s leagues.<br />\n<strong>Cam Whitmore</strong> \u2013 With KPjr being gone, minutes have just opened up for Whitmore, who could surprise a lot of people (rostered in 9%), as he can produce across the board if give minutes. Averaged 1.4 steals per game in college.<br />\n<strong>Dyson Daniels</strong> \u2013 Sometimes reminds me of Anthony Randolph, in the sense that he has so many tools and so much raw talent, yet he\u2019s also so incredibly\u2026 raw. A lot of the stuff he does seems to be relying on talent and instincts, but going back to the basics is hard for him. The Pelicans have quite a few options at guard, but I\u2019m interested to follow Daniels closely.<br />\n<strong>Jaylin Williams</strong> \u2013 I truely believe Chet Holmgren would play best, at least early on in his career, with Jaylin next to him. If Williams tops 24 mpg, he could be a useful source of steals at the C position. I think Jaylin Williams could develop into a player in the mold of an Al Horford (albeit the chance of reaching that same level is small).<br />\n<strong>Alex Caruso</strong> \u2013 Definitely belongs as a target for any team looking to add steals to its roster. Caruso will see enough minutes to be useful, and always comes through. With steals. Can you survive the lack of production in other cats?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://perkinsfor3.wordpress.com/2023/10/02/prince-among-thieves-securing-your-steals-2023-2024/\"><strong>https://perkinsfor3.wordpress.com/2023/10/02/prince-among-thieves-securing-your-steals-2023-2024/</strong></a></p></div>",

I beg to differ. So, Ayton goes from PHX to POR that means no more KD and Booker taking the shots, right? Well Simons shot it 19 times a game last season. Booker 20. Jerami Grant took just shy of 15 shots a game last year and now he has a huge contract and no Lillard usage. Expect that to be 17 or 18. You have Scoot coming in who will be sure to take more usage away along with Rookie pains. Sharpe is looking to emerge as a young star.  I just don't see from a points standpoint he gets any better. Rebounding is the only category I see him maybe taking a small leap in. He isnt a huge steals/blocks guy. So basically, you are looking at a small rebounding boost not to mention his prior work ethic rumors. That being said I am not swayed by the new team buzz. I don't see it much of a boost</p></div>",

Let's break down the instant fantasy takes.</p>\n<p>Fantasy WINNERS:</p>\n<p><strong>Dame Lillard</strong>: Dames value was falling the last few weeks as the possibility of a holdout loomed. You have to imagine the Bucks got some form of security from Dames camp that he would play. Dame is a first rounder when playing and he seems poised to lead a bucks offense and team that suddenly seems top heavy.</p>\n<p><strong>Deandre Ayton</strong>: He is going to get WAYYY more offensive opportunities on a trailblazers team that is in full rebuild mode. You would imagine the Blazers try and pump him and his stats up to make the Dame trade look better. There is a small chance he is retraded, but in our opinion its smaller than Jrue.</p>\n<p><strong>Grayson Allen:</strong> He is going to a super thin Suns team that has several players who could go down with an injury at any given time. Once Middleton came back last year Grayson fell off, but he has proven when given opportunity he can be fantasy relevent. The suns core should be drawing lots of doubles and creating open looks and Allen is a deadly catch and shoot player.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Fantasy Losers: </p>\n<p><strong>The Blazers</strong> Logjammed <strong>guards</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Jrue:</strong> Jrue now steps right into the limbo that Dame was in. He doesn't fit age wise in the direction the Trailblazers are going, and he could be rerouted before the deadline.</p>\n<p><strong>Simons &amp; Scoot:</strong> We thought they might have a clear path to the city (and they will still get a lot of touches even with Jrue) but now there are a firm 3 guards that need to play instead of the potential for 2 had the Dame trade brought back a wing and a big instead of a guard and a big. </p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Even value or not enough change to warrant a designation:</p>\n<p><strong>Nurk</strong> seems like a slight boost in value, but questions about his health remain the biggest hurdle, with as many great bigs as there are late in the draft I won't be reaching for him.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Who do you think won this trade?</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Link for our full reaction below</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/W0_yi5Ib9co?si=FMLlSNC5ytvdrwjt\">Trade Video</a></p></div>",
