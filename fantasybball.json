I know a lot of it is reading off the stat sheets, but there's a lot of color commentary behind each player and tidbits that one would only know if they were watching the games or putting insane amount of prep and reviewing the gamelogs prior to each taping.</p>\n<p>Random examples off the top of my head:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Knowing that Poeltl was INSANELY important to the Raptor's defence and if he went down, they were going to hemorrhage buckets - I have not heard of anyone talk about this other than actual Raptors fans like myself</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Knowing what quarters players foul out or get injured and come back to the game (this could be prep work and reviewing game logs)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Zagging on Cum Buckets when everyone was riding his dick. Quick aside - I think the general attention over Kuminga's potential stems from our boy Zach Lowe being SUPER high on him. No disrespect to Lowe since he's the goat at what he does, but people will latch onto a lot of shit he says without thinking for themselves - even front office people (if the rumors about ballot voting are to be believed)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Being super low on Dejounte Murray when he got traded to Atlanta. This was at this peak of \"Murray is a great player\" days</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Being super low on Naz Reid during the entire craze in the 2023-2024 season</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Zion walking away to the lockerroom after CJ's missed game winner (most recent example)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Obviously, he'll have a lot of missed takes too, but the point is that he's watching enough to form opinions outside of stats a.k.a the eyetest.</p>\n<p>Josh if you are reading this - do you just watch the NBA 10-minute recaps? Watch 2 games a night? How are you getting all the info on 8+ game days??</p>",

After 100+ mil contract in philly, you blow it at the end by averaging like 11 a game in the playoffs, shitting the bed vs the knicks and all together looking anemic and pedestrian even in the regular season. Then somehow, maybe through black magic, you get another stupid rich contract with the pistons, are in the prime of your career, your a 3 and D swingman, 6'7 on a shit team with nobody better but cade, a PG who will set you up, no expectations, and YET YOU STILL out here averaging like 14 points a game, doing damn near nothing, afraid to shoot in these meaningless games. WTF is wrong with this dude. He plays like the defintion of a flaccid penis. (Im mostly mad bc i spent a top 60 pick on him) but like what the hell is this? </p>",

But is it just a bad start?  </p>\n<p>He isn't shooting that far off from his career numbers and the Celtics aren't going to push him. I've always liked Jrue but he just looks terrible on offence right now every game I've seen him. Father time may have caught up with him a bit.  </p>\n<p>In cat leagues many probably drafted him expecting a top 75ish finish but that's looking unlikely.

It seems like my leaguemates with lower priority are always able to grab dropped players without worrying about the waiver order, while I\u2019m stuck sitting on top of the priority list, unsure when I should actually use it.</p>\n<p>My current situation is this: I\u2019m in an extremely tight matchup this week and have already picked up two streamers. My next worst players are pretty much undroppable, so I\u2019m wondering if it would be dumb to use my top waiver priority this week to grab another streamer and then claim one of my dropped players after the fact. That way, I could potentially give myself a better shot at winning this week\u2014though I\u2019d be giving up my top waiver priority in the process.</p>\n<p>Does this seem like a bad idea? Or does it make more sense to hold on to my waiver priority and hope that a better opportunity presents itself later on? I\u2019m having a hard time believing that a league mate would drop a player so valuable that I\u2019d regret not using it, but I also don\u2019t want to be left holding onto a high priority for no reason.</p>\n<p>Looking forward to hearing what others think</p>",
