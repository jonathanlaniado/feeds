With Dame gone and an increased role in his hands, he\u2019s averaging 27.1/5.3/3.1 on 3.8 3PM, and even about a steal per game as the cherry on top. There\u2019s nothing crazy about his %s either: 45.6% from the field and 40% from 3, while higher than his career averages, only are so slightly. As a developing star, and a lone wolf in the streets of Portland, how do we feel about these numbers moving forward? Do we sell high, or is his role legit moving forward? Does he get benched in April, or do they ride him out?</p>",

Whilst he\u2019s still averaging decent fp, he\u2019s been performing way below his adp. Reckon he\u2019s drafted late first to second round in most leagues, but he\u2019s performing like a 3rd/4th rounder. Not too sure when he\u2019s gg to get it going as seems carrying his trash teammates nightly has taken a toll on his motivation. Looks extraordinarily passive for a two time mvp</p>",

So, I'm trying a different angle. I've compiled a list of players who are playing at SF either comparably or less than Podziemski but already have SF eligibility. This isn't an exhaustive list; there might be others, but these are the ones I found from a bit of digging.

Examples are Jordan Poole, Jalen Green, RJ Barrett. The funny conundrum is that these players are usually rushed for the minute they hit the waivers. Has anyone actually had an improvement on their team for dropping these highly ranked players, or did you come to regret it?</p>",

Forget about guys that you draft high and get injured because you can't control that, or guys that get old and decline fast.  I'm thinking of guys that are widely considered to play at a certain level, there is data to back that up, the player is given the opportunity consistently, and they don't even come close to the projection/expectation. Gobert last year was a consideration, and there are a couple others like Darius Bazely, or James Wiseman, but not enough data to suggest they should have been good. Poole is different. There is a lot of data. There is no argument to be made at this point that it's in still early in the season. If you watch the guy play, he just doesn't care and he's consistently making bad decisions. He's actually, legitimately droppable. I think he might be the biggest bust in fantasy ever.</p>",

He's been doing it all it seems as his FT's not that bad also. Happy for the man that's been struggling to find a spot in the NBA and he's been a great pickup. With Kyrie gone and with no timetable I don't think he's a bad pickup for anyone 10-12Ts above. Sure he won't be like this the whole time Kyrie gone but I think he's good enough to be at the very least your last picked player. </p>",

I can't complain that much, the out of position rebounds and blocks are really nice, but I (and I imagine most people) took him partly for the steals and efficiency, both of which have been fairly shocking.</p>\n<p>He's currently averaging 12/7/5 with 0.7 steals and 0.9 blocks, on 42/82 splits. This steals number is by far the lowest of his career (previously 1.1 in his rookie season) as is his FG% (he previously hadn't shot below 45% FG since 2016). The drop in points was to be expected as the 4th-5th option in the starting lineup, next to the Jays who are both very high usage players, and the assists are also fine considering his role. But I didn't expect such a huge dropoff in efficiency.</p>\n<p>Looking at his numbers on BBRef the only major outlier in his FG% by zone is his shots from 10-16ft, which constitute 10% of his shot diet yet have only gone in 20% of the time. His percentages from everywhere else on the court are actually exceeding his career numbers.</p>\n<p>Again, I won't claim to have watched him play much, but going off these numbers I think it's reasonable to expect those midrange shots to start going in which should bring his overall FG% back up. I still don't know what to think about the steals though...</p>",
