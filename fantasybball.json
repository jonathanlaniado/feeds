I have moved up into 11th place! So that's a small celebration. lol. (I do believe this is likely to be my worst team of any team that I have this year and really the worst team I have ever had in many years. I have NEVER finished dead last in a league EVER) It's a struggle with being 14 games behind 6th place for a playoffs spot. (Still alive technically, but ouch) I will need to string together a bunch of 6-3 wins (maybe a few 5-4) and really with this squad that is VERY difficult. Anyway here is the update on moves!   </p>\n<p>I dropped:</p>\n<p>WCJ (obvious) </p>\n<p>Jared Vanderbilt (streamer)  </p>\n<p>Coulibaly (may look to re-add)   </p>\n<p>I added:</p>\n<p>Trayce Jackson Davis  </p>\n<p>Mitchell Robinson (IL stash) </p>\n<p>Pat Connaughton (schedule stream)   </p>\n<p>Also should mention last week adds because I didn't do an update last week... I scooped up ANDRE DRUMMOND for 12 faab! Yeah boy! I re-added Podziemski on Christmas Day for 6 faab. Then Paul Reed and Jared Vanderbilt were streamed in.   </p>\n<p>So now the team update as it stands right now and why I roster them:  </p>\n<p>PG Tyus Jones (FG% for guard, STLS, TO)</p>\n<p>SG Matisse Thybulle (elite steals/blocks, TO)</p>\n<p>G Brandin Podziemski (FG% for guard, REBS for guard, STL) </p>\n<p>SF Tari Eason (REBS, STLS, BLOCKS) </p>\n<p>PF Trayce Jackson-Davis (FG%, BLOCKS) </p>\n<p>F Josh Hart (FG%, REBS, sorta STLS)</p>\n<p>C Okongwu (FG%, REBS, BLOCKS, FT%)</p>\n<p>C Isiah Hartenstein (FG%, REBS, STLS for a big, BLOCKS)</p>\n<p>UTL Nick Richards (FG%, REBS, BLOCKS)</p>\n<p>UTL Andre Drummond (FG%, REBS, STLS, BLOCKS) </p>\n<p>Bnch Derrick Lively (FG%, REBS, BLOCKS) soon to be IL.</p>\n<p>Bnch Cole Anthony (REBS for guard, FT% volume)</p>\n<p>Bnch Pat Connaughton (schedule shenanigan streamer)</p>\n<p>IL Mitchell Robinson  </p>\n<p>I lost last week 3-6 because I only won FG%, REBS, TO. It was a real close battle for steals and blocks. My current matchup (against the 2nd place team)  I\"m ahead 5-4 as I lead FG%, REBS, STLS, BLOCKS TO exactly how things SHOULD go... I'm way behind in FT%. Way behind in AST, way behind in PTS and THREES as usual. I got hit with empty roster spots on WED with Cole Anthony not playing and Tari Eason not playing. (One reason I dropped Coulibaly is because he would have been on my bench and I thought Eason would be in there WED). Drummond and Hartenstein been huge for me this week! </p>\n<p>Isiah Jackson might be an option at PF. Draymond Green is also available (but I am punting AST). I might replace G Cole Anthony with SG Ausar Thompson and hope he regains his previous form? (I don't think Cole Anthony and Okongwu are enough to win FT%, but it's \"possible\" I suppose) I do need to have possibility of winning FT%...So might hold... Goga is also available and I do want to re add him for his useful skills. He could slot in to replace Lively.. (Those moves have to be made next week though since I only have one left for this week and it will be used for a Sunday streamer for Connaughton. (Schedule also dictates my moves so I can get max games) I could possibly trade Tyus Jones since he is my greatest \"rank value\" asset and really only brings me FG% and STLS as things I utilize, I really need those steals though! I'm already extremely strong in FG%... I wonder if I need to be able to win FT% each week... To do that would entail trading for Colin Sexton for his high FT% at high volume... (Sexton is a target for me cuz he shouldn't be as hard to obtain as someone like Jimmy Butler or other high FT% guys) This could give me the upside again of being able to win FG%, REBS, BLOCKS, TO, STLS, FT% total of 6 cats... And if somehow I can magically string enough 6 cat wins together I would be in the playoffs!!! (The odds of that of course are low). Still a chance! NEVER GIVE UP!   </p>\n<p>Stay tuned for an update on the team next week! </p>",

It's not that I don't trade, it's just he values his players too high. You can find some of the offers [here] (https://imgur.com/a/kQ14d5T).

Even Josh Lloyd, who spends a good amount of time on the value of almost every player, hardly ever goes in-depth on Bojan. </p>\n<p>His production recently has been extremely concerning but I think he would have to have three single digit scoring games in a row for anyone to notice. Lloyd is fixated on players like Klay (rightfully) and Curry &amp; Butler (confusingly) being washed but he never mentions the guy who went from 49-41-88 shooting splits last season to 45-38-74 shooting splits so far this season. He got off to an odd start getting like 3 steals in a few games but now has had 2 over the last 9 games. He doesn\u2019t get rebounds or assists with any type of reliability other than an outlier game every once in a while. </p>\n<p>I know he\u2019s bigger and has typically been more reliable in the past few years than these guys but I don\u2019t see much of a difference between the value of guys like Klay or Jordan Clarkson and him. He\u2019s had a serious decline thus far. I thankfully avoided him in 9CAT but was excited for his value in points. Well\u2026 he\u2019s averaging 27.1 fantasy points in my league and I\u2019m really considering dropping him since there are more exciting guys on the wire.</p>\n<p>What do you guys think of Bojan?</p>",

In those games he averaged 22.6 points, 5.4 rebounds and 5.1 assists with a FG% of 46.9%, 40.1% from deep (averaging 3.2/8.0 per game) and 85% from the free throw line (3.7/4.3 FGA per game).</p>\n<p>Now he finds himself in Toronto which I think is the perfect landing spot for him for several reasons:</p>\n<p>1) Toronto has very little guard depth; the only other serviceable guards on the team are Gary Trent Jr and Dennis Schroder. (I consider RJ Barret more of a SF)</p>\n<p>2) Dennis Schroder had been the starting PG for most of the season thus far, but he actually got benched recently and Scottie Barnes was given the starting point guard duties, so Toronto is clearly still trying to figure out the starting PG position here</p>\n<p>3) I think Toronto plans to re-sign him this off season when he becomes a restricted free agent. I see him as being a long term piece for them. He has shown a lot of potential to be a starting guard in this league for many years and given his current age of 24, he\u2019s basically about to enter his prime in the very near future and Toronto will want to pair him with Barnes as two long term key pieces for them</p>\n<p>4) Darko Rajakovic is most skilled at player development as a coach and will focus on that with Quickley. It would be foolish not to give Quickley tons of playing time and put the ball in his hands</p>\n<p>Currently, Quickley is rostered in 40% of ESPN leagues, but I suspect that number will increase very soon. As soon as Quickley gets settled into his new role on the team, I expect him to do great things!</p>\n<p>Get him while he\u2019s still available, I already did!</p>",

With Dame gone and an increased role in his hands, he\u2019s averaging 27.1/5.3/3.1 on 3.8 3PM, and even about a steal per game as the cherry on top. There\u2019s nothing crazy about his %s either: 45.6% from the field and 40% from 3, while higher than his career averages, only are so slightly. As a developing star, and a lone wolf in the streets of Portland, how do we feel about these numbers moving forward? Do we sell high, or is his role legit moving forward? Does he get benched in April, or do they ride him out?</p>",

Whilst he\u2019s still averaging decent fp, he\u2019s been performing way below his adp. Reckon he\u2019s drafted late first to second round in most leagues, but he\u2019s performing like a 3rd/4th rounder. Not too sure when he\u2019s gg to get it going as seems carrying his trash teammates nightly has taken a toll on his motivation. Looks extraordinarily passive for a two time mvp</p>",
