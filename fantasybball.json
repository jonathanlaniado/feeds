He's avging 26/6/9 on 46/86 shooting, 2 triples and 1 steal. Basically an improvement in every cat from last year aside from TOs. BBM has him as the 30th ranked player but if you punt TOs - which I think a lot of people do - he's actually the 9th ranked player this season. </p>\n<p>Is there a chance that he makes his way to the first round, top 12 next year? If so, who would he replace? I can see a lot of people opting for Cade over Tatum, given that Cade brings in those elite assists and his rebounds and scoring are pretty much just as good. I don't think a lot of people would be drafting Ant in the first round either. AD might fall as well given his injury concerns and the Mavs being broken and directionless. </p>\n<p>Thoughts?</p>",

Other than that, most injury reports from the usual suspects (Charlotte, Washington, and Memphis) actually look pretty empty, so some speculation might have to be done in order to get consistent value. Utah does look to have opted to make today a tanking day (everyday is tank day for them though I guess), and that could leave value for players like KJ Martin and Kyle Filipowski.

Adding these players are often the difference between winning your league and not, so getting a good feel for who has the highest upside to close out the season is almost mandatory for those with March playoff schedules. </p>\n<p>This article features the first five players from the list, with the second part likely dropping tomorrow to round out the list of valuable adds. Players highlighted here are Jonathan Mogbo (Raptors), Damion Baugh (Hornets), Jared Butler (76ers), Mo Gueye (Hawks), and Kyshawn George (Wizards). Inside the article is more reasoning behind why they were selected, potential upside they have, and their path to winning your league. </p>\n<p>Are there any other guys from these teams you are looking out for? I personally believe that the Hornets in particular are the team to keep an eye on, as they have to no heir apparent to absorb the load from LaMelo. </p>",

Furthermore, now is a great time to take a step back and remain a bit objective when viewing your team (a level head when viewing potential drop candidates is one of the best traits a manager can have). </p>\n<p>This week, we feature three players who can surge in their rest of season roles (Toumani Camara, Matas Buzelis, and Georges Niang), while also highlighting some strong drop candidates (De\u2019Andre Hunter, Goga Bitadze, and Jalen Smith). Keep in mind that each pick on the list is format specific, and the reasoning behind each pick is including in the article.</p>\n<p>As always, if you have any questions, feel free to ask! </p>",

For me I\u2019m already gonna call him a league winner cause he is simply him. But is he a shutdown risk , he\u2019s basically the first option now and with more usage due to dejounte being out , cj is being kinda washed and Zion missing games , it\u2019s all open for him , would love to know what you guys thinking about him?</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>The vibes in Atlanta have gone from being immaculate down to nonexistent over the course of the last month. With crippling injuries to Jalen Johnson and Zaccharie Risacher compounding with the nagging injuries often faced from Trae Young, DeAndre Hunter, and Bogdan Bogdanovich, the Hawks are all out of capable ball handlers sans Vit Krejci. Vit has long been a guy celebrated in Hawks fan circles without receiving nearly as much acclaim from other fanbases, however he has slowly been proving his worth to the entire league over the last few weeks. </p>\n<p>As of now, given the epic shooting slumps to the rest of his teammates as of late, Krejci is currently the Hawks most reliable shooter in the starting lineup. Over the last two weeks (in which he has started every game), Krejci is tallying 2.9 threes per game. This puts him on par with players such as Desmond Bane and Devin Booker in that timeframe, with a Z-Score of .89 for the category. The important Hawks players often struggle with making open threes, so having a highly capable shooter like Vit is a godsend when it comes to alleviating pressure around the rim. He has even managed to take his production up to a new level over the course of the last week, as injuries to Johnson and Risacher have opened up more opportunity for him on that front. The last week has seen him average 3.8 threes per game, with Krejci returning first round value in the category during that duration. </p>\n<p>Krejci also provides great defensive value for a guard eligible player, often functioning as the second best defender in the Hawks rotation after Dyson Daniels. Over the last two weeks, Krejci has tallied 1 block per game, allowing him to be one of the best guard eligible shot blockers in the league. As a 6'8\" guard, it is no surprise that he is able to use his size to his advantage in that category, and he has always averaged stable block numbers no matter how many minutes he plays (currently .5 bpg in 19 mpg on the season). He also has solid steals ability, pulling in 6 steals in his last 4 games played this week. This number places him at a Z-Score of .51 over that duration, and is his second best category in the last week (turnovers don't count). </p>\n<p>As a Hawks fan myself, it is incredibly refreshing to see Krejci play at such a high level while remaining levelheaded and confident on the court. He is a Swiss Army knife capable of filling in for any position 1-4 for the team, and just does a ton to even give us a hope of winning through our injury hell. He is an underrated passer as well, with an assist to turnover ratio of 11:1 over the last two weeks (4.3 apg and .4 to). While he does struggle to score with volume,, make free throws consistently, or grab a ton of boards, Krejci is just incredibly valuable in nearly every other facet of a 9Cat league. The Hawks have an excellent schedule next week, and Krejci is currently ranked 50th over the last two weeks, making him an easy lock to make most rosters in the upcoming week (potentially longer if Risacher, Johnson, and Hunter miss more time). </p>\n<p>Strong Cats: Threes, Steals, Blocks, Turnovers, Assists, Field Goal Percentage</p>\n<p>Weak Cats: Points, Rebounds, Free Throw Percentage</p>\n<p>Add Priority: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2605</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/coast2coastnba.bsky.social/post/3lgob35leek2e\">https://bsky.app/profile/coast2coastnba.bsky.social/post/3lgob35leek2e</a></p>",
