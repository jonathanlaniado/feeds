This ranks him #16 on bbm for category leagues, which is way above his drafted ADP.</p>\n<p>What is the sentiment on his production so far? Do we think he can continue producing like this IF and when Kawhi returns? Or is he a sell high candidate? From my opinion watching Clippers games, he looks like an absolute dawg out there with a Kobe-esque mentality and I have no doubts he can keep these numbers up (except the shooting efficiency).</p>\n<p>His \"addition by subtraction\" quote is also so damn cold. Front runner for MIP imo and probably (knock on wood) a league winner if you drafted him!</p>",

Even i'm joining the discourse and starting to question, is he really a better franchise pick than someone like Lamelo ball? <br />\nI assume we should just give him the benefit of the doubt and assume he dealing with an injury or something?? but to clarify have we seen something like this before?

Due to Atlanta Hawk homerism, I have Trae Young as my oldest keeper. I also had Anthony Edwards as one going into last year's draft, where I won the first pick tournament, securing the rights to Victor Wembanyama. In a stroke of Orlando Magic, I have the number one selection this year too, and was INCREDIBLY excited about the future with my core. </p>\n<p>Last Monday, with no word from the commissioner on draft date or dues owed, I texted the co-commish to ask when we were getting this year going. He said he just wasn't excited about it and hadn't done anything to move the process along. So I texted the main commissioner and he said he just wasn't feeling it this year either. </p>\n<p>So, here I sit with a multi-year contending nucleus, watching the last day we could conceivably submit our keepers and conduct a draft slowly tick away. And I'm a little heartbroken because even with another fantasy league, I won't have these same players that I feel so excited about. It just sucks, and there's so few people on the planet who would get it, so I felt like this group might would understand. </p>",

Punting blocks is always a good option, but it is especially effective now that we have to deal with Wemby. He becomes a lot less scary to go up against when you are not trying to win swats. It's also a nice alternative to punt FG%. It comes with many of the same benefits, and unlike punt FG%, it's not a super common strategy. You could have the strategy to yourself which will make picking up the top targets for the build much easier. Usually, when you punt FG%, you are competing for a small group of players with 3 or 4 other teams.</p>\n<p>Here are the guides:</p>\n<p>Yahoo - <a href=\"https://elitefantasybasketball.com/24-25-punt-blocks-yahoo/\"><strong>24/25 Punt Blocks Guide (Yahoo)</strong></a></p>\n<p>ESPN - <a href=\"https://elitefantasybasketball.com/24-25-punt-blocks-espn/\"><strong>24/25 Punt Blocks Guide (ESPN)</strong></a></p>\n<p>A quick note on the ESPN guide (and the other ESPN guides on the site). I am mostly ignoring their rankings because they are straight garbage this year. I'm not going to put out a guide that recommends waiting until the ninth to grab DeMar DeRozan because he's ranked there on ESPN. My approach is to place players slightly lower than they are on Yahoo if ESPN has them well below where they should be going. For example, on Yahoo, Ayton is ranked around the 5/6 turn. That's where he is in the Yahoo guide. On ESPN, he's ranked 149th for some reason. He's obviously not going to go in that range in many leagues, but I have bumped him down to the seventh because the default rankings will have some impact on where he is drafted in most leagues.</p>\n<p>Guides for punt assists, punt FG%, punt FT%, punt threes, punt points, and punt steals are also available. So are pairing guides for the first two and six rounds. Projections and various Top 150s are available as well and are updated throughout preseason, and in the case of the projections, throughout the regular season. You can see all the content available on the site here:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://elitefantasybasketball.com/24-25-draft-season-content-tracker/\"><strong>24/25 Draft Season Content Tracker</strong></a></p>\n<p>If you've got any fantasy basketball-related questions feel free to ask me here or on X\u00a0<a href=\"https://twitter.com/AdamGStock\"><strong>https://twitter.com/AdamGStock</strong></a></p>\n<p>Good luck with your drafts!</p>",

I was winning 4 categories by a landslide and was winning turnovers by 2. All I had to do was sit my guys and it was over\u2026</p>\n<p>Of course it couldn\u2019t be that simple! </p>\n<p>I was working in a bad cell service area all day yesterday and the only two guys that actually got benched were Herb and Harden everyone else stayed active. I go about the rest of my day thinking that I had won, it was over, there was no way I could lose. I get home a few minutes after 6, check my team and see that Butler and Allen are both still in my lineup. The changes I made didn\u2019t actually go through because of my bad cell service and they are playing. At that point, I knew that I was going to lose assists so I put the rest of my guys in hoping that I could catch steals, which I was only 3 behind on. Unfortunately, Herb Jones and James Harden had a combined 5 steals and were now sitting on my bench!!! I end the season losing steals by 1. BY ONE!!! \u2026With 5 steals sitting on my bench. </p>\n<p>I Win the League and $2000, Had I: \nA) Sat All My Players\nB) Played All My Players\nC) Just Played Herb Jones\nD) Double Checked my Lineup 5 minutes earlier</p>\n<p>I feel like both JR Smith and LeBron James yelling at JR Smith. This one REALLY stings and is going to for a while. Especially because I actually did make the changes and my phone just didn\u2019t process it. No one to blame but myself. From now on, if I\u2019m ever in the championship again I\u2019m taking the week off work. </p>\n<p>Hope everyone else is having a better morning than me!</p>",
