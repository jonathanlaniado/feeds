Due to Atlanta Hawk homerism, I have Trae Young as my oldest keeper. I also had Anthony Edwards as one going into last year's draft, where I won the first pick tournament, securing the rights to Victor Wembanyama. In a stroke of Orlando Magic, I have the number one selection this year too, and was INCREDIBLY excited about the future with my core. </p>\n<p>Last Monday, with no word from the commissioner on draft date or dues owed, I texted the co-commish to ask when we were getting this year going. He said he just wasn't excited about it and hadn't done anything to move the process along. So I texted the main commissioner and he said he just wasn't feeling it this year either. </p>\n<p>So, here I sit with a multi-year contending nucleus, watching the last day we could conceivably submit our keepers and conduct a draft slowly tick away. And I'm a little heartbroken because even with another fantasy league, I won't have these same players that I feel so excited about. It just sucks, and there's so few people on the planet who would get it, so I felt like this group might would understand. </p>",

Punting blocks is always a good option, but it is especially effective now that we have to deal with Wemby. He becomes a lot less scary to go up against when you are not trying to win swats. It's also a nice alternative to punt FG%. It comes with many of the same benefits, and unlike punt FG%, it's not a super common strategy. You could have the strategy to yourself which will make picking up the top targets for the build much easier. Usually, when you punt FG%, you are competing for a small group of players with 3 or 4 other teams.</p>\n<p>Here are the guides:</p>\n<p>Yahoo - <a href=\"https://elitefantasybasketball.com/24-25-punt-blocks-yahoo/\"><strong>24/25 Punt Blocks Guide (Yahoo)</strong></a></p>\n<p>ESPN - <a href=\"https://elitefantasybasketball.com/24-25-punt-blocks-espn/\"><strong>24/25 Punt Blocks Guide (ESPN)</strong></a></p>\n<p>A quick note on the ESPN guide (and the other ESPN guides on the site). I am mostly ignoring their rankings because they are straight garbage this year. I'm not going to put out a guide that recommends waiting until the ninth to grab DeMar DeRozan because he's ranked there on ESPN. My approach is to place players slightly lower than they are on Yahoo if ESPN has them well below where they should be going. For example, on Yahoo, Ayton is ranked around the 5/6 turn. That's where he is in the Yahoo guide. On ESPN, he's ranked 149th for some reason. He's obviously not going to go in that range in many leagues, but I have bumped him down to the seventh because the default rankings will have some impact on where he is drafted in most leagues.</p>\n<p>Guides for punt assists, punt FG%, punt FT%, punt threes, punt points, and punt steals are also available. So are pairing guides for the first two and six rounds. Projections and various Top 150s are available as well and are updated throughout preseason, and in the case of the projections, throughout the regular season. You can see all the content available on the site here:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://elitefantasybasketball.com/24-25-draft-season-content-tracker/\"><strong>24/25 Draft Season Content Tracker</strong></a></p>\n<p>If you've got any fantasy basketball-related questions feel free to ask me here or on X\u00a0<a href=\"https://twitter.com/AdamGStock\"><strong>https://twitter.com/AdamGStock</strong></a></p>\n<p>Good luck with your drafts!</p>",

I was winning 4 categories by a landslide and was winning turnovers by 2. All I had to do was sit my guys and it was over\u2026</p>\n<p>Of course it couldn\u2019t be that simple! </p>\n<p>I was working in a bad cell service area all day yesterday and the only two guys that actually got benched were Herb and Harden everyone else stayed active. I go about the rest of my day thinking that I had won, it was over, there was no way I could lose. I get home a few minutes after 6, check my team and see that Butler and Allen are both still in my lineup. The changes I made didn\u2019t actually go through because of my bad cell service and they are playing. At that point, I knew that I was going to lose assists so I put the rest of my guys in hoping that I could catch steals, which I was only 3 behind on. Unfortunately, Herb Jones and James Harden had a combined 5 steals and were now sitting on my bench!!! I end the season losing steals by 1. BY ONE!!! \u2026With 5 steals sitting on my bench. </p>\n<p>I Win the League and $2000, Had I: \nA) Sat All My Players\nB) Played All My Players\nC) Just Played Herb Jones\nD) Double Checked my Lineup 5 minutes earlier</p>\n<p>I feel like both JR Smith and LeBron James yelling at JR Smith. This one REALLY stings and is going to for a while. Especially because I actually did make the changes and my phone just didn\u2019t process it. No one to blame but myself. From now on, if I\u2019m ever in the championship again I\u2019m taking the week off work. </p>\n<p>Hope everyone else is having a better morning than me!</p>",

I call it \"Trade Tuesday\". I usually (not always) send out six trades (maximum that yahoo allows) in most of my leagues and continue conversations from previous weeks or start up new ones. (I save all kinds of notes so I know how each manager values players which helps you get a deal done). Sometimes people counter with a good offer that you surprisingly didn't expect! For me this is still my Tuesday night even though I'm aware that technically it is Wednesday. Warning that this is my most speculative post in my history and you will very rarely ever see this much speculation from me! So... </p>\n<p>What are some of your players that you are targeting right now both to TRADE AWAY or TRADE FOR?</p>\n<p>My TRADE FOR: (for my team build) it's James Harden, Scottie Barnes, Fox, Sabonis, (that SAC playoffs schedule!!!), Evan Mobley (CLE great schedule too), Gafford, Tre Jones (still don't have enough of him despite being on many of my teams), Ben Simmons (you can laugh, but he does have significant upside in a punt pts build). Zubacs. Poeltl. Okongwu. Rudy Gobert but it is hard to pry him away and I don't want to give up too much, but still trying to trade for him. One of my negotiations for him the owner trying to really rip me off and I wont' have that! </p>\n<p>Trying to TRADE AWAY: Jimmy Butler, Derrick Lively (cuz the two game playoff week), Jrue Holiday because I want more AST than what he is providing, Anfernee Simons Id like to move... I have entertained the idea of Haliburton for Harden but haven't fully made that offer. (Of course I would need extra in return) </p>\n<p>A trade that I did make!!! Last week I traded with my \"Rival\" (From baseball where we both faced off in two different public money leagues in the championship game! I won one, he won the other!) I traded away Okongwu for Ben Simmons. (Might regret that move and truly I already do considering the Capela injury), but I quickly replaced the Okongwu FG%, REBS and BLOCKS with Nick Richards so it was a net gain for my team! (Big reason why I made the trade) Ben Simmons is unique pizza with unique toppings (Punt PTS, FT%, THREES) who doesn't fit everyone (and you might be allergic) so no this isn't a glowing endorsement for everyone to go trade for Simmons. lol. (He has looked great in a few of his games now though even though clearly he will see rest games too often) He is an injury risk with his \"epidural required\" pregnancy back, yet plenty of upside too. He has only 13 games left from today Feb 7th to March 17th then those playoffs begin (for standard leagues) I'm factoring in that he will miss 5 back to back games in this span to keep him rested/healthy. (You may want to check those upcoming games played schedule too when you are considering trades. Some players will \"get you into the playoffs\" by playing more games and some players are more impactful when those playoffs begin)   </p>\n<p>It is worth mentioning that now might be a good time for some fantasy teams to pivot into a punt build... (You should be able to identify your team weaknesses and strong stats. You can use the tools on basketball monster team analysis page or you can also look up the team stats page if on yahoo) You may have too many injuries to compete in PTS categories or other counting stats like THREES, AST. Might be something to consider... It really would depend who is on your roster and injuries and your position in standings. Also how good you at working the wavier wire/streaming as well as who could be long term valuable to add/trade for. </p>\n<p>As the wise phrase goes, \"Sometimes the best trades we make are the trades WE DO NOT MAKE\". Some of your teams you may already have a super strong team and no need to trade.  </p>\n<p>-----  </p>\n<p>I also want to take a few moments to talk about the real NBA teams and some of the moves that might occur. Players that could have extra value if they were moved or players who would jump into a larger role on same team if others were moved: (An extremely nutty tough thing to tackle)   </p>\n<p>Andre Drummond. This is the number 1 stash target. He is being rumored to be involved in numerous trades. Where there is smoke there is usually a fire. And we have seen his fantasy upside when he gets starters minutes. If your team needs rebounds, steals, blocks, FG% he is a great speculative add in case he gets into a larger role because the upside is worth it. Then we saw him go absolutely nuts on Tuesday with 16pts, 16reb, 4blocks! I believe this was them showcasing him for a trade! They claimed it was to matchup with the twin towers of Gobert and KAT, but come on now, I think most of us know the real reason. They absolutely just  increased his trade appeal. I'm almost 100% certain he will be moved. But then again the bulls might bull. LOL.   </p>\n<p>Trayce Jackson Davis. If Looney and/or Wiggins was shipped off I believe it would give him a larger role. We have already see him do very well for his FG% and some blocks. If he could carve out a role around 6-7 rebs per game and over a block per game he would be fantasy worthy end of bench type of player and as we know the warriors extremely great schedule going forward from now all the way to rest of season. Same things can be said for Podziemski.   </p>\n<p>Dejounte Murray. Well it is rumored mostly with the Lakers and a DeAngelo Russell trade. I think it would downgrade Murray if that were to occur since he would get less rebounds and less scoring on the lakers team. Deangelo scoring would go up as Trae would find him often and he would be the 2nd scoring option. I guess it is possible they bring him in off the bench, but I reckon they would start him at SG. This trade may not go down too and there are other talks/negotiations occurring!   </p>\n<p>Scoot Henderson. We have seen flashes of upside on what Scoot can do with high volume of getting to the line and high amount of assists and high scoring usage. I do think the turnovers and low FG% will likely still be a problem all season, but for some of you those might be categories you are already punting. Even if brogdon stays in POR (and it seems likely lately that he may stay) you gotta think they let the young kid Scoot play a whole lot more rest of the way...   </p>\n<p>The MIL bucks. They are seeking \"upgrades\". So whoever they bring in as \"upgrades\" will be interesting and useful. Why? Because MIL has an incredible zesty playoff schedule the week of March 25th where they play TUES/THURS/SAT. Three quality games! Extremely beneficial for that week. It WILL catapult teams into winning that week if you have 2 or 3 players from them. There might be other higher value targets that move at deadline, but DO KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON MILWAUKEE. (same for New Orleans with same exact schedule, but they aren't linked as to actively looking for upgrades like MIL currently is) The main rumor is they are looking for a guard who can defend. (Caruso?). Also worth mentioning that Portis for Grant Williams was discussed between DAL and MIL... Pat Connaughton has an expiring contract and doesn't seem like a major part of their future so he is likely to be moved. Dorian Finney Smith has been linked to this and I wonder if Dinwiddie would also be included? (but his defense is bad) Also major injury to Middleton just occurred last night so I expect bucks to be VERY active buyers. </p>\n<p>Coulibaly. There are rumors that wizards may trade Kuzma to DAL. This would give Coulibaly minutes as a starter which might be good for his role. However if Tyus Jones is moved he wouldn't have as good of a passer around him. The wizards point guard situation could be completely different with both Tyus and Delon likely to be traded. Would this mean wizards would be going with \"point Deni\" as ballhandler? Might they start Kispert? Or will they bring in another guard via trade to start? Lots of dominoes...   </p>\n<p>Dorian Finney Smith/Royce ONeal trade rumors and how it benefits Ben Simmons. What do I mean? Well Ben is best when he is surrounded by pure shooters where his passing skills play up and he doesn't get as exposed for his lack of a jump shot. He also is benefited by someone who is fast/can run the floor on fast breaks with him. So if they bring in some shooters his value goes up cuz it seems he will be coming off the bench? (oh boy, way too much Ben Simmons talk in this post and I know those haters exist all over!) It is worth mentioning that if Dinwiddie is traded away Simmons would do very well as a starter...   </p>\n<p>Wiggins being rumored to the pacers or Mavs. This would boost his value IF it was to the Mavs (by playing with good passers Luka and Kyrie and being the third scoring option on that team) and various dominoes would fall depending on where he landed. Podziemski would have more security for minutes (depending on who would come back).  </p>\n<p>Jalen Green is in trade rumors. This could open even more doors for Amen Thompson or even Cam Whitmore. (Of course depending on who comes back) The nets were supposedly in talks with HOU.   </p>\n<p>Tyus Jones. He has been linked to talks with Lakers. I think if that happened his ast would go up. Approaching 8 or 9 per game with Lebron and AD around him. His scoring would come down a bit though and rebs go down/stay low. He has also been linked to Timberwolves where I would expect him to backup Conley? Or Conley would move to bench. It would certainly be a downgrade for whichever player comes off the bench.   </p>\n<p>Delon Wright. There are rumors about him possibly going to the kings. If that happened remember him as a streamer in playoffs due to schedule if begins on March 18th. (Celtics and Timberwolves also interested). There is also the short term value the kings have this week as they play FRI and SUN combo. Instead of keeping a fringe player on your bench for SAT you are more benefited to stream in a player who gets two games on those days. (The Celtics is the other team with that feature)   </p>\n<p>Celtics are looking for bench upgrades (obviously gee what a shock, lol) Just as I mentioned this could be quickly relevant for streaming right away this week FRI and SUN. (As well as maybe long term) So pay attention to it.   </p>\n<p>Jalen Brunson just hurt his ankle. Not sure of severity yet, but they did bring in Malachi Flynn a few weeks ago and I reckon he might step up, but also they might look to bring in another point guard as well. McBride could also step in and they just use Divincenzo and hart as the main ballhandlers? No doubt Knicks have playoff aspirations so I would expect them to be buyers? Maybe they go after Brogdon? (Knicks might need a replacement big man with Randle going down and uncertainty timeline of Robinson or is Precious the answer?!? He has looked good lately hasn't he? Maybe they are showcasing him for a trade too? Or maybe he has calmed that with his strong play?) The knicks have discussed a deal involving Bruce Brown for Evan Fournier and draft considerations.   </p>\n<p>Bruce Brown and Gary Trent Jr are looking to be moved by the Raptors. I would think they are looking to bring more scoring help to Scottie Barnes?   </p>\n<p>Kelly Olynyk expiring contract. Also might be on the move is Sexton? This could open up doors for Keyonte and a bit maybe for Kessler.   </p>\n<p>Monte Morris is highly likely to be traded and could be a name in deeper leagues that might find himself a quality role 4ish ast per game as a backup.   </p>\n<p>Kyle Lowry. Similar to Morris he could himself as a quality backup. (Might even be a starter? Sort of doubt it though) The hornets could also part ways with expiring contract of Gordon Hayward? Clearly they are sellers at deadline. PJ Washington is rumored as a target for the Mavs... That would clearly increase his value...Something to watch...   </p>\n<p>Chris Boucher. He appears set to be moved and has accepted/almost excited about it. He isn't part of the Raptors future plans. The MAVS are looking for a PF so this could be a real option that may materialize? We shall see...   </p>\n<p>Luke Kennard. Even though they aren't really showcasing him, he is a pure shooter. They might not be able to afford him next year and they don't need him for this year so it makes sense to turn the asset into something more for the future (next year or beyond) They already shipped away Steven Adams for the same luxury tax reason so it might make sense for them to do the same with Kennard. (Although I disagree and think they should have kept Steven Adams since they literally are very empty with bigs right now and Adams is damn good at setting screens and capable passer and defender despite lack of post moves/offensive game) Maybe that's the type of trade they will seek out is for big man? He should attract attention because of his skill set is always desired in the NBA. A landing spot could be Celtics as a bench scoring option maybe?   </p>\n<p>Bones Hyland. He might go to the Timberwolves as their backup point guard. (same executive who drafted him now runs Timberwolves) Ok cool. Deep leaguers that might be useful.   </p>\n<p>Of note: Players who DO move likely are NOT playing in the Thursday game they have scheduled and probably might not even play in the Friday game so pay attention to that with who you choose to stream. (Generally best not to stream until after the deadline, for future reference/future years) Each team has needs, wants and then there is the salary cap to make it complicated. So it is harder to get deals done then you think it is!!! Some various \"throw in\" players will be moved as salary dump plays and some other players might be included in trades in order to stay under the salary cap (despite not being a perfect fit for the new team). I think we could see some real unique lineups here (grizzlies style? nah grizzlies are seemingly just experimenting with stuff?) on Wednesday as teams \"showcase players for a trade\"... Could mean higher usage for players that teams are trying to move... (Kennard 60 point game incoming, book it, LOL. It's funny, but the dude was actually insane in high school) (Probably more of a DFS situation to pay attention to rather than season long leagues, but it might affect your overs/under lines too) </p>\n<p>With all of that said, What are some of your trade plans and your negotiations today/this week? Are you waiting to trade until after the NBA trade deadline? (Probably the best move) Are you still negotiating? What players are you stashing/adding in hopes they get traded at the deadline?  What rumors do you think have the most credence? What are players you think are on the move and the ramifications? Let's discuss? Remember that rumors are exactly that, SPECULATION and not facts. (Winning fantasy basketball is undeniably more about focusing on the facts) And truly factually I must say that you shouldn't be making moves based on speculation unless that upside is worth it and/or your league is hyper competitive and you are worried you might miss out on a player. Those are the situations that it might be worth it. Last year Mark Williams was a massive winner at the deadline and many people correctly stashed him in advance of it! Most years though, things do not work out that way... A forewarning...   </p>\n<p>If you have questions will try to reply to your questions, but I do have alot going on today and at my real job I work late into the evenings so I apologize if it takes me extra time to respond. (Fantasy trades should be carefully analyzed anyway and not to rush it) Let's have some fun with this!!! </p>",
