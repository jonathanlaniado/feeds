For me I\u2019m already gonna call him a league winner cause he is simply him. But is he a shutdown risk , he\u2019s basically the first option now and with more usage due to dejounte being out , cj is being kinda washed and Zion missing games , it\u2019s all open for him , would love to know what you guys thinking about him?</p>",

            "title": "Name of the Night 1/25 - Vit \"Pistol Vit\" Krejci",
            "content_html": "<p>The vibes in Atlanta have gone from being immaculate down to nonexistent over the course of the last month. With crippling injuries to Jalen Johnson and Zaccharie Risacher compounding with the nagging injuries often faced from Trae Young, DeAndre Hunter, and Bogdan Bogdanovich, the Hawks are all out of capable ball handlers sans Vit Krejci. Vit has long been a guy celebrated in Hawks fan circles without receiving nearly as much acclaim from other fanbases, however he has slowly been proving his worth to the entire league over the last few weeks. </p>\n<p>As of now, given the epic shooting slumps to the rest of his teammates as of late, Krejci is currently the Hawks most reliable shooter in the starting lineup. Over the last two weeks (in which he has started every game), Krejci is tallying 2.9 threes per game. This puts him on par with players such as Desmond Bane and Devin Booker in that timeframe, with a Z-Score of .89 for the category. The important Hawks players often struggle with making open threes, so having a highly capable shooter like Vit is a godsend when it comes to alleviating pressure around the rim. He has even managed to take his production up to a new level over the course of the last week, as injuries to Johnson and Risacher have opened up more opportunity for him on that front. The last week has seen him average 3.8 threes per game, with Krejci returning first round value in the category during that duration. </p>\n<p>Krejci also provides great defensive value for a guard eligible player, often functioning as the second best defender in the Hawks rotation after Dyson Daniels. Over the last two weeks, Krejci has tallied 1 block per game, allowing him to be one of the best guard eligible shot blockers in the league. As a 6'8\" guard, it is no surprise that he is able to use his size to his advantage in that category, and he has always averaged stable block numbers no matter how many minutes he plays (currently .5 bpg in 19 mpg on the season). He also has solid steals ability, pulling in 6 steals in his last 4 games played this week. This number places him at a Z-Score of .51 over that duration, and is his second best category in the last week (turnovers don't count). </p>\n<p>As a Hawks fan myself, it is incredibly refreshing to see Krejci play at such a high level while remaining levelheaded and confident on the court. He is a Swiss Army knife capable of filling in for any position 1-4 for the team, and just does a ton to even give us a hope of winning through our injury hell. He is an underrated passer as well, with an assist to turnover ratio of 11:1 over the last two weeks (4.3 apg and .4 to). While he does struggle to score with volume,, make free throws consistently, or grab a ton of boards, Krejci is just incredibly valuable in nearly every other facet of a 9Cat league. The Hawks have an excellent schedule next week, and Krejci is currently ranked 50th over the last two weeks, making him an easy lock to make most rosters in the upcoming week (potentially longer if Risacher, Johnson, and Hunter miss more time). </p>\n<p>Strong Cats: Threes, Steals, Blocks, Turnovers, Assists, Field Goal Percentage</p>\n<p>Weak Cats: Points, Rebounds, Free Throw Percentage</p>\n<p>Add Priority: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2605</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/coast2coastnba.bsky.social/post/3lgob35leek2e\">https://bsky.app/profile/coast2coastnba.bsky.social/post/3lgob35leek2e</a></p>",

I know a lot of it is reading off the stat sheets, but there's a lot of color commentary behind each player and tidbits that one would only know if they were watching the games or putting insane amount of prep and reviewing the gamelogs prior to each taping.</p>\n<p>Random examples off the top of my head:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Knowing that Poeltl was INSANELY important to the Raptor's defence and if he went down, they were going to hemorrhage buckets - I have not heard of anyone talk about this other than actual Raptors fans like myself</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Knowing what quarters players foul out or get injured and come back to the game (this could be prep work and reviewing game logs)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Zagging on Cum Buckets when everyone was riding his dick. Quick aside - I think the general attention over Kuminga's potential stems from our boy Zach Lowe being SUPER high on him. No disrespect to Lowe since he's the goat at what he does, but people will latch onto a lot of shit he says without thinking for themselves - even front office people (if the rumors about ballot voting are to be believed)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Being super low on Dejounte Murray when he got traded to Atlanta. This was at this peak of \"Murray is a great player\" days</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Being super low on Naz Reid during the entire craze in the 2023-2024 season</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Zion walking away to the lockerroom after CJ's missed game winner (most recent example)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Obviously, he'll have a lot of missed takes too, but the point is that he's watching enough to form opinions outside of stats a.k.a the eyetest.</p>\n<p>Josh if you are reading this - do you just watch the NBA 10-minute recaps? Watch 2 games a night? How are you getting all the info on 8+ game days??</p>",

After 100+ mil contract in philly, you blow it at the end by averaging like 11 a game in the playoffs, shitting the bed vs the knicks and all together looking anemic and pedestrian even in the regular season. Then somehow, maybe through black magic, you get another stupid rich contract with the pistons, are in the prime of your career, your a 3 and D swingman, 6'7 on a shit team with nobody better but cade, a PG who will set you up, no expectations, and YET YOU STILL out here averaging like 14 points a game, doing damn near nothing, afraid to shoot in these meaningless games. WTF is wrong with this dude. He plays like the defintion of a flaccid penis. (Im mostly mad bc i spent a top 60 pick on him) but like what the hell is this? </p>",
