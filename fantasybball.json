It seems like my leaguemates with lower priority are always able to grab dropped players without worrying about the waiver order, while I\u2019m stuck sitting on top of the priority list, unsure when I should actually use it.</p>\n<p>My current situation is this: I\u2019m in an extremely tight matchup this week and have already picked up two streamers. My next worst players are pretty much undroppable, so I\u2019m wondering if it would be dumb to use my top waiver priority this week to grab another streamer and then claim one of my dropped players after the fact. That way, I could potentially give myself a better shot at winning this week\u2014though I\u2019d be giving up my top waiver priority in the process.</p>\n<p>Does this seem like a bad idea? Or does it make more sense to hold on to my waiver priority and hope that a better opportunity presents itself later on? I\u2019m having a hard time believing that a league mate would drop a player so valuable that I\u2019d regret not using it, but I also don\u2019t want to be left holding onto a high priority for no reason.</p>\n<p>Looking forward to hearing what others think</p>",

This ranks him #16 on bbm for category leagues, which is way above his drafted ADP.</p>\n<p>What is the sentiment on his production so far? Do we think he can continue producing like this IF and when Kawhi returns? Or is he a sell high candidate? From my opinion watching Clippers games, he looks like an absolute dawg out there with a Kobe-esque mentality and I have no doubts he can keep these numbers up (except the shooting efficiency).</p>\n<p>His \"addition by subtraction\" quote is also so damn cold. Front runner for MIP imo and probably (knock on wood) a league winner if you drafted him!</p>",
