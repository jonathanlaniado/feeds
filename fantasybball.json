That was a 5 year college career of 154 games. (larger sample size) He had a very nice game tonight as well... 14pts, 4threes, 5rebs, 8ast, 1stl, 2turnovers. It would seem he has fairly large upside depending on his role/mins... (he had 34 mins here tonight) Little weaknesses to his game. (other than the pick and roll and lack of a vertical so likely less blocks) (I know Ja Morant eventually returns but if they continue to go small ball (with no Ziare Williams) he could be quite useful in short term?)   </p>\n<p>Pros: <br />\nNCAA all time steals leader</p>\n<p>Elite active hands</p>\n<p>Good shooting form</p>\n<p>Great spot up shooter</p>\n<p>Good assist: turnover ratio</p>\n<p>Efficient P&amp;R playmaker</p>\n<p>Great vision; sees beyond defenses in transition</p>\n<p>Gets defenders in the air on drive &amp; kicks, leading to easy assists to big men</p>\n<p>Thrives off give &amp; goes, which makes him elite in DHO</p>\n<p>Comfortable with both hands</p>\n<p>Quick footwork into jumpers</p>\n<p>Excellent feel for the game  </p>\n<p>Cons:</p>\n<p>Undersized with short arms</p>\n<p>Minimal threat on shot contests</p>\n<p>Below the rim finisher</p>\n<p>Low vertical</p>\n<p>Simple in P&amp;R as a passer</p>\n<p>Predictable P&amp;R scorer</p>\n<p>Makes tons of jump passes</p>\n<p>Old for the draft (turns 24 right after the draft)</p>\n<p>Low FG%; needs to be more efficient</p>\n<p>This is from his scouting report..... (It's not extremely impressive with his weakness in the pick and roll game, however it's there doesn't appear to be any other weaknesses to his game) </p>\n<p>\"Defensively, the book on ____ starts with his historic turnover-forcing ability. As the all-time leader in NCAA history for steals in a college career, ______ has a nose for the ball, whether it be with his active and accurate hands or his ability to read the passing lanes. While he will struggle to contest shots, his threat for forcing turnovers will be impactful on defense. He doesn\u2019t lose positioning when going for steals, which makes him a pest defensively. If a team can hide him effectively in playing to his strengths of forcing turnovers while reducing his weaknesses as a shot alterer, he will emerge as a neutral or slightly positive defender.  </p>\n<p>Offensively, ________ basketball IQ allows him to be a floor general, quick shooter off of dribble moves, and an off-ball threat as a spot-up shooter with a quick release. Despite being undersized, ________ does a good job of taking advantage of mismatches and shooting over defenders quickly, both in spot-ups and off the dribble and self-creation moves.  </p>\n<p>However, one college coach I spoke to noted his excellent college career and skills, but mentioned his limitations in using the pick &amp; roll, which opened my eyes to an area I had previously overlooked. While he is not remotely bad in the pick &amp; roll as a ball-handler, he is a simple playmaker, and somewhat predictable as a scorer out of ball-screen sets. On the year, _______ had rough numbers out of the pick &amp; roll, per Synergy: 63rd percentile in overall P&amp;R sets including passes, but he shot 29% out of P&amp;R sets on 109 attempts. He generally used two moves, a stepback and straight-line drives to the rim, off of screens. In order to stick in the NBA, he will have to be more creative out of screens both as a playmaker and scorer.  </p>\n<p>Overall, ______  being a nearly mistake-free player while creating tons of mistakes for opposing offensive players as a defender, while also possessing a good jump shot, make him an interesting dark-horse for a backup guard in the NBA. While other smaller players with overlapping skill-sets have not been able to make the leap to the NBA, ______ smooth jumper separates him in terms of skill-set from other undersized guards in the past.\"  </p>\n<p>Thoughts? </p>",

The incident reported in early October does not seem like it will cause an extended suspension as of this moment. Bridges is doing what he can to be ready to play and fantasy managers who are willing to ignore the off-court issues may want to stash him ahead of his return if he is available. Of course, he will likely need to shake off some rust and it is understandable if you'd prefer to compete without going near him.</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/ethosfantasybk/status/1723047698343895168?s=46&amp;t=W-xQix0DudmPRJOdU9dnoA</p>",

The guy can definitely shoot, but doesn\u2019t provide a ton else besides points.

You see, Will Hardy in his unfathomable brilliance has deduced that Kessler should stand at the perimeter and shoot 3s. This not only takes him out of the paint, thus decreasing his rebound and blocks but also ruins his fg% because the man has shot a total of like 3 three pointers last year. </p>\n<p>This also doesn't space the floor because players treat him like Ben Simmons out there and he won't get any looks cuz THT and Sexton have the combined IQ and the vision of loaf of bread. </p>\n<p>This CAN NOT be sustainable as a strategy. Im assuming it's a test run that is failing magnificently or he will be removed from the starting lineup all together. Both might actually be beneficial for us. </p>\n<p>I can't imagine I've ever seen a coach waste potential ROY talent like this in my life.</p>",

Grabbing at least 14 boards a game, shooting 80% from the field and averaging 2.7 blocks - he is flying, and he reminds me of a prime Andre Drummond.  It is clear that he is the #1 option at C for Detroit and his 1-2 punch combo with Cade is looking filthy.  While I believe he will be top 50 ROS, I question whether he can keep this top 10 production up. Sure the boards may stay, but 80% shooting will likely taper off.  Where do you see him finishing the season once/if this amazing start comes back to earth? Is he a sell high or is this realistic production? With that all being said, Is it worth selling him now for a guy like JJJ or Lauri in points leagues or another guy in that top 30-40 rank?</p>",

(mostly to appease your confirmation biases, but hopefully a tad more? haha)</p>\n<p>Jazz vs Suns</p>\n<p>Blowout game easy win despite being injured for the suns! They shot 53 as a team and 93% from the line! Wow! When you shoot that well usually you win. In addition they only had 11 turnovers! Suns are extremely good folks.</p>\n<p>Kevin Durant being that first round freak. 26pts on insane 8-11 FG, 9-9 FTM, 4rebs, 7ast, 1stl, 1block. As long as Beal and Booker are out continue to expect higher usage (esp the ast). Roto KING for how he boosts your percentages.</p>\n<p>Nurkic you would have thought stepped up more scoring but only had 10pts on 8 shots, still helped with 7rebs, 6ast, 2stl, 1blck. Only 23 mins? (probably cuz the blowout)</p>\n<p>Eric Gordon 21pts on 9-14FG, 3threes, 2rebs, 4ast, 1stl. Continue to ride while suns are injured. Might be able to trade him (sell high) to an unaware or \"newer\" or bad manager.</p>\n<p>Grayson Allen 17pts, 4rebs, 3ast, 2stl. Same story as Gordon, but probably has less trade appeal than Gordon does. He will be a quality stream for threes or pts numerous times this season.</p>\n<p>Okogie only 7pts, 1 reb, don't need to hold, but PHO good schedule next week so it's a must drop either. This is very disappointing.</p>\n<p>Drew Eubanks continues to be valuable 85% shooting, 12pts, 5rebs, 2ast, 2blocks. You use him for his FG%, REBS, BLOCKS. (holy trinity of big men). I think he will finish around top 125 even top 100 value even as a backup getting 19 min here.</p>\n<p>Jordan Goodwin 100% FTM (6-6), 2threes, 5rebs, 5ast, 1stl. Something to pay attention to for an AST streaming option. He shot 2-9 tho so will likely be a drain on your FG%.</p>\n<p>For Jazz:</p>\n<p>Lauri Markanan 19pts, (7-13), 5threes, 3rebs, 1stl, 2blocks. REBS a bit low, but still a nice game. His usage is high.</p>\n<p>John Collins 11pts, (5-9) 10rebs, 3ast. Nice double double but no defense here.</p>\n<p>Walker Kessler 2pts, 25% shooting albeit low volume so it \"hurts you less\" 1-4, (again he shot 2 threes), 5rebs, 1ast, 1block, 3turnovers. Obviously terrible. His playing time is low, John Collins continues to outrebound him. If Kessler is standing in the corner too often waiting for threes he won't be collecting rebs folks. So this is a huge concern. 3 games in now. You could probably BUY HIM VERY LOW. But I'm not even confident that he will get back to last year kessler. Still 3 games is a small sample size. And we KNOW the talent that kessler does have. Just don't know why the coach isn't utilizing him correctly or only giving him 23 mins. If you try to sell on him you would vastly not get proper value for how high his upside could be (mainly for FG%, REBS, BLOCKS) but really I don't know. I see a bit of writing on the wall and willing to re assess my preseason hype of kessler. This is a BIG PROBLEM. Is he even going to get those rebs or FG% if he is jacking up threes and hanging out in the corner? That would downgrade him to mostly a one category player in blocks. I am entertaining the possibility of trading him (I own him in many leagues) for a guy who is currently giving us \"similar stats of peak kessler\" like a Mitchell Robinson or Duren. (Likely easier to obtain Robinson of those two). Also Robinson is significantly better at steals both in past years and proven this year. (underrated little/big gem in punt pts teams) One thing is for sure, YOU DO NOT DROP. The other thing to mention here is Jazz are an experimental team. They clearly will not be winning and at some point tanking. So their play style and what the coach designs may fluctuate as season goes (or the coach gets fired). Thus the talent that kessler has (and oh boy is he a talented rebounder and blocker and FG%) SHOULD/MIGHT come back at some point? Might be a reason for optimism? I feel like in the comments Kessler will be a big discussion piece... I have said enough, moving on.</p>\n<p>Jordan Clarkson shot 30% only 2rebs, 2ast, 5 turnovers. Eek. He is usually pretty up and down, could likely score 25 next game. lol.</p>\n<p>Talen Horton Tucker 4pts on 1-7FG, 1ast, 1stl. I guess one positive is zero turnovers. If you need to stream to win your matchup you can let go of him, but could be a re-add next week or after. Bit of a fringe player and maybe not a long term part of the jazz future? (none of us know for sure tho) He would need to play himself into continue to get starts and this is NOT IT. Only 16mins too (but I reckon that's cuz there was garbage time minutes for backups) You want players who are surging, who have upside or trade appeal. THT does not have that. He is now shooting 26% on the season. Matter of time before Sexton/George/Dunn starts instead. Might happen as soon as next game? Maybe THT is part of the problem not getting kessler involved enough? Again Jazz are experimental and not a championship team...</p>\n<p>Keyonte George, similar to THT he didn't shoot well 4-12, but still gave 7rebs, 6ast, 1stl to be useful in 27 mins. Probably should be stashed in Roto format leagues.</p>\n<p>Sexton 14pts, 50% FG, 6-6FTM, 2rebs, 6ast. He might end up starting very soon...</p>\n<p>Kris Dunn had 3ast, 2stls in typical dunn fashion, but little else. Keep on eye on him as a steals streamer (and sorta ast) all season. Plus upside IF he is the one that wins out for starter minutes.</p>\n<p>Olynyk was alright again with 9pts on 80%, 6rebs, 3ast. Taking mins from kessler?</p>\n<p>Heat vs Timberwolves</p>\n<p>Well you don't play your superstar (Jimmy Butler) cuz he needs \"rest\" after 2 games how can you expect to win? Heat started Jovic (who actually looked good) and Jaquez Jr. Yup. Apparently K Love is hurt too? I don't believe that. NBA needs to step in and FINE THEM! Make me pretty angry. I knew I should have selected Scottie Barnes over Jimmy Butler in more leagues (and probably a trade many of you should do right now) in that 2nd round. (I actually did this in 2 leagues as it was a draft day debate for me cuz barnes fits my build immensely) Timberwolves annhilated them by 16pts shooting 51% to 40%.</p>\n<p>Anthony Edwards 19pts, 7-15FG, 3threes, 2rebs, 7ast. I love those 7ast, no steals or blocks tho?</p>\n<p>Towns, 12pts, 10rebs, 2ast, 1stl, only 1 turnover. Only 40% shooting. I think he can step up more scoring than this but I mean the twolves won with a balanced usage approach so can't really argue with it?</p>\n<p>Gobert 14pts on 7-9FG, 14rebs, 1ast, 1stl. No blocks are disappointing, but he is looking like the elite FG%, elite REBS type of guy he always has been. I ponder a trade like Kessler for Gobert? Hmmmm...</p>\n<p>Mike Conley 14pts on 60%, 2threes, 4rebs, 5ast, 1stl. Good game from the underrated guy who sometimes went undrafted. He needs to be rostered folks. He is surrounded by weapons while himself being a \"weapon\" at times too.</p>\n<p>Naz Reid 25pts, 4threes, 8rebs, 1ast, 2stls. He shot 71%. Is that going to continue? No. But the rebs, the threes are a \"normalish\" part of his game/upside. Lots and lots of managers will chase this game expecting similar, but it's far more likely he gets around 20 mins and all of his numbers come down. (lots of garbage time blowout minutes) Still he is relevant and worthy add mostly as trade value. He was a +30 on the court!!! INCREDIBLE. So not only a good fantasy player, but good NBA player. If there was an injury to one of the twin towers (gobert or towns) he would skyrocket in value. I think more than anything tho you can use this to sell high for a more valuable longer term asset. (People do overreact and have a whole lot of recency bias to a huge game) There will inevitably be some clowns who drop Kessler for Naz Reid. What do you with them is (1. buy them some makeup for halloween) and then target them for trades rest of season. Always be taking notes on opponents tendencies. (fantasy commandment). A manager who dumps top, but temporarily struggling players will likely devalue their players in future slumps so technically \"all of their players\" are up for grabs in future.</p>\n<p>Kyle Anderson just continues to prove time and time again to be valuable, 12pts 5-6FG, 2rebs, 4ast, 2stl. Somehow only 42% rostered on yahoo. Very well rounded game now averaging 53% shooting, 5.5rebs, 4.5ast, 2stls on the season.</p>\n<p>For Heat</p>\n<p>Bam Adebayo 19pts, 7-14FG, 5-10FTM, eek, 3rebs, 2ast, 4 turnovers. Kind of a mid to bad game for him. Don't panic tho unless he continues to get tiny rebs in more games.</p>\n<p>Tyler Herro 22pts onbad 8-23FG, 4threes, 5rebs, 4ast, 0turnovers. Despite the bad shooting still a good game. You don't own Herro for his FG%.</p>\n<p>Jovic got the start and provided 8pts on 50% FG, 2threes, 11rebs, 4ast, 1stl. For a big to get 4ast is intriguing as well his huge rebs. I still think K Love is the likely starter going forward depending if that injury is actually a real injury? Assuming it is Jovic needs to be added if you need REBS. How long are the heat going to remain starting K Love EVEN IF he is healthy? This game appears to show the UPSIDE of Jovic and it's fairly exciting.</p>\n<p>Kyle Lowry still useful 7ast, 4rebs despite bad shooting and 4 turnovers. The key I think are his minutes are still huge at 32. Ahtough usage is low here again. Still probably a fringe player and more of an ast stream as season goes along. He does have the upside to have big games tho (proven over his history) considering his minutes have been high so don't be shocked if he goes off once in a while. I think \"upside streamer\" type? I realize that might be controversial cuz some feel he is washed (and he is hated around fantasy community). I'm not giving up any major assets to obtain him tho (obviously), but if he is a \"throw in\" in a trade that something moderately useful as opposed to another bad/droppable player. Mostly a streamer tho. 27% rostered  on yahoo currently.</p>\n<p>Dru Smith with 4ast, 1stl sorta might be an ast stream to watch.</p>\n<p>76ers vs Raptors</p>\n<p>PHI gets the win and as is usually the case for winning teams they shot significantly better as well as kept turnovers down to only 9.</p>\n<p>Joel Embiid legendary near trouble 34pts, 14-21FG (that extra volume really helps), 5-6 or 83% from the line, 9rebs, 8ast, 1stl, 2blocks, only 1 turnover (extremely good with that high usage).  Hold and Enjoy. With No harden it boosts him.</p>\n<p>Maxey 34pts, 12-20FG, 7threes, 100% FTM, 6rebs, 7ast, 1block. Draft day steal is proving to be far better than his ADP. Buy him if you can as I think he should continue this with harden mess. (maybe not this good of shooting, but still) He got a huge 41mins here too! If harden returns it likely will hurt his value some... IF IF...</p>\n<p>Tobias Harris 15pts, 2rebs, 2ast, 2stl, 2blocks. Classic typical line from him. Gotta like it overall and again saw 36 big mins. Same thing applies, as long as no harden his value rises.</p>\n<p>DeAnthony Melton 2pts, (1-7) 5rebs, 4ast, 1stl, 1blck. I think people will panic on this but you shouldn't. He still gave some counting stats and the minutes were there just struggled with shot. He isn't going to be this bad. You own him mostly for his threes and defense anyway not his PTS scoring. (if you are expecting more pts from him you might need to re assess your team build style/synergy/chemistry)</p>\n<p>Kelly Oubre Jr 18pts, 7-17FG, 80% FTM, 5rebs, 2ast, 3stl. This is the 6th man really worth rostering on this team. The steals are not an aberration for him either. He likely holds top 100ish value all season (maybe higher). But his current rank is 26. So based on that he has to be a sell high. People might give you far better more stable players than he is.</p>\n<p>Pat Beverley got 2ast and 5rebs from the guard spot on a back to back. He didn't hurt you shooting 2pts, 1-2. Just want to notate that as an advice for future, cuz he plays again Sunday and might add on more rebs. Thereby making it a unique play for \"out of position\" stats and as a \"desperation rebound stream\" IF you have extra adds and extra spots to be able to perform that stunt (some weeks this might occur). (Like for instance only a guard spot is \"empty\" on your roster for that day/next day and you need rebs in your matchup, he would be someone to consider as an option. Hope that makes sense? He typically provides some defense too so that's what I mean by streaming useful. (I almost streamed him in for the SAT/SUN back to back) I debated deleting or even writing about beverley, but there are useful tidbits in this paragraph.</p>\n<p>For Raptors</p>\n<p>Scottie Barnes 24pts 11-16FG, 8rebs, 5ast, 2blocks, 1turnover. (somehow 2threes as well) Not known for being a 3 point shooter. Value keeps going up and up. Of course no OG here helped him do more, but that shooting can't continue that high? Even still he contributes ALL OVER THE PLACE. He may return 2nd round value all season IF he shoots threes well. I believe he is a buy. You will want to have scottie barnes. Even if you overpay it might be worth it. His only real downside is FT%.</p>\n<p>Dennis Schroeder 15pts, 35% shooting, 4threes, 4rebs, 10ast, 2stl. Another guy underrated at draft. Hold.</p>\n<p>Poetl 6pts, 7rebs, 3ast, 1block. It's again worrisome cuz apparently he is losing time to precious achiuwa?!? What on earth is the coach doing?!? Nick Nurse would have played Poeltl 35 mins!? don't panic yet tho. Still hold. Might even be buy super low?</p>\n<p>Gary Trent Jr with increased usage with no OG, still did what he usually does. Score, hit some threes, get a steal. 17pts, 3threes, 2rebs, 1stl.</p>\n<p>Precious Aichuwa again with 7rebs, but only shot 30% on 10 shots so he helps yet hurts you (never been a high FG% guy). RebsStream</p>\n<p>Grady Dick 16pts, 4threes. most of his playing time came because of the OG injury. (GTJ slides in as starter, Dick gets the 6th man role) Nice to see him do well, but it's PTS/THREES main cats he provides it would seem? (that's his scouting profile) Don't be chasing this unless OG is out longer?</p>\n<p>Pacers vs Cavs</p>\n<p>Pacers win by a 12 point margin against a cavs team that is injured all over. A miniscule remarkable 7 turnovers for pacers!! (neither team playing defense? Cavs also only had 6 turnovers).</p>\n<p>Haliburton 21pts, 7-16FG, 4threes, 100% FTM, 8rebs, 13ast, ONE TURNOVER. An assist to turnover ratio of 13! The best point guard in the game ladies and gentlemen! HOLD HOLD HOLD TIGHTLY.</p>\n<p>Myles Turner continues to be very very good this season 20pts, 7-14FG, 100% FTM, 12rebs, 1ast, 2blocks. He contributes in 5 categories! FG%, FT%, PTS, REBS, BLOCKS. I think this another guy you want to have on your teams especially with haliburton at helm.</p>\n<p>Bruce Brown 6pts, 4rebs, 2ast, 1stl. Bad game, but not a drop yet. Still had 32mins.</p>\n<p>Mathurin 13pts, 1ast. Well we are back to square one with Mathurin only scoring points. Only 17 mins for him as Nesmith outplayed him. I wouldn't completely but wouldn't fault you if you moved on either?</p>\n<p>Aaron Nesmith 26pts, 10-16FG, 5threes, 9rebs. You don't chase this game. You don't get credit for the stats AFTER you add a guy. You need to predict great games BEFORE they occur not react to games AFTER they occur especially if they are unlikely to continue. I just don't think he is going to get this hot again. Good for him though. He is best considered as streamer, but something to monitor IF IF he continues to do this more often, then it would have my attention. We saw this from last year a few times. It looks like McConnell and Hield and Nembhard were all setting him up very well (16ast from them combined) in addition to some ast from haliburton. One thing rookie fantasy managers like to do is overvalue points scoring though so you could use this as \"trade bait\" to dangle the cookie into a lesser skilled manager in your league who might give up a better asset that either fits your build or team needs. But he should not be viewed as a long term option.</p>\n<p>TJ McConnell as ast streamer had 8 of them here and didn't hurt you with 60% shooting on a few points. Also of note is the zero turnovers. (one of the better passers in the game) This is his upside as a passer. I'm curious that Nembhard also got a bunch of mins. The \"main backup PG\" isn't set on who it is and really both might be relevant at times this season.</p>\n<p>Jalen Smith a helpful 13pts, great (5-7) 6rebs, 3ast.</p>\n<p>For Cavs:</p>\n<p>Evan Mobley filled it up! 33pts, 12/22FG, 80% FTM on 8/10, 14rebs, 3ast, 3blocks. HOLD and enjoy. As long as Jarret Allen out (and with  no mitchell and no garland) he just beasted and feasted!!</p>\n<p>Okorro 11pts, 5rebs, 3ast, 1blck is worth a mention.</p>\n<p>Caris Levert 31pts, 12-28FG, 4threes, only 33% FTM, 5rebs, 8ast, 1stl. He has got to be added after this. Holds value as a 6th man when dudes are healthy, but when they are out we see his upside (especially in a punt FT% build). You sell as high as you can on him though cuz can we expect more games like this? ONCE OR IF Mitchell and Garland are back? But the key word is IF healthy so based on that he needs to be scooped up. Only 26% rostered? Far too low. Scoop him folks. He should be held as long as they are out and then traded/flipped once/if/when they are healthy. He typically will harm your FG% tho.</p>\n<p>Max Strus 21pts, 4threes, 11rebs, 6ast. Similar to levert, he has upside CLEARLY with all these injuries. Looks at those rebounds and ast! Especially rebs now averaging 9.5 on season. The question is who will be the one to remain in the starting lineup when all them are healthy? I do think that answer is Strus. Such a massive jump from last year to this year many people would declare \"sell high\", but I'm not so certain... The dude is a hustler... I heard he was constantly training and in the weight room this offseason too (and he practices hardcore) so these big rebounds are a likely result of that extra muscle and tenacity/drive...</p>\n<p>Knicks vs Pelicans</p>\n<p>36% is what the knicks shot. TERRIBLE. Can't win a ball game shooting like that, plus 18 turnovers. Yuck. Julius Randle big reason for that with 8. This might be controversial to knicks fans, but I think Julius is a problem and they lose because of him. From his bad shooting, to his high turnovers, to his poor free throws and his lack of defense. He is just completely overrated as a basketball player and as a fantasy player. (-11 as well) If Knicks trade him away they instantly become better. I truly believe that.</p>\n<p>Julius Randle 10pts, 12rebs, 4ast, 4-15 FG. Refer to what I said above. He did hit 2/2FTM. Small clap. And the PTS, REBS, AST do paly well in PTS leagues. He is a vastly different player in PTS vs CATS leagues. Terrible in CATS, darn near elite in PTS. The fact that remains a thing makes me question the validity of the scoring in PTS leagues? Since how well they perform in NBA should be reflected as to how good they are in fantasy (but that's a whole other conversation). Are standard points leagues overvaluing PTS, REBS and AST? Hmmm</p>\n<p>RJ Barrett 18pts, (7/16) 3rebs, 2ast, 1blck, typical RJ Barret fashion mostly scored points and not much else. Similar to Randle he is not that good of a category league player. (PTS leagues different story)</p>\n<p>Jalen Brunson 14pts, 4/14FG, 5/6FTM, 4rebs, 5ast, only one turnover. Not a terrible game other than bad shooting. What made me shy away from brunson at draft too was lack of defensive stats and we see here also none.</p>\n<p>Mitchell Robinson. He can play all the defense for the team right? lol (and he kind of can). 8pts, 50% FG, 15rebs, 1stl, 2blocks. Another huge game for him especially for those who punt points.</p>\n<p>Josh Hart 10rebs, but shot only 20%. 2ast, 1stl. He is starting to feel like an iffy fringe player? I did have to cut him in a league, but may look to re add him cuz big rebs from the guard spot are rare. Which is THIS GUY as a meme. Not Patrick Beverly, but JOSH HART. Anywho...</p>\n<p>Divincenzo with 4rebs, 2steals, keep in mind as streamer.</p>\n<p>For Pelicans</p>\n<p>Zion 24pts, 12/17 FG, (wow) only 5rebs, 2ast, 1stl. Exactly what you drafted him for. The lower rebs and ast are not ideal tho. Again one of those weird situations where \"better in a pts league\" type of thing.</p>\n<p>Ingram 26pts, 11/17 FG (wow), 7rebs, 3ast, 1stl, but did have 5 bad turnovers. An asset like ingram is the kind of player I refer to when I talk about selling high on other guys. People still think he is \"injury prone\" and love to hate on him regardless of a big game. His \"market value\" is lower than his stat value. And his high turnovers also decrease his \"rank\"/stat value. It is alarmingly high with 5 in each of his games now, but if you punt that you care less about it.</p>\n<p>Herb Jones 10pts, 3blocks. This is why you roster him. Yup. If you punt PTS or AST those teams really love herb jones.</p>\n<p>Jonas V 8pts, 4rebs. I think the pelicans were way ahead so don't make too much of this. Should \"rebound\" next game. (pun intended).</p>\n<p>CJ McCollum 12pts on bad shooting 4-11, 50% from line, 3rebs, but helped extra with 7ast, 4stls. A fine line despite shooting bad. Hold.</p>\n<p>Larry Nance Jr. 0pts, 6rebs, 1blck (desperation rebs streamer)</p>\n<p>Dyson Daniels I'm going to mention with 4rebs, 3ast, 1stl in 22 minutes despite terrible 1/7 shooting. He is the current backup PG and should be for the next 3 weeks or so with alvarado out. Keep an eye on and use for streaming maybe?</p>\n<p>Grizzlies vs Wizards</p>\n<p>Well well what a shocker Grizzlies lose their 3rd game in a row... Bit of an upset too against Wizards who mostly won this game because of a few less turnovers and less fouls. That's what stands out.</p>\n<p>Desmond Bane got back on track with 26pts, 10/20FG, 4threes, 2rebs, 5ast, 1stl, 1block, however 5 turnovers. I expected him to shine early on in season with no JA. Keep holding cuz even bigger games are ahead...</p>\n<p>Jackson Jr 16pts, 4/12FG, 2threes, 100% FTM, 5rebs, 2ast, 1stl, 1blck. 33% and 5rebs from a starting PF? Eek. (one of the reasons I didn't particular like him at his ADP, but he still fits some punting FG%, REBS, builds) There are still some good things to like here, but yeah this is simply a bad game. Don't panic tho.</p>\n<p>Xavier Tillman 8pts, 7rebs, 3ast. The low usage and lack of defensive stats are noticeable, (plus only 24mins? must have been foul trouble?) but you continue to hold. Too much rebs/ast/stl upside.</p>\n<p>Marcus Smart 9pts, 50% FG, 4rebs, 6ast, 2stls, 2blcks. Defensive player of the year proving WHY he is valuable right here! He isn't going to be a major scorer though folks (you likely knew that).</p>\n<p>Zaire Williams 16pts, (6/14), 4threes, 10rebs, 1ast. Whoa. Big time rebs from a SF. He is the current guy getting mins at SF. I do not know if that will continue, but he is at least doing one thing ELITE (reb) so that likely remains him as the starter? In 2 games tho we have seen no defensive stats so that's a concern hindering his upside? Also he shot terrible last game. So jury is still out on what type of player he is/will be sorta...</p>\n<p>David Roddy 14pts, 3threes, 6rebs, 2ast, 1block. I wonder if this can continue? (I want to see more before adding)</p>\n<p>John Konchar 5pts, (2/4FG), 9rebs, 1ast, 2stl, 2blocks. Dude appears to be a great defender. (we saw this last year with him too in some stretches). REBS, STLS, BLOCKS in 2 games are alarmingly high. Only 2 percent rostered. He isn't scoring you points, but if at some point Williams struggles at SF it's possible Konchar steps in there? And even if not it appears he is quality 6th man. He isn't going to score many points (never has been), but yeah some defense and rebounding appeal here. For those about to punt I salute you.</p>\n<p>Derrick Rose wtih 7pts, 5ast, 1stl, 1blck. An ast streamer mostly.</p>\n<p>For Wizards</p>\n<p>Jordan Poole 27pts, (8-23) yuck, 4threes, 77% FTM, 4rebs, 2ast, 1stl, 1block, 5 bad turnovers. Hey if you design a team with Poole, Randle, Kuzma, RJ Barret, Westbrook you would be an elite PTS league team, but a terrible category league team. LOL. This is going to be the kind of games Poole does plenty of (although higher FTM). Like I was saying preseason I think he fits punt FG%, punt Turnovers type of builds. Load up on the small man stats and then find a 5th category to win. But yeah it helped wizards win so it can't be all that bad entirely. I still think he returns around top 40ish to 60ish value (depending on how many turnovers and how many ast he has)</p>\n<p>Kyle Kuzma 21pts, (9/23FG), 66% FTM, 13rebs, 2ast, 1stl, and amazingly zero turnovers. Credit to him for a great game. This is the sort of upside he has albeit hurting your FG%. His rank will fly up if he keeps those turnovers low. Do I think he will? nah history says no. (jeez last game he had zero turnovers too, interesting development) Hmmm.</p>\n<p>Tyus Jones 14pts, (41% FG), 4threes, 2rebs, 7ast, 2stl, 0turnovers. Tyus will have MANY more games EXACTLY like this. This is the Tyus Jones special!!! (well maybe the threes are a bit high), but yup high ast with low turnovers and contributes elsewhere. Underrated darling!</p>\n<p>Dan Gafford 10pts, 75% FG, 66% FTM, 11rebs, 2blocks. Back in the saddle. Bounces back from bad last game. Still might be a buy low considering his last game? Someone recently dangled Gafford and Okongwu for my Tre Jones to me (I'm still debating it).</p>\n<p>Deni Avjija 10pts, 50%, 2threes, 6rebs, 2ast, 2stl. nice useful game but he isn't a big time scorer, will contribute elsewhere tho. (He also didn't hurt you with his shooting) Great defender, great passer, great rebounder. For those about to punt I salute you.</p>\n<p>Corey Kispert 22pts, (8/14) 5threes, 3rebs, 1ast. He got on fire. He is capable of this. I do think it's possible he sees time at starting SF instead of Deni Avjija, but either way Kispert will see extra playing time when he gets fire like this, however that just means you DON'T CHASE this game. Mostly a threes and pts sreamer when schedule dictates. No need to overeact to it unless (as mentioned before) you plan on targeting weaker managers for trades.</p>\n<p>Delon Wright 2pts, (0-3FG), 2/2FTM, 2rebs, 7ast, 2stl, 1blck. Good game.  He should  be rostered in some builds for his ability to get AST and STLS, but does hurt your FG%.</p>\n<p>Pistons vs Bulls</p>\n<p>Blowout loss for bulls because Pistons shot lights out 52%!</p>\n<p>Jalen Duren!!! 23pts, 9/11FG, 5/5 FTM, 15rebs, 5ast, 1stl, 2blcks. ELITE. He is literally looking like a FIRST ROUND TALENT. This doesn't shock me at all. I had him as one of my options on draft day, but never actually ended up with him, sad. Just keep on enjoying this. He is not a sell high. HOLD. Check out those 5ast too?!? And perfect from the line?!? My gosh!! All of the upside in the world is developing/showing itself right in front of us. Vucevic for Duren, yup get rid of Vuc. (doubt they accept tho) All kinds of other similar trade moves. For those about to trade I salute you! This is someone you WANT TO HAVE. Absolutely, like wow!</p>\n<p>Cade Cunningham. I started with Duren cuz Cade had 6 turnovers and I want to mention that first. It's an iffy negative that must be considered despite the huge game, 25pts, 9/19FG, 6/7FTM, 4rebs, 10ast. Still this is huge! Another guy to target in trades esp if you are punting turnovers.</p>\n<p>Ausar Thompson 9pts, 12rebs, 5ast, 1stl, 1blck displaying a versatile all around game as a defender, rebounder, playmaker! This is why he was on people's sleeper lists. (almost everyone). I'm shocked at how he elite he is rebounding thus far. That has to come down to a more normal number I would think? He is only shooting 26% in 3 games now tho, so there are clear downsides, turnovers also a bit high? He still could be a bit of a buy low for those who don't see beyond \"rank\" (he is only ranked 112) or if you are punting specific things (like PTS or FG%). If he somehow figures out his shot WATCH OUT. Upside TO THE MOON. Of course let's calm down the hype train, that remains an IF scenario. Factually right now he has weaknesses.</p>\n<p>Killian Hayes 4ast, 1stl. 6pts, 2threes. Only 23 mins?</p>\n<p>Isiah Stewart is slightly useful player in some builds... 14pts, (6/14FG), 9rebs. Not much defense here but for pts and rebs you can do worse. I do fear he lacks overall upside considering his lack of defense.</p>\n<p>Alec Burks continues to be the 6th man scoring option 18pts, 50% FG, 6threes, 2rebs, 1block. No sign his role changing so he can be rostered for those he need PTS and THREES and FT% (holy trinity of little men? Or is that PTS, THREES, AST? Debate in the comments)</p>\n<p>Marvin Bagley III 11pts, 6rebs a useful rebs stream at times this season.</p>\n<p>For the Bulls:</p>\n<p>Zachary Thomas Lavine! Holy Macaroni! 51pts on 19/33, (57%) 75% from the line (iffy), 7threes, 4rebs, 1stl, 4 turnovers. (controversial comment alert) Well on second look it's a massive scoring night, but he didn't do much else and did have 4 turnovers? Still can't take this away from him and it's great! FG%, PTS, THREES, are those main THREE categories that THIS particular game boosts you in. (75% from line isn't that great) That's kind of what I mean by he didn't do much else? The strongest fantasy performers in a category league boost you in 4 or 5 sometimes even 6 categories, but those are SUPER RARE to have games with elite performances across the board like that and it typically happens with 1st or 2nd or 3rd round players more than others.... Still this big scoring game was nice huge bounce back game from when he struggled massively in last one. Because of the overall things I have mentioned though I do think he is a sell high. Plenty often the usage will fluctuate between him and Demar DeRozan. You hold in a PTS league (cuz again that style of paly favors PTS enormously).</p>\n<p>DeRozan 20pts, 7/13FG, 85% FTM, 2rebs, 4ast, 1stl, 2blocks, only 1 turnover. Carry on with your usual self sir. Typical mid range master. The steal and 2 blocks are a nice little bonus here!</p>\n<p>Vucevic 12pts, 4rebs (4 only?), 1ast. Can you do more please? Yikes.</p>\n<p>Coby White 0pts, 0/4, 2rebs, 1ast. Yikes. I don't think you need to hold, but then again he very well could bounce back with a nice game in the next one. In his defense you don't shoot the ball when Lavine is on fire like he was so that explain the tiny usage of 4 shots. (why I say the best dude for this offense was lonzo ball darn it, still sad he got hurt, he was a great passer to those high usage good shooters!) Coby is not that great of a passer, prob good/moderate. Also is now 27% FG on the season. Can't get married (can drop) to fringe players like Coby White folks...</p>\n<p>Andre Drummond per minute production real nice in punt PTS builds, 5rebs, 2ast, 3stl, 1block in only 14 mins, but did struggle shooting 1/6.</p>\n<p>Alex Caruso, 2pts on 50%FG, 5rebs, 4ast, 4steals, 1blocks. He should  be rostered for his ELITE defense and is \"must roster\" IF IF you are punting PTS. I do ponder if Caruso/White is a positional battle? He helps you right now in 4 categories: AST, STL, BLOCK, TO and technically doesn't hurt you in FG%, *chefs kiss* so THAT ladies and gentlemen is how you COOK fantasy wins IF punting pts.</p>\n<p>----</p>\n<p>Now if you want a condensed version just copy/paste sections into Chat GPT... (It was too long and chat gpt couldn't properly condense all of it, plus to be honest I don't truly like it condensed?)</p>\n<p>-----</p>\n<p>I'm aware that most of this is just the stats. But I think that's important because some/many fantasy managers lack a basic awareness of the facts/stats (especially for players we do not own) So it's good to remind ourselves of what those are! I tried to add a few extra things other than just the stats. I know it might be \"too wordy\"? Trying to get better at this without being too robotic/boring or tough to read...</p>\n<p>What are YOUR takeaways. Things you noticed when you watched the games or disagree with some of the things I have said? I don't want this to just be \"my takeaways\", I'd like for some of you to add on please!

            "content_html": "<caption>Open: <a href='apollo://www.reddit.com/r/fantasybball/comments/17j0m0x/pascal_not_so_spicy_p_siakim/'>Apollo</a> | <a href='https://reddit.com/r/fantasybball/comments/17j0m0x/pascal_not_so_spicy_p_siakim/'>Reddit</a></caption><div><br></div><p>If you\u2019re like me and were hoping Pascal would come out the gates spicy (ok, I\u2019ll stop lol), you\u2019ve been a bit disappointed. Tried to catch some of the game and did some research too. Here\u2019s what I got:</p>\n<p>The stats part:</p>\n<p>In the first 3 games, Pascal has averaged 14.7pts, 7.3 rebs, 4 ast, .3 blks, .3 stls on 37.5% fg%, 40% 3% and 72.7% from the FT line. So what\u2019s going on.</p>\n<p>His rebounds are very similar to his avg over the past 3 years (7.8 avg rebs), while his avg assists of 4 are down by about 1 assist per game (5.2 avg ast per game over the past 3 years). As steals and blocks can vary dramatically over a short period of time, I didn\u2019t look at that too heavily, but they are down a little bit compared to the past 3 year avgs of 1.1 steals and .6 blocks. </p>\n<p>This is the not so spicy part. Currently his PPG of 14.7 is down significantly compared to the past 3 year (21.4pts, 22.8pts, and 24.2pts per game) from 20-21 season through 22-23 season, respectively. This is partially due to his fg% dropping this year to 37.5% from his of average of 47.6% across the past 3 years I noted above.</p>\n<p>Well, is Pascal still taking the same amount of shots this year, you may ask? In the first 2 games, Pascal still averaged 16 FGA, which is comparable to his average FGA across the past 3 seasons of 17.8 FGA. Although, the 3rd game is a bit of an outlier as he only took 8 shots. So kinda. (Did wanna note that the 2nd game went into overtime and Pascal did take 1 shot that he missed, so that OT period did not effect his average FGA above dramatically)</p>\n<p>His FTs are also a bit out of wack. As he is shooting 72.7% from the strip this year compared to his 3 year avg of 78.3%. His attempts at the line are also down, this year he\u2019s at 3.7 attempts, while in the past three years he averaged 5.9 attempts.</p>\n<p>Clearly, Pascal is in a bit of a slump. Assuming, the first two games, where he had 16 FGA is closer to realistic compared to the 8 shots in the 3rd game, Pascal has room to step back into his 20+ ppg avg. If he can raise his fg% back up and also increase his ft% and raise his ft attempts back up as well. Assuming the rest of his stats remain similar YOY.</p>\n<p>Ascension/hot streak of Scottie \u201cBugatti\u201d Barnes:</p>\n<p>After catching parts of the past 2 games, I gotta say, Scottie looks very good and extremely confident! Had to go back and watch some of his highlights from last year and I think he worked really hard in the offseason on his shooting form. And it looks like it\u2019s paying dividends as his turn around jumper/3pt shot look smooth! No more weird hitch/wonky release. Which has translated to increasing his fg% and 3pt % to 50% and 33% respectively. Add this to his usual ultra aggressive attacks to the rim/post ups with plenty of kick outs to open shooters when the double comes, makes him deadly from the inside out. Small sample size, but I definitely think Scottie\u2019s shooting form improved and he will seek to take more shots this year because of this.</p>\n<p>I say all that about Scottie because I think the ball will be in his hands even more this year then in previous years as he seems to be taking a leap on the offensive end. In turn, this could hurt Pascal\u2019s production over the season. It could also help Scottie spread the floor too when Pascal has the ball. Gotta see more games to really know for sure.</p>\n<p>New coach in town:</p>\n<p>Tbh, haven\u2019t watched a lotta Raptors games in the past few years, so not exactly sure how/if new coaching regime has changed things up, but this could also effect Pascal. If someone with more knowledge can comment below on this, I\u2019d appreciate it!</p>\n<p>Tl;Dr - Pascal is in a shooting slump and should improve, but if Scottie\u2019s new and improved shooting form is legit, could that take shots/offensive possessions away from Pascal or could this help space the floor for him, making a devastating one two punch of Spicy P and Scottie Bugatti? </p>\n<p>Let me know what you guys think!</p>",

(Without anyone else influencing me, this is straight from me and my initial thoughts)</p>\n<p>Clippers vs Jazz </p>\n<p>Bit of an upset win for the jazz as clippers looked fantastic in their first game. Clippers shot better FG% (53%), however Jazz shot 90% from the free throw line which was likely the big difference. Let's take a look at the players. </p>\n<p>Covington, tiny usage, but did have 2 steals. </p>\n<p>Paul George, 15-15 FTM!!! ELITE! Shot well FG close to 50% with 36pts, hit 3threes, 4rebs, 1ast. Not a shock he does this, we seen in his past. I guess few downside are he had low ast and no defensive stats (typically he will tho). </p>\n<p>Kawhi Leonard, refer to PG13. 25pts, 9rebs, 4threes, 5ast, 2stl and only 1 turnover! Technically more well rounded game than PG13. </p>\n<p>Zubacs, bit of a down game with only 6pts, 2rebs, 2blocks. Don't panic. </p>\n<p>Westbrook racked up boards. 9rebs, 4ast, 1stl, 1block, only 4pts and in recent years westbrook fashion 5 bad turnovers. (again he is better in a pts league) </p>\n<p>Powell contributed 20pts off bench on 70% shooting plus 100% from the line. </p>\n<p>Batum was helpful with big bench mins of 30 and scored 8pts, 2rebs, 3ast, 1stl, 3blocks. (you love that defense!) </p>\n<p>for the jazz: </p>\n<p>Lauri Markkanen did exactly what we expected from the 2nd rounder. 35pts on over 50% shooting, 100% FTM, 5threes, 12rebs, 3ast. </p>\n<p>John Collins had a nice double double 13pts, 12rebs, 1block, and 100% from the line. </p>\n<p>Walker Kessler is a bit of a concern. This is 2 games now that are less than stellar and kinda bad. 7pts, 4rebs and 1 three. (why are you shooting threes? hmmm to me that harms his high FG% value). I may try to put feelers out there in trades, but you don't want to sell on Kessler too darn low so... I'm a bit worried. Is John Collins stealing his rebounds? I do want to say \"don't panic, it's only 2 games\" but he is getting limited minutes too!!! (only 21 here). I'm sure he will be a big discussion in the comments or next few days. I'm very heavily invested in Kessler this year. So yeah... </p>\n<p>Jordan Clarkson shot bad, but had 13pts, 4rebs, 6ast, 1stl. Nice. </p>\n<p>Talen Horton Tucker again for the 2nd game in a row shot around 30%, but he still gave us nice point guard 8ast, 3rebs, 3stl, 1 block! Still a nice game for him! </p>\n<p>Olynyck was great off bench 5-6 FG, 100% from the line, 4rebs, 3ast, 1stl, 1block. if he continues to get 27 minutes I would be interested in him longer term but I mostly view him as a streamer. </p>\n<p>Sexton chipped in 13pts, but little else. </p>\n<p>Nets vs Mavs </p>\n<p>Another win for the mavs with luka magic doing incredible things! It's pretty clear he willed them into victory, so freaking special. </p>\n<p>Let's talk nets first. </p>\n<p>Claxton was out and instead of DayRon Sharpe (like some thought including me) in the lineup we saw Dorian Finney Smith get the start. (sharpe only saw 3 mins, yikes) Cam Johnson was also out and this catapulted Cam Thomas in starting lineup. </p>\n<p>Dorrian Finney Smith had a nice game with 12pts, 4threes, 7rebs, 3ast. Don't chase this game tho. This was due to injuries thrust him in there and much larger mins (32) then he normally would get. </p>\n<p>Bridges isn't truly living up to his draft position with a bit of a struggle game here going 6-17 FG, (but 100% from line), 4rebs, 3ast. no defensive stats. Might be time to sell on him, cuz it's possible that this is the Cam Thomas show. </p>\n<p>Cam Thomas just wonderful. Whoa... NOW he deservers your attention! 30pts, on 12-19 FG, perfect 100% FTM, 7rebs, 2ast, 1stl, 1blck. We have said he mostly scores, but he brought some EXTRA here today! Woo hoo! Wowza. He is a must add in 12 teams. For the very least of \"trade bait\". He had 45 percent usage in last game and again this is very high usage in this game! He could be the best add of the season! Upside for top 75 maybe even top 50 production (if tons of points). Gotta be rostered tho, just has to be. </p>\n<p>Dinwiddie had a great game here 23pts on 8-17FG, 6threes, 3rebs, 8ast. That will do! That's around a 3rd-4th round type production!! </p>\n<p>Ben Simmons again does exactly what he is known for! good shooting 5-8, 10pts, 10rebs, 8ast, 2stl, 2blocks. ATTA BOY! He has top 20-30 upside if he plays like THIS! (and we seen it in years past) </p>\n<p>Royce O'Neale huge mins off the bench (34) and put up a huge line of 11pts, 10rebs, 3threes, 3ast, 1stl. If IF IF he gets minutes like this it might continue, but considering the injuries I don't think it will continue, but bravo to him, don't overreact. </p>\n<p>For Dallas. </p>\n<p>Luka luka luka. Wow. 49pts, insane 16-25 FG (must be mostly layups just like last game?) (I have not yet watched the game or \"condensed game\". Also 8-10 FTM, 10rebs, 7ast. His usage might be SKY HIGH continually on this bad dalls supporting cast (other than kyrie)</p>\n<p>Kyrie Irving 17pts, 6-17FG, 100% FTM, 7rebs, 6ast. an ok game. </p>\n<p>Derrick Lively follows up his great first game with only 9pts but again super solid 100% shooting on 4 shots (probably dunks/lobs I reckon?). Disappointing only 2 rebs and 1 block. Only 17mins yet had zero fouls? Bit confusing? PLAY THE KID! If he doesn't get the mins it's clearly a downside for his value. I think you still hold him to wait and see cuz he still has upside IF IF IF he gets more playing time. </p>\n<p>Grant Williams only 5pts, 6rebs, not a must roster.</p>\n<p>Tim Hardaway Jr off bench with big mins (30) with his usual scoring 19pts but only 6-17 FG bit inefficient, but helped 100% FTM. If only he could be more like his father  who was elite elite in steals. I ponder why on earth didn't his dad teach him those theft skills? lol</p>\n<p>Dwight Powell appears poised again to be a FG% streamer this year as he hit 4-4, plus a steal. </p>\n<p>Josh Green is interesting as a defender. 3steals. He also had 28mins. </p>\n<p>Rockets vs Spurs. </p>\n<p>Overtime game so stats are a bit skewed/extra from that. Spurs eeked out the win despite shooting slightly less than rockets. </p>\n<p>Sengun is looking like a MINI JOKIC! 25pts, 14rebs, 7ast, 2stl, 1blck. This is the type of upside we all knew existed when you drafted him in the 5th round. He fit builds where you needed extra AST from the big man, but here he is doing EVERYTHING. Whoa. HOLD. Don't sell high. That new coach likely knows the potential he has. </p>\n<p>FVV 24pts, on 50% shooting, 8rebs, 12ast, monster game! (where was the Sochan defense?) </p>\n<p>Jalen Green 22pts on efficient 50% shooting?! (maybe he is improving?) 5rebs, 4ast to also help out more! I still don't buy it and would be possibly selling high on this game maybe? </p>\n<p>Dillon Brooks appears like he might be a draft day steal. 17pts, 2rebs, 2ast, 1stl and getting massive 39 mins. </p>\n<p>Jabari Smith Jr 13pts (but terrible 5-16), 9rebs, 1stl. </p>\n<p>Amen Thompson only 13 mins, but i suppose did have 3ast. </p>\n<p>For Spurs </p>\n<p>Wemby A concern I had preseason was how would his FG% come out and here he struggled kinda 7-19 (missed all six threes), but real strong 7-8 from the line. 21pts, 12rebs, 1ast, 2stl, 3blocks. Those defensive stats and overall line are just MARVELOUS! But I would caution his 4 turnovers. Still, overall amazing game! HOLD. HOLD. Far too much upside. But I guess you could entertain offers because his value just SKYROCKETED and someone might give you a first rounder for him.. for real! </p>\n<p>Devin Vassell continues to break out 25pts, 3rebs, 2ast. </p>\n<p>Keldon Johnson is doing more than just scoring. 4ast, 4rebs, 20pts and very efficient 8-14. On this offense he is quite clearly the 2nd or 3rd option. Gotta hold him and see how far he can improve? </p>\n<p>Jeremy Sochan as the point guard is working fine (considering SA won), nice game 14pts, 5rebs, 4ast, 2stl and 100% FTM (he has appeared to fix that part of his game?). Must roster! </p>\n<p>Zach Collins alarming huge game despite struggling with shot, 9pts, 6rebs, 8ast, 4stl. </p>\n<p>Cedi Osman deep league relevant 14pts on good shooting. </p>\n<p>Tre Jones huge 33mins 6pts, 6rebs, 8ast, 3steals, beautiful. HOLD HOLD HOLD. Exactly the type of thing you expected from his skill set. </p>\n<p>Branham might be an AST streamer as he got 9pts, 4ast here. </p>\n<p>Raptors vs Bulls</p>\n<p>Chicago squeaks out the win in overtime! I'm a bit shocked raptors even got to overtime considering they only shot 37%! Yikes! </p>\n<p>Scottie Barnes with the Triple Double! 22pts, 10rebs, 10ast, 2blocks. I selected him in the 2nd round the other day! LOVE THIS! I see no reason why this can't continue! Clearly his value skyrocketing right now. (7 blocks on the season from the SF spot? ELITE) </p>\n<p>Siakam 18pts, 8rebs, 2ast. You would like more ast, but good game. </p>\n<p>OG Anunoby 11pts, 3rebs, 2steals. No need to panic. </p>\n<p>Dennis Schroder 10pts, 2rebs, 10ast, only 2 turnovers. He is looking like he will get a whole lot of AST on this team! He did struggle shooting tho 3-11. </p>\n<p>Poeltl likely fouled out early thus only 19min and 8pts, 6rebs. bit of a worry. </p>\n<p>Precious Achiuwa again wtih a big rebs game with 9 here, but as is the case with him bad FG% (40%). Still could be useful rebs streamer for those who need it this weekend. </p>\n<p>Gary Trent Jr did exactly what you want from him. 16pts, 3threes, 5rebs, 2stl, plus 1ast. Huge 36 mins too... </p>\n<p>Chris Boucher helpful 10pts, 6rebs worth monitoring. </p>\n<p>For Bulls: </p>\n<p>Demar DeRozan just does what he does, score from midrange! (one of the best in game at it). 11-22 FG, 33pts, 4rebs, 3ast, and a rare 4steals, 1block! BALLING OUT! Bit worrisome 71% from the line tho which is not usual for him. For as high as his usage he only had 2 turnovers. THAT MATTERS. Lavine got hurt in this game so DeRozan could absolutely skyrocket higher (well more pts mostly) IF Lavine has to miss time. Probably helps White and Vucevic some too. </p>\n<p>Vucevic only shot 4-15 FG? ouch. For a big man? Bigger ouch. He still got 12rebs, 11pts, 1blck, 1ast so it isn't unbearable. </p>\n<p>Lavine just couldn't put the ball in the hole. 3-14 FG!? 8pts, 5rebs, 1ast, 1block for him. His value is so low right and then you add the injury? Yikes. Still be patient... unless someone blows you away with an offer? (Maybe put him on trade block and see who offers what) </p>\n<p>Coby White now this was real nice to see from him! (He is still available in some leagues). 17pts, 6rebs, 8ast, 1stl, 100% from line, but only 33% shooting which is to be expected from him. If you need AST or FT% you should look his direction. Very good long term add as well. </p>\n<p>Alex Caruso, HOW YA DOING BOY?!? He is on of my darlings... 13pts, 13rebs, 2ast, 2stl, 1block. You expect the defense, you really don't expect that kind of elite rebounding, but it is an interesting development in his game if this continues further with big rebounds. Don't expect it or overreact to it, however the 32 minutes  ARE interesting. It would seem he stepped in for those Lavine minutes. IF lavine is out longer Caruso could benefit, but again temper those expectations, mostly its defense with him. </p>\n<p>Torrey Craig slightly relevant for SF mid level rebs stream as he got 5 here plus a steal and a block. </p>\n<p>Thunder vs Cavs </p>\n<p>well well it appears OKC is absolutely legit! (not a huge shock) As they pick up a big win against favorite Cavs (however they didn't have Allen or Garland). Most common reason most teams win is they shoot better than opponent, and that's what happened here. </p>\n<p>Shai continues to prove first round value. 34pts on bonkers 15-26 FG (not bonkers considering he is a mid range master) 11rebs, 4ast, 5stl, 1block. Contributing all over the stat sheet. Just nutty! Hold and hold on tightly. He will be part of championship teams no doubt. </p>\n<p>Chet Holmgren. 16pts, 3threes, 13rebs, 2ast, 1stl, 7blocks. SEVEN. Wow. Also only 1 turnover (as if he needed an even better stat line) If you can flip kessler for holmgren I might do that right now. One is surging on a great team and one is struggling on a bad team. This is the kind of wild upside he has! </p>\n<p>Lou Dort somehow popped in 25pts on 9-13 FG. He gets hot like this from time to time. He could be a guy you add and sell high? He also gave 3threes, 6rebs, 2ast, 1stl, 1blck. </p>\n<p>Josh Giddey really struggled immensely shooting 1-8 for only 2pts, and also 3 turnovers, but still helped out with 6rebs, 6ast to salvage terrible game. Don't panic just yet, probably just an off game.  </p>\n<p>For Cavs </p>\n<p>Donavon Mitchell went nuts in usage and excellence! 43pts on over 50% shooting, 81% from the line, 4threes, 8rebs, 5ast, 3stl, 2blcks. HOLD. He could return first round value for as long as players are injured on this team and even after. </p>\n<p>Evan Mobley nice to see a huge game from him! 14pts, 15rebs, 3ast, 2blocks, but did shoot only 40%. With the injuries this should continue. </p>\n<p>Okoro continues to produce in 2 games now 10pts, 7rebs, 2ast, 2stl, 1block. He is more known for his defense, but this is interesting to monitor. </p>\n<p>Strus absolutely struggled with shot. 3-14 FG, but still helped out with 5rebs, 4ast, 2stl, 1block. You might still be able to sell high based on that 1st game? </p>\n<p>Levert is the clear 6th man and should be relevant all season mostly for PTS or AST, he only had 2ast here, but 17pts, 2rebs, 1stl, 1blck. </p>\n<p>Heat vs Celtics </p>\n<p>Celtics are just so incredibly good folks as they pickup their 2nd win. (their starters played huge minutes again) </p>\n<p>Bam Adebayo 27pts, 7rebs, 2ast, 1stl, 2blcks no worries. </p>\n<p>Tyler Herro 28pts on 50% shooting, 5threes, 6rebs, 6ast, 1stl. Herro continues to step forward as the main scoring threat and top playmaker on this team. </p>\n<p>Jimmy Butler struggles with this shot 3-11, but still hit 8-9 (88%) from the line as well as 5rebs, 3ast, 1stl, 1block. Don't panic. He is a star. </p>\n<p>Kevin Love 2 games in a row with big time rebs! 9 in this game, and 9pts, 2threes, 2ast, 1stl. I do think he is relevant for that stat, but monitor his mins as he only had 21 here. </p>\n<p>Kyle Lowry. I was just talking him up the other day. I know there is way too much negativity about him and some think he is washed. This game proves HE IS NOT. Very worthy 13pts on 5-7 FG, 3threes, 8rebs, 5ast, 1block and only 1 turnover. If you need ast this is a guy to add. He also had 32 mins... He is NOT washed. It's very possible he finishes around top 100-125, I would not be shocked if around top 75, but I think that's less likely. Buy him way low cuz his market value is miniscule (again so much negativity around him) </p>\n<p>Dru smith had 3threes and 3 steals and 3ast. useful. </p>\n<p>Duncan Robinson hit 3threes. (streamer for that) </p>\n<p>For Boston: </p>\n<p>Jayson Tatum his usual self 22pts, 8rebs, 5ast, 1stl. </p>\n<p>Kristaps another great game 17pts, 9rebs, 1ast, 3stl, 1block. </p>\n<p>Jrue Holiday rectifies bad first game with a near triple double! (I believe he will have many many great games ahead) 17pts, 10rebs, 7ast, 1block. If you can still buy low on Jrue I think that's the best play!! He will be a big part of this offense! It does appear celtics will paly their starters huge minutes. (2 games in we have seen that) </p>\n<p>Derrick White 28pts, 9-15 FG, 5threes, 6rebs, 3ast, 1stl, 3blocks. I don't know if he is a sell high or hold. I think I lean sell high, but on this offense he will still get good looks. </p>\n<p>Jaylen Brown 27pts, 50% shooting, 3threes, 6rebs, 1ast, 2stl but 4 turnovers. Great great game but the liability at FT% (2-4 here) and turnovers do pop up.  </p>\n<p>Al Horford got 25 bench minutes and helped 10rebs, 2ast, 1block. Inevitably people will add him. I guess he is fine at the end of your bench, but don't expect points (he had zero here) </p>\n<p>Knicks vs Hawks </p>\n<p>The knicks won this game because they hit 20threes in comparison to the 12 the hawks hit. Maybe the hawks aren't as good as we thought they are? </p>\n<p>Julius Randle just randled. 17pts, 12rebs, 9ast near triple double, but again in his fashion 40% FG and 75% from the line. (you gotta punt percentages when you have him). Also no defensive stats and 3 turnovers. Still a great game and real real nice in PTS leagues. </p>\n<p>Jalen Brunson what a game! 31pts, 8threes, over 50% FG, 3rebs, 5ast, 1 turnover. He got extremely hot. You can't reliably expect this kind of shooting, but hold and enjoy. </p>\n<p>RJ Barrett 26pts, 9-15 FG (ok, i see you), 3threes, 3rebs, 6ast, 1stl. I think you use this to sell high on him (esp in a category league). In PTS leagues just continue to deploy as normal. </p>\n<p>Mitchell Robinson HOW YA DOING MAN!! And this was MANLY!!! ELITE DEFENSE. 4steals, 4 blocks, 13rebs!! Only 7pts (in his typical form) but interestingly only shot 2-6 (rarity). Robinson is special for his defense. (I am pretty heavily invested in him this year too). You might be able to snag him if you convince someone \"he doesn't score enough pts\" as some managers don't see beyond that. </p>\n<p>Quickly still holding value with 11pts, 6rebs, 6ast, 1stl despite not shooting well. </p>\n<p>For Atlanta </p>\n<p>DeAndre Hunter went nuts with 27pts, 6rebs, 1ast, 1block. 8-8 from the line. Is he going to shoot 8-13 every game? No. So I see this as mostly an aberration. Do NOT chase it. It's interesting and worth monitoring. </p>\n<p>Trae Young still struggling with his shot 4-16. I believe you kinda need to punt FG% if you own him, (and turnovers as he had 6 here, OUCH), but still does other good thing like shooting 80% 8-10 FTM and 12ast and 3steals. He might be a bit of a buy low considering his FG%, but then again I\"m not really \"extremely high on him\" either considering his liabilities (unless you wish to transform your team into that punt build). </p>\n<p>Dejounte Murry bounced back here shooting close to 50% on 18pts, 7rebs, 6ast, 1stl, 1block. Let's hope that continues. He is pretty proven so I reckon it should. </p>\n<p>Clint Capela. Yet again we see elite rebs. 13 of them with 13pts, 2ast, 1block. There still exists significant negativity around him so you might be able to buy him low despite 2 great games from him. He is another guy I might target to trade away Kessler (maybe). There is nothing that should scare you away from Capela really. And Okongwu again was at 20 mins only. This is Capelas job through and through, HOWEVER I might add that hawks are 0-2 so maybe maybe they change things up? (those changes might come in other place tho?) Also if they continue to lose it might be reason to \"develop Okongwu\" and trade away Capela. I don't know... </p>\n<p>Jalen Johnson has to be rostered in most cases. 11pts, (5-8) 9rebs, 2ast, 1stl, 1block. There is some upside here and getting the minutes. Others have mentioned this while I have been a bit more \"wait and see\". Two games now we see him getting huge mins (30) and performing just fine (around top 50-75). If there is one downside to his game it is he isn't an elite/great three point shooter, but otherwise plenty of all around talent! </p>\n<p>Bogdanovic relevant 4threes, 16pts, 3ast, 1stl. </p>\n<p>Nuggets vs Grizzlies </p>\n<p>\"He who shoots better usually wins\" and boom Nuggets shot better. Not a shock the champions scooped up a win against depleted grizzlies and now they fall to 0-2. I must bring THIS up: What if grizzlies continue to lose too many games and then decide they just won't bring Ja Morant back as they purposefully tank? Hmmm... I'm just tossing it out there... It's also possible if they are that far back if lights a stronger fire under Ja Morant to play harder/better... So you can look at it both ways? </p>\n<p>Jokic didn't get a triple double. What a bum. You can drop him now. LOL. Nah just kidding, HOWEVER I will declare an incredibly terrible stat Jokic did have: NINE TURNOVERS. Nine. That likely loses you the category. Eek. Don't panic tho folks, if anything try to \"buy low\" on him if you can for someone who does freak out about that? (there is a case to be made that if you own Jokic you are punting turnovers anyway). If you are trying to win turnovers with Jokic you are doing it wrong. He had 22pts, 12rebs, 7ast, 1stl, 1blck. </p>\n<p>Jamal Murray still great, 22pts, 4threes, 100% FTM, 1rebs, 5ast, 1block. </p>\n<p>MPJ is showing us some big time rebs! He had 13 here, plus 9pts, 3ast. If you need rebs it seems he could be a target especially from the SF spot. </p>\n<p>KCP really bringing the defense this year! 5 steals and a block! struggled shooting at 30%, but yeah real nice. Hold and enjoy top 75ish value all season. </p>\n<p>Aaron Gordon still was efficient and good with 10pts, 2rebs, 3ast, 3stls, 1block. Based on his draft position I still think he is a buy low. </p>\n<p>The nuggets bench showed up this time... </p>\n<p>Reggie Jackson 16pts, (7-13), 2rebs, 6ast, 1block. I mostly see him as an AST or PTS streamer, not entirely a must roster, but he very well could be on certain teams. </p>\n<p>Peyton Watson out of position blocks from a guard where he got 3blocks, plus 9pts, 2threes, 3rebs, 1steal. If you need defense or this is a specific part of your build maybe give him a look, but I think this is a \"monitor\" situation first... </p>\n<p>For Grizzlies: </p>\n<p>Marcus Smart 20pts (7-13 FG), 100% FT, 2rebs, 5ast, 5steals. FIVE. As long as No Ja Morant his value will remain high. Nice to see him shoot so well as he typically doesn't. </p>\n<p>Jaren Jackson Jr 21pts (9-13FG), 9rebs, 2ast, 3blcks. The higher rebs and higher FG% are an interesting development if he can continue to do that.. </p>\n<p>Xavier Tillman 13pts, 8rebs, 2ast, 3stls, 2blocks. Your time to buy low is fading (well nonexistent). This dude now has 2 monster games! And I see zero signs that this will end. HOLD. HOLD. </p>\n<p>Desmond Bane 15pts on 4-17 is EEK. (don't panic). He still went 6-6 FTM and 3rebs, 3ast, 2stl. Should get back on track soon. I wonder if denver double teamed him? Opening up shots for Smart and JJJ? </p>\n<p>Zaire Williams only shot 30% but 5-5 FTM and 9rebs, 3ast (also 4 bad turnovers). I'm iffy if he should be added. I more so want to monitor but possibly he is streamworthy for those rebs? He did get 31 mins... </p>\n<p>Derrick Rose this time was the 6th man scorer this time 16pts, 4rebs, 3ast, 1stl. Interesting. </p>\n<p>Konchar with 30 big mins off bench, 2pts, 6rebs, 2ast, 1stl, 2blocks could be useful as a rebounder and blocks streamer from guard spot. </p>\n<p>Pistons vs Hornets </p>\n<p>Young exciting pistons get a win! The hornets just shot unbelievably bad hence the 12 points victory for DET. </p>\n<p>Jalen Duren 14pts, 17rebs, 3ast, 1stl, 2blocks. 7-8 FG!!! HUGE!!! It would be pretty hard to pry away Duren from anyone and if you do own him HOLD HOLD HOLD. Stud. Top 20-40 type talent right now. </p>\n<p>Cade Cunningham 12pts (4-13 FG), 2rebs, 6ast, 1stl, 5turnovers. Eek terrible game. But don't panic... </p>\n<p>Isiah Stewart 15pts, 7rebs, 1ast, 1block. pretty nice game. He will likely have many games similar to this one. </p>\n<p>Ausar Thompson 6pts, 13rebs, 6ast, 1block (shot 2-9). As you can see the huge upside he has for other stats while not being a major scorer. (fits specific punt builds) </p>\n<p>Alec Burks 24pts, 50% FG, 11-12 FTM, 4rebs, 2ast, 1stl, 1blck. Don't overreact and chase this game. Although he will be a pretty reliable bench scorer. You could use this to sell high tho? </p>\n<p>Jaden Ivey 18pts, 2rebs, 4ast, 1stl. An interesting 2nd year talent who should continue to get ast and a fair amount of points. </p>\n<p>Bagley III 14pts, 4rebs, 1ast. If you need points and a few rebs, mostly a streamer. </p>\n<p>For Hornets: </p>\n<p>Lamelo Ball almost a triple double 20pts, 9rebs, 9ast but didn't shoot great 4-17. (again often a punt FG% type when you own him). He was great from the line 10-12 and 2stl, 1blck. </p>\n<p>Mark Williams comes far far back down to earth (cuz of foul trouble) with only 2pts, 3rebs, 1ast. Don't panic. Should be just fine. If anything use this game to buy low. </p>\n<p>Terry Rozier 20pts, 3rebs, 1ast, 1stl. Only 1ast? Come on man, need more... but he still scored and he also 4-4 FTM. </p>\n<p>Gordon Hayward huge game 19pts, 9rebs, 4ast, 3stl. He is available in leagues still and I believe he should be rostered. He is the 2nd or 3rd scoring option on this team and does plenty extra stuff. </p>\n<p>PJ Washington pretty good 13pts, 3rebs, 3ast, 2stl, 1blck. </p>\n<p>Brandon Miller stepped in off bench and nice game 17pts, 6rebs, 2ast, 1stl, 1blck. If you need some pts and rebs from your SF he could be worth an add. I kind of want to wait n see tho? </p>\n<p>Nick Richards had 2 blocks and a steal. </p>\n<p>----</p>\n<p>Now if you want a condensed version just copy/paste into Chat GPT... It was too long and chat gpt skipped out on games... </p>\n<p>-----</p>\n<p>I'm aware that most of this is just the stats. But I think that's important because some/many fantasy managers lack a basic awareness of the facts/stats (especially for players we do not own) So it's good to remind ourselves of what those are! I tried to add a few extra things other than just the stats. I know it might be \"too wordy\"? Trying to get better at this without being too robotic/boring or tough to read... </p>\n<p>What are YOUR takeaways. Things you noticed when you watched the games or disagree with some of the things I have said? I don't want this to just be \"my takeaways\", I'd like for some of you to add on please!

That is how you lose leagues. Over the first 3-4 weeks of the season, you should not be making any drastic roster moves with your top guys. Any player can get off to a slow start. <strong>DO NOT PANIC</strong>. Anyone in the top 75 should be given time to revert back to normal. Do not fall victim to 'small sample size theater'.</p>\n<p>You should <strong>not be dropping any player</strong> who would be picked up immediately by someone else. You also should not be trading players that have a start slow. <strong>Selling Low is poor form</strong>. Here is what you should be looking for in the first two weeks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Exploit the Panic in Others</strong> - Others will panic; <strong>exploit them!</strong> Buy Low on their slow starts, grab their bad drops off of the waivers, trade the bottom half of your team for their top-half players. Fan the flames of panic and grab any asset you can. Having too many assets is never a problem.</li>\n<li><strong>Hit the Waivers HARD &amp; IMMEDIATELY</strong> - The end of your bench should always be expendable. Take a chance on hot players immediately. Pick them up during opening night games. <strong>Do not wait!</strong> You could be grabbing a top 50 player off waivers in the next 5 days. (Think Desmond Bane, Cam Johnson, Jalen Williams). At worst, you'll get a few good starts followed by some bad starts then drop that player for another hot hand. These are the moves that win leagues, don't hesitate to grab any hot hand off the waivers and replace your end-of-the-bench guys at will. <strong>Do not sit on your waiver priority, that is not important in most leagues!</strong> You should have a new player on your team by Fri. night.</li>\n<li><strong>Sell High, eventually...</strong> - Don't get too attached to hot starts from mid-tier, either. Certainly, there are going to be break-out players, and you have to do your best to evaluate if their hot starts are sustainable. (Are they young enough to make the leap? Are the mins real? Are they shooting way above their avgs? (high FG &amp; FT are not sustainable. Does the return of an injured player reduce their value?) There is always a trade that makes sense. 9 out of 10 times, an average player will revert to the mean. Take the time to evaluate your team. <strong>Wait</strong>. Give guys a few weeks of run under them, and then start to think of their value long-term. Trades are the path to a successful season.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/0BPh0NmKDlmpcwgDMAMKKJ?si=mgakccajRVeNocb9jrGZVw\">Check out the Watching the Boxes Podcast</a> for your week-to-week analysis, check out the new <a href=\"https://www.industrypickup.com/\">Industry Pickup League</a> or follow the WTB <a href=\"https://twitch.tv/watchingtheboxes\">Twitch Channel.</a>  Thanks for reading and welcome back!</p>",

It might not make any difference whatsoever if teams are ready to sit their players out to load manage for the playoffs (and obviously it wouldn't change players getting injured and being unable to play).</p>\n<p><strong>But</strong> I think we're actually underrating the effect it may have on this fantasy/award season and that it's something to watch out for</p>\n<p>Last season, out of the 15 players who made the All-NBA teams, 5 of them (33%) did not meet the 65 games qualifier:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Giannis (63g, only unanimous 1st team selection)</li>\n<li>Steph (56g, 2nd team)</li>\n<li>Jimmy Buckets (64g, 2nd team)</li>\n<li>Dame (58g, 3rd team)</li>\n<li>Bron (55g, 3rd team)</li>\n<li>Honorable mention: AD was at 56 games and just missed out, with people calling out his lack of availability</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On the defensive side, we had JJJ and Giannis who both played 63 games.</p>\n<p>In the 2021-22 season, we had players such as Ja, KD, Steph, Bron, Bam, RobWill, Dray make the All-NBA or All-Defense teams while missing the 65 game limit.</p>\n<p>What I think is that this new rule will indeed make a difference for multiple players this year. </p>\n<p>You can never account for injury, but I'm 99.9% sure that LeBron will play 65 games this season (maybe even exactly 65) if he has no major injury in order to make sure he makes the All-NBA team (and/or MVP conversation or whatever else he's a part of). Giannis, Jimmy would obviously have played 1-2 more games last year to guarantee their accolades. AD and Steph might have played a few more instead of resting as long as it's not sitting due to a real injury.</p>\n<p>I don't think someone like Kawhi would care enough where the Clips load manage him less just so he can qualify, but shit if Zion is nearing 60 somehow then he'll keep going to make sure he lands a spot on All-NBA. And I'm like sure sure on the LeBron thing.</p>\n<p>What do you guys think? Does this rule change anything at all for any players, or is it insignificant? And if it'll make a difference, who are some players to keep in mind?</p>",

This year....I have gotten a bit carried away. I am at 20 teams and counting and it's all starting to blur together.</p>\n<p>I knew I hit rock bottom last night when an hour into my $400 Auction draft my yahoo app buzzed.  I had a $250 snake draft starting in 10 minutes....  </p>\n<p>I had purchased two teams drafting at the same time.  </p>\n<p>No way to get my money back. No way to get out.  </p>\n<p>I did what any person would do and I recorded it and put it on youtube.</p>\n<p>My question to the community is this. Whats your craziest Draft story? Draft at work?

Man was an absolute beast last season and he didn't really hurt you anywhere. His FT was a bit low for a guard but certainly won't kill you. I've seen him go as late as the 6th round which feels insane given that the kings haven't meaningfully changed their roster. I don't see his role diminishing much.</p>",
