I beg to differ. So, Ayton goes from PHX to POR that means no more KD and Booker taking the shots, right? Well Simons shot it 19 times a game last season. Booker 20. Jerami Grant took just shy of 15 shots a game last year and now he has a huge contract and no Lillard usage. Expect that to be 17 or 18. You have Scoot coming in who will be sure to take more usage away along with Rookie pains. Sharpe is looking to emerge as a young star.  I just don't see from a points standpoint he gets any better. Rebounding is the only category I see him maybe taking a small leap in. He isnt a huge steals/blocks guy. So basically, you are looking at a small rebounding boost not to mention his prior work ethic rumors. That being said I am not swayed by the new team buzz. I don't see it much of a boost</p></div>",

Let's break down the instant fantasy takes.</p>\n<p>Fantasy WINNERS:</p>\n<p><strong>Dame Lillard</strong>: Dames value was falling the last few weeks as the possibility of a holdout loomed. You have to imagine the Bucks got some form of security from Dames camp that he would play. Dame is a first rounder when playing and he seems poised to lead a bucks offense and team that suddenly seems top heavy.</p>\n<p><strong>Deandre Ayton</strong>: He is going to get WAYYY more offensive opportunities on a trailblazers team that is in full rebuild mode. You would imagine the Blazers try and pump him and his stats up to make the Dame trade look better. There is a small chance he is retraded, but in our opinion its smaller than Jrue.</p>\n<p><strong>Grayson Allen:</strong> He is going to a super thin Suns team that has several players who could go down with an injury at any given time. Once Middleton came back last year Grayson fell off, but he has proven when given opportunity he can be fantasy relevent. The suns core should be drawing lots of doubles and creating open looks and Allen is a deadly catch and shoot player.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Fantasy Losers: </p>\n<p><strong>The Blazers</strong> Logjammed <strong>guards</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Jrue:</strong> Jrue now steps right into the limbo that Dame was in. He doesn't fit age wise in the direction the Trailblazers are going, and he could be rerouted before the deadline.</p>\n<p><strong>Simons &amp; Scoot:</strong> We thought they might have a clear path to the city (and they will still get a lot of touches even with Jrue) but now there are a firm 3 guards that need to play instead of the potential for 2 had the Dame trade brought back a wing and a big instead of a guard and a big. </p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Even value or not enough change to warrant a designation:</p>\n<p><strong>Nurk</strong> seems like a slight boost in value, but questions about his health remain the biggest hurdle, with as many great bigs as there are late in the draft I won't be reaching for him.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Who do you think won this trade?</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Link for our full reaction below</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/W0_yi5Ib9co?si=FMLlSNC5ytvdrwjt\">Trade Video</a></p></div>",
