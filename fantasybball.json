He's avging 26/6/9 on 46/86 shooting, 2 triples and 1 steal. Basically an improvement in every cat from last year aside from TOs. BBM has him as the 30th ranked player but if you punt TOs - which I think a lot of people do - he's actually the 9th ranked player this season. </p>\n<p>Is there a chance that he makes his way to the first round, top 12 next year? If so, who would he replace? I can see a lot of people opting for Cade over Tatum, given that Cade brings in those elite assists and his rebounds and scoring are pretty much just as good. I don't think a lot of people would be drafting Ant in the first round either. AD might fall as well given his injury concerns and the Mavs being broken and directionless. </p>\n<p>Thoughts?</p>",

If you punt TOs, in fact, Cade is the #10 ranked player this year per BBM.</p>\n<p>I got him at the end of the 3rd round and he honestly feels like a steal.

Adding these players are often the difference between winning your league and not, so getting a good feel for who has the highest upside to close out the season is almost mandatory for those with March playoff schedules. </p>\n<p>This article features the first five players from the list, with the second part likely dropping tomorrow to round out the list of valuable adds. Players highlighted here are Jonathan Mogbo (Raptors), Damion Baugh (Hornets), Jared Butler (76ers), Mo Gueye (Hawks), and Kyshawn George (Wizards). Inside the article is more reasoning behind why they were selected, potential upside they have, and their path to winning your league. </p>\n<p>Are there any other guys from these teams you are looking out for? I personally believe that the Hornets in particular are the team to keep an eye on, as they have to no heir apparent to absorb the load from LaMelo. </p>",

Keep in mind that each pick on the list is format specific, and the reasoning behind each pick is including in the article.</p>\n<p>As always, if you have any questions, feel free to ask! </p>",

For me I\u2019m already gonna call him a league winner cause he is simply him. But is he a shutdown risk , he\u2019s basically the first option now and with more usage due to dejounte being out , cj is being kinda washed and Zion missing games , it\u2019s all open for him , would love to know what you guys thinking about him?</p>",
