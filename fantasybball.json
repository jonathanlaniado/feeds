As someone who had the same feeling about Dejounte Murray before his breakout season on the spurs, I am comfortable with expecting Devin to smash his adp.</p>\n<p>An ADP of 108 on ESPN is an absolute joke and he almost a league winner at that cost. On yahoo 70.7 is more fair but im still expecting him to crack the top 50 in terms of value. </p>\n<p>He will be the spurs number one option on offense and im projecting him at about 22.5/4/4 with almost 2 steals per game. Devin's strongest cats are 3's and steals but also doesn't hurt you in anything except fg% on the off nights and also doesn't average too many turnovers.</p>\n<p>He has looked great in camp and just earned a new contract. Im expecting big things and drafting him everywhere I can and you should too. Anywhere past 70 is an absolute steal.</p>",

I watch the Bulls and feel like I got a few little tidbits of info.  No one has time to watch every teams entire media presser so I thought it would be cool for people to just post their own. \n\nBulls notes:\n\n**Billy Donovan and AK:**\n\n* AK has been emphasizing changing shot profile since the last season ended and has consistently mentioned it during the presser.  Bulls were among the last in 3PA so safe to assume they\u2019ll try to get more volume from somewhere.  Also mentioned increasing pace.\n\n* More interestingly Billy and AK indicated that they can\u2019t just launch shots.  They talked about changing how the offense is run.  Moving away from Demar and Lavine ISOs.  Meshes with what Vucevic says later in the presser about using him more as an offensive hub.\n\n* Billy said emphasis is to get the ball in the paint more to get more offensive rebounds and spray out 3s. \n\n* PG and PF positions are not set in stone and will be determined in training camp this week.  They are also willing to change it around mid season if they feel like other looks are working better.\n\n**Zach Lavine:**\n\n* Not much here aside from him being fully healthy and actually had an off season to train instead of rehab.  He expects to shoot more 3s.  He seems slightly annoyed about the trade rumors if you\u2019re the type of person who thinks that\u2019ll motivate him.\n\n**Demar Derozan:**\n\n* Demar actually indicated he needs to shoot more 3s and that he knows how it\u2019ll help his game.  This is kind of a big deal imo, I\u2019ve watched all his interviews and this is the first time he\u2019s actually admitted he has to adjust.  He usually defers and says he\u2019ll take 3s when they\u2019re given to him or within the flow, and he said some of that here, but I haven\u2019t heard him say that he needs to shoot more like this this plainly since he was traded here.\n\n* Made an offhand joke about joining the point guard battle.  Probably nothing, but maybe he was asked to facilitate more?\n\n**Nikola Vucevic:**\n\n* IMO the real juicy take away from the day.  Vucevic indicated part of him resigning was getting more touches in the paint.  Said Billy talked to him about utilizing him more as a hub for the offense and taking advantage of his playmaking. Denver and Jokic mentioned as a team among others that can look to for examples. Talked about having more actions with guards cutting to him.\n\n**Jevon Carter**\n\n* Not much, but talked about how Bulls seemed hesitant to shoot last year.  Excited and motivated to play for his home town.\n\n* Mentioned he feels like Bulls need a floor general to take pressure off Lavine and Demar. \n\n**Coby White**\n\n* Same as Jevon really.  Excited for the positional battle.\n\n* Said he continued this off season where he left off last year with working on his handles, finishing, becoming more of a complete player.\n\n* Said he wants to return a bit to his mindset as \u201chighschool coby.\u201d idk if that means he\u2019s embracing the scorer role as 6th man, but maybe something to keep in mind of you\u2019re deciding between him and carter late in the draft. \n\n**TLDR:** \nBulls as a whole are trying to increase pace, 3s, and fouls.  They are probably going to try to use Vucevic more as a passer. Demar will continue to try to shoot more 3s. Lavine is healthy. PG and PF positions are up in the air.<div><br></div><div><p>I know media day is mostly fluff, but you can gain some insight into how teams are looking to approach the season or where they are leaning towards in positional battles.

Meshes with what Vucevic says later in the presser about using him more as an offensive hub.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Billy said emphasis is to get the ball in the paint more to get more offensive rebounds and spray out 3s. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>PG and PF positions are not set in stone and will be determined in training camp this week.  They are also willing to change it around mid season if they feel like other looks are working better.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Zach Lavine:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Not much here aside from him being fully healthy and actually had an off season to train instead of rehab.  He expects to shoot more 3s.  He seems slightly annoyed about the trade rumors if you\u2019re the type of person who thinks that\u2019ll motivate him.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Demar Derozan:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Demar actually indicated he needs to shoot more 3s and that he knows how it\u2019ll help his game.  This is kind of a big deal imo, I\u2019ve watched all his interviews and this is the first time he\u2019s actually admitted he has to adjust.  He usually defers and says he\u2019ll take 3s when they\u2019re given to him or within the flow, and he said some of that here, but I haven\u2019t heard him say that he needs to shoot more like this this plainly since he was traded here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Made an offhand joke about joining the point guard battle.  Probably nothing, but maybe he was asked to facilitate more?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Nikola Vucevic:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>IMO the real juicy take away from the day.  Vucevic indicated part of him resigning was getting more touches in the paint.  Said Billy talked to him about utilizing him more as a hub for the offense and taking advantage of his playmaking. Denver and Jokic mentioned as a team among others that can look to for examples. Talked about having more actions with guards cutting to him.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Jevon Carter</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Not much, but talked about how Bulls seemed hesitant to shoot last year.  Excited and motivated to play for his home town.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Mentioned he feels like Bulls need a floor general to take pressure off Lavine and Demar. </p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Coby White</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Same as Jevon really.  Excited for the positional battle.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Said he continued this off season where he left off last year with working on his handles, finishing, becoming more of a complete player.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Said he wants to return a bit to his mindset as \u201chighschool coby.\u201d idk if that means he\u2019s embracing the scorer role as 6th man, but maybe something to keep in mind of you\u2019re deciding between him and carter late in the draft. </p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> \nBulls as a whole are trying to increase pace, 3s, and fouls.  They are probably going to try to use Vucevic more as a passer. Demar will continue to try to shoot more 3s. Lavine is healthy. PG and PF positions are up in the air.</p></div>",

For these numbers, **I only go by the top 180 Fantasy players for each season**.\n\n**How many players averaged 2 steals per game, or more** **in the 2022-2023 season?**\n\n22: 0  \n21: 1  \n20: 1  \n19: 2  \n18: 3  \n17: 6  \n16: 3  \n15: 6  \n14: 4  \n13: 3  \n12: 4  \n11: 3  \n10: 3  \n09: 3  \n08: 2  \n07: 6  \n06: 7  \n05: 5  \n04: 5  \n03: 4  \n02: 6  \n01: 4  \n00: 7  \n99: 7  \n98: 13  \n97: 8  \n96: 9  \n95: 8  \n94: 7  \n93: 9  \n92: 10  \n91: 12  \n90: 15  \n89: 14  \n88: 15  \n87: 13\n\nAs you can see, 22-23 was the first season in modern day NBA where not a single player averaged two steals or more per game. And we could\u2019ve seen it coming, as we only had two players (Butler and Dejounte) topping that number over the past two seasons. Looking at **averages**, steals have been clearly trending down, as well:\n\n2022 \u2013 2023 OG Anunoby at 1.90  \n2021 \u2013 2022 Dejounte Murray at 2.00  \n2020 \u2013 2021 Jimmy Butler at 2.10  \n2019 \u2013 2020 Ben Simmons at 2.00  \n2018 \u2013 2019 Paul George at 2.20  \n2017 \u2013 2018 Victor Oladipo at 2.36  \n2016 \u2013 2017 Draymond Green at 2.03  \n2015 \u2013 2016 Stephen Curry at 2.14  \n2014 \u2013 2015 Kawhi Leonard at 2.31  \n2013 \u2013 2014 Chris Paul at 2.48  \n2012 \u2013 2013 Chris Paul at 2.41  \n2011 \u2013 2012 Chris Paul at 2.53  \n2010 \u2013 2011 Chris Paul at 2.35  \n2009 \u2013 2010 Rajon Rondo at 2.33  \n2008 \u2013 2009 Chris Paul at 2.77  \n2007 \u2013 2008 Chris Paul at 2.71  \n2006 \u2013 2007 Baron Davis at 2.14  \n2005 \u2013 2006 Gerald Wallace at 2.51  \n2004 \u2013 2005 Larry Hughes at 2.89  \n2003 \u2013 2004 Baron Davis at 2.36  \n2002 \u2013 2003 Allen Iverson at 2.74  \n2001 \u2013 2002 Allen Iverson at 2.8  \n2000 \u2013 2001 Allen Iverson at 2.51  \n1999 \u2013 2000 Eddie Jones at 2.67  \n1998 \u2013 1999 Kendall Gill at 2.68  \n1997 \u2013 1998 Mookie Blaylock at 2.61  \n1996 \u2013 1997 Mookie Blaylock at 2.72  \n1995 \u2013 1996 Gary Payton at 2.85  \n1994 \u2013 1995 Scottie Pippen at 2.94  \n1993 \u2013 1994 Nate McMillan at 2.96  \n1992 \u2013 1993 Michael Jordan at 2.83  \n1991 \u2013 1992 John Stockton at 2.98  \n1990 \u2013 1991 Alvin Robertson 3.04  \n1989 \u2013 1990 Michael Jordan at 2.77  \n1988 \u2013 1989 John Stockton 3.21  \n1987 \u2013 1988 Michael Jordan 3.16\n\n**What\u2019s the average amount of steals these top 180 players got for each season?**\n\n2022 \u2013 2023: 0.91414065  \n2021 \u2013 2022: 0.93410100  \n2020 \u2013 2021: 0.93027035  \n2019 \u2013 2020: 0.94299695  \n2018 \u2013 2019: 0.94633821  \n2017 \u2013 2018: 1.02901983  \n2016 \u2013 2017: 1.01595659  \n2015 \u2013 2016: 1.05094439  \n2014 \u2013 2015: 1.00882484  \n2013 \u2013 2014: 1.02068121  \n2012 \u2013 2013: 1.05136976  \n2011 \u2013 2012: 1.01746295  \n2010 \u2013 2011: 0.98020540  \n2009 \u2013 2010: 0.99888955  \n2008 \u2013 2009: 1.01569093  \n2007 \u2013 2008: 1.01325937  \n2006 \u2013 2007: 1.01503578  \n2005 \u2013 2006: 0.99135125  \n2004 \u2013 2005: 1.04485752  \n2003 \u2013 2004: 1.07774316\n\nWhere it was hovering around 1 steal per game for years, it\u2019s now clearly in danger of dipping below 0.9 steals per game, which means guys getting close to 2 steals per game are becoming more and more valuable.\n\n**Your league leaders for steals (all avg over 1.5 spg):**\n\n1. Anunoby \u2013 1.9\n2. Delon Wright 1.8  \nJimmy Butler \u2013 1.8  \nFVV \u2013 1.8\n3. SGA \u2013 1.7\n4. Melton \u2013 1.6  \nHaliburton \u2013 1.6  \nAnt Edwards \u2013 1.6  \nTrent \u2013 1.6  \nHerb Jones \u2013 1.6\n\n**Players averaging over 1.3 spg:**\n\n1. Chris Paul \u2013 1.5  \nSmart \u2013 1.5  \nDejounte Murray \u2013 1.5  \nCaruso \u2013 1.5  \nPaul George \u2013 1.5  \nKCP \u2013 1.5  \nDonovan Mitchell \u2013 1.5  \nFultz \u2013 1.5\n2. Oubre \u2013 1.4  \nKevin Porter jr. \u2013 1.5  \nKahwi \u2013 1.4  \nJalen Williams \u2013 1.4  \nKillian Hayes \u2013 1.4  \nDoncic \u2013 1.4\n\nThat\u2019s it. For reference, 10 years ago, in the 2012-2013 season, there were 21 players who averaged 1.5 steals per game, or more.\n\nLet\u2019s zoom in on some of the names listed here:\n\n**OG** *\u2013* Always averaging around 1.5 spg, with a bump last year. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see it come down a bit more, towards 1.5 spg again.  \n**Delon** \u2013 Bit up and down, obviously heavily related to his minutes increase/decrease. Charlotte likes him as a back up PG, so situation probably wouldn\u2019t change too much for him. I see him getting around 24 mpg again, which means he could end up top 3 in spg again. What I don\u2019t like is that his role always seems to be somewhat up in the air. Just needs \\~24 mpg to make a dent in spg, but doesn\u2019t help out much elsewhere.  \n**Butler** \u2013 The safest play you could make for steals, however his games played per season hovers around 60, so that means he\u2019s probably gonna max out at 120 steals for the season: still good.  \n**FVV** \u2013 Now in Houston. Probably will split some minutes with KPjr and Thompson. FVV likes to gamble playing the passing lanes. Every season since 19-20 he\u2019s almost reached 2 spg. I don\u2019t think he dips too much, but who knows: Nurse\u2019s system really pushed for players to put unrelenting pressure on ball handlers.  \n**SGA** \u2013 Keeps trending up. I would not be surprised to see him lead the league in steals next year. Even though the usage might decrease a bit, he still is a good bet to give Jokic some competition as the best overall fantasy performer next year.  \n**Melton** \u2013 Sixers guaranteed his contract, and with Harden\u2019s status up in the air, it\u2019s hard to predict what will happen. He\u2019s now coached by Nick Nurse now, so that should at least keep your eyes on Melton as a possible league leader in steals. Also posted a single game-high (along with D\u2019Angelo Russell) of 7 steals last season.  \n**Haliburton** \u2013 While not a great defender, I can see his steals sustain, or rise, as the rest of the team matures.  \n**Ant Edwards** \u2013 stock will be soaring in drafts, and I feel his hype might be overblown a bit. Incredibly interesting upside, though. Do I see a lot of upside here for steals, beyond what he\u2019s shown? I doubt it.  \n**Trent** \u2013 Not buying this stock. Nurse is gone, and I\u2019m not even sure if Trent\u2019s role is secure. Might even get dealt. I\u2019m looking elsewhere for steals.  \n**Herb Jones** \u2013 I think he is what he is. And that\u2019s usueful. However, what if the Pelicans have Zion more available this season? Do you continue to play him with Herb, or do you opt to surround Zion with better shooters, like Trey, most of the time?  \n**Dejounte Murray** \u2013 Probably more of the same \u2013 led the league in steals during his last season with the Spurs, but now gambles a bit less and has to cover for Trae a bit more. 1.5-1.6 is what I expect from him, as is the case with Smart, Paul, George, and Mitchell. Kawhi could increase his averages from a career-low 1.4 per game, but I just don\u2019t trust him enough to play sufficient games.  \nI won\u2019t be buying any KPjr, Hayes, Oubre or Fultz stock for steals this year, as they either won\u2019t play enough or will have tough competition for their roles (Fultz). Doncic\u2019 steals dipped post AS game, which also was when Kyrie played most of his games. I don\u2019t trust Doncic to sustain the 1.4 spg he posted last season, and expect him to average closer to a single steal a game.  \n**Jalen Williams** is a dark horse to make it to the top three in steals this season. Hovered right around 1.7-2.0 steals per game post-all-star, and that team continues to improve, with Holmgren now manning the paint.\n\n**Some under the radar names to keep an eye on, in rostered % tiers:**\n\n**50%+ rostered**  \n**Immanuel Quickley** \u2013 Such a fun player, and I think he\u2019s only going to continue to improve. Plays both ends of the floor really well, and I\u2019d just love to see him and Grimes in the back court together. I feel like Quickley is one of the more underrated guards in the league. 61% rostered.  \n**Tre and Tyus Jones** \u2013 Both in somewhat similar situations in San Antonio and Washington. I don\u2019t trust either of them long term, but time and time again, they\u2019ve also shown to be incredibly useful back up point guards. Both should get enough minutes to produce in assists and steals (at least 1.2 per game), while not ruining your TO (Tyus sitting at 5.2:0.9).  \n**Zach Collins** \u2013 Where many believed Wemby would push Zach to the bench, it sounds like they\u2019re going to start together. Zach Collins is a sneaky play for steals at the C position, as he averaged over a steal per game post AS break last season. Rostered in 62% of Yahoo\u2019s leagues, he\u2019ll be hard to obtain.\n\n**25-50% rostered**  \n**Kentavious Caldwell-Pope** \u2013 Only rostered in 50% of Yahoo\u2019s leagues now. Granted, he\u2019s a specialist, but getting 1.8 threes and 1.5 spg at his price, could be a bargain. Secure role with the Nuggets, and doesn\u2019t dent your team anywhere, really.  \n**Paul Reed** \u2013 Keeping a firm eye on Reed and the Sixers\u2019 situation. With the Celtics and Bucks improving their teams a lot, and the Sixers (and Heat) sitting on their thumbs, mostly, I could see Morey wanting to start with a clean sheet soonish. Reed is locked up on a quite friendly contract and has huge upside. I know there were videos of him shooting the three off the dribble, but the shot still looked bad. Otherwise, Reed can do it all. Including racking up steals. As a center, which makes them even more valuable. Just a lot of risk involved, as his role is up in the air right now. Rostered in 33% of Yahoo\u2019s leagues, Reed does almost always produce when getting the minutes (14 steals, 22 blocks in 8 games in which he got 20+ minutes).  \n**Tari Eason** \u2013 Rostered in 46% of Yahoo\u2019s leagues, most people can\u2019t wait until Eason breaks out. Already averaging 1.2 spg in just 21 mpg, his upside is incredible for fantasy managers. I really want to see Eason (and Smith) run with a point guard, instead of whatever KPjr thought he was doing. Eason averaged almost two steals in 5 games as a starter, and he could find himself in the top three next season.  \n**Amen and Amir Thompson** \u2013 While they\u2019re quite different as players, I believe both will be among the league leaders in steals from the get-go. They\u2019re very strong and have both quick hands and feet. Minutes are available for both, as well.\n\n**0-25% rostered**  \n**Matisse Thybulle** \u2013 Could walk into a starting SF role with the Blazers, and averaged close to 1.7 steals per game over his last 20 games last season (27.6 mp).  \n**Delon Wright** \u2013 As mentioned above, status is up in the air, and with him, it\u2019s really only about steals. But he racks them up. Only rostered in 8% of Yahoo\u2019s leagues.  \n**Donte DiVincenzo** \u2013 Numbers don\u2019t jump off the page, but he\u2019s useful (1.3 spg). Knicks have some interesting positional battles, which brings me to\u2026  \n**Quentin Grimes** \u2013 One of my favorite break out players for next season. I\u2019m incredibly sure he\u2019s going to put it all together. His defense hasn\u2019t translated to great steals numbers as of yet, but I\u2019m willing to bet money that he\u2019s gonna be a hot target soon. Propping up Quickley and Grimes makes me sound like a Knicks fan. Which I\u2019m definitely not. Only rostered in 20% of Yahoo\u2019s leagues.  \n**Josh Green** \u2013 Dallas has horrible depth, and horrible defense. Josh Green should see a lot more minutes this season, and he\u2019s a good defender. As with Grimes, the defense hasn\u2019t translated to great steals numbers as of yet, but he could get there soon. Rostered in 7% of Yahoo\u2019s leagues.  \n**Jaden Springer** \u2013 Only rostered in 1% of Yahoo\u2019s league for a reason. Still can\u2019t shoot, or score, really. But his defense is amazing. In the right built, he could be a fun player down the road (do the Sixers blow it up? And is Springer going to be part of any plans after that?), but right now the Sixers have a better, and more complete version of Springer in Melton.  \n**Anthony Black** \u2013 Only rostered in 10% of Yahoo\u2019s leagues, which is less than Suggs (13%), and I truely believe Black is going to kill it this season. Such a smart, strong and skilled player. I also think he\u2019ll be among the rookie leaders in steals per game. I\u2019m not too worried about Suggs, and I think he\u2019s also a better fit than Fultz.  \n**Kris Dunn** \u2013 Depending on how the Jazz back court shakes out (I believe Keyonte George will be starting before year\u2019s end), Dunn could win that starting PG position, as he did quite well for the Jazz later last season. If he does, he could be a top 5 player in steals per game. Interesting streamer, rostered in 8% of Yahoo\u2019s leagues.  \n**Cam Whitmore** \u2013 With KPjr being gone, minutes have just opened up for Whitmore, who could surprise a lot of people (rostered in 9%), as he can produce across the board if give minutes. Averaged 1.4 steals per game in college.  \n**Dyson Daniels** \u2013 Sometimes reminds me of Anthony Randolph, in the sense that he has so many tools and so much raw talent, yet he\u2019s also so incredibly\u2026 raw. A lot of the stuff he does seems to be relying on talent and instincts, but going back to the basics is hard for him. The Pelicans have quite a few options at guard, but I\u2019m interested to follow Daniels closely.  \n**Jaylin Williams** \u2013 I truely believe Chet Holmgren would play best, at least early on in his career, with Jaylin next to him. If Williams tops 24 mpg, he could be a useful source of steals at the C position. I think Jaylin Williams could develop into a player in the mold of an Al Horford (albeit the chance of reaching that same level is small).  \n**Alex Caruso** \u2013 Definitely belongs as a target for any team looking to add steals to its roster. Caruso will see enough minutes to be useful, and always comes through. With steals. Can you survive the lack of production in other cats?\n\n[**https://perkinsfor3.wordpress.com/2023/10/02/prince-among-thieves-securing-your-steals-2023-2024/**](https://perkinsfor3.wordpress.com/2023/10/02/prince-among-thieves-securing-your-steals-2023-2024/)<div><br></div><div><p>Man, blocks and steals are harder and harder to find, meaning you\u2019ll likely have to pay up a fair amount if you\u2019re looking to obtain them through trades or early on in drafts.</p>\n<p>As always, let\u2019s take a look at some numbers from the past, and see how they compare to the current day NBA.

For reference, 10 years ago, in the 2012-2013 season, there were 21 players who averaged 1.5 steals per game, or more.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s zoom in on some of the names listed here:</p>\n<p><strong>OG</strong> <em>\u2013</em> Always averaging around 1.5 spg, with a bump last year. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see it come down a bit more, towards 1.5 spg again.<br />\n<strong>Delon</strong> \u2013 Bit up and down, obviously heavily related to his minutes increase/decrease. Charlotte likes him as a back up PG, so situation probably wouldn\u2019t change too much for him. I see him getting around 24 mpg again, which means he could end up top 3 in spg again. What I don\u2019t like is that his role always seems to be somewhat up in the air. Just needs \\~24 mpg to make a dent in spg, but doesn\u2019t help out much elsewhere.<br />\n<strong>Butler</strong> \u2013 The safest play you could make for steals, however his games played per season hovers around 60, so that means he\u2019s probably gonna max out at 120 steals for the season: still good.<br />\n<strong>FVV</strong> \u2013 Now in Houston. Probably will split some minutes with KPjr and Thompson. FVV likes to gamble playing the passing lanes. Every season since 19-20 he\u2019s almost reached 2 spg. I don\u2019t think he dips too much, but who knows: Nurse\u2019s system really pushed for players to put unrelenting pressure on ball handlers.<br />\n<strong>SGA</strong> \u2013 Keeps trending up. I would not be surprised to see him lead the league in steals next year. Even though the usage might decrease a bit, he still is a good bet to give Jokic some competition as the best overall fantasy performer next year.<br />\n<strong>Melton</strong> \u2013 Sixers guaranteed his contract, and with Harden\u2019s status up in the air, it\u2019s hard to predict what will happen. He\u2019s now coached by Nick Nurse now, so that should at least keep your eyes on Melton as a possible league leader in steals. Also posted a single game-high (along with D\u2019Angelo Russell) of 7 steals last season.<br />\n<strong>Haliburton</strong> \u2013 While not a great defender, I can see his steals sustain, or rise, as the rest of the team matures.<br />\n<strong>Ant Edwards</strong> \u2013 stock will be soaring in drafts, and I feel his hype might be overblown a bit. Incredibly interesting upside, though. Do I see a lot of upside here for steals, beyond what he\u2019s shown? I doubt it.<br />\n<strong>Trent</strong> \u2013 Not buying this stock. Nurse is gone, and I\u2019m not even sure if Trent\u2019s role is secure. Might even get dealt. I\u2019m looking elsewhere for steals.<br />\n<strong>Herb Jones</strong> \u2013 I think he is what he is. And that\u2019s usueful. However, what if the Pelicans have Zion more available this season? Do you continue to play him with Herb, or do you opt to surround Zion with better shooters, like Trey, most of the time?<br />\n<strong>Dejounte Murray</strong> \u2013 Probably more of the same \u2013 led the league in steals during his last season with the Spurs, but now gambles a bit less and has to cover for Trae a bit more. 1.5-1.6 is what I expect from him, as is the case with Smart, Paul, George, and Mitchell. Kawhi could increase his averages from a career-low 1.4 per game, but I just don\u2019t trust him enough to play sufficient games.<br />\nI won\u2019t be buying any KPjr, Hayes, Oubre or Fultz stock for steals this year, as they either won\u2019t play enough or will have tough competition for their roles (Fultz). Doncic\u2019 steals dipped post AS game, which also was when Kyrie played most of his games. I don\u2019t trust Doncic to sustain the 1.4 spg he posted last season, and expect him to average closer to a single steal a game.<br />\n<strong>Jalen Williams</strong> is a dark horse to make it to the top three in steals this season. Hovered right around 1.7-2.0 steals per game post-all-star, and that team continues to improve, with Holmgren now manning the paint.</p>\n<p><strong>Some under the radar names to keep an eye on, in rostered % tiers:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>50%+ rostered</strong><br />\n<strong>Immanuel Quickley</strong> \u2013 Such a fun player, and I think he\u2019s only going to continue to improve. Plays both ends of the floor really well, and I\u2019d just love to see him and Grimes in the back court together. I feel like Quickley is one of the more underrated guards in the league. 61% rostered.<br />\n<strong>Tre and Tyus Jones</strong> \u2013 Both in somewhat similar situations in San Antonio and Washington. I don\u2019t trust either of them long term, but time and time again, they\u2019ve also shown to be incredibly useful back up point guards. Both should get enough minutes to produce in assists and steals (at least 1.2 per game), while not ruining your TO (Tyus sitting at 5.2:0.9).<br />\n<strong>Zach Collins</strong> \u2013 Where many believed Wemby would push Zach to the bench, it sounds like they\u2019re going to start together. Zach Collins is a sneaky play for steals at the C position, as he averaged over a steal per game post AS break last season. Rostered in 62% of Yahoo\u2019s leagues, he\u2019ll be hard to obtain.</p>\n<p><strong>25-50% rostered</strong><br />\n<strong>Kentavious Caldwell-Pope</strong> \u2013 Only rostered in 50% of Yahoo\u2019s leagues now. Granted, he\u2019s a specialist, but getting 1.8 threes and 1.5 spg at his price, could be a bargain. Secure role with the Nuggets, and doesn\u2019t dent your team anywhere, really.<br />\n<strong>Paul Reed</strong> \u2013 Keeping a firm eye on Reed and the Sixers\u2019 situation. With the Celtics and Bucks improving their teams a lot, and the Sixers (and Heat) sitting on their thumbs, mostly, I could see Morey wanting to start with a clean sheet soonish. Reed is locked up on a quite friendly contract and has huge upside. I know there were videos of him shooting the three off the dribble, but the shot still looked bad. Otherwise, Reed can do it all. Including racking up steals. As a center, which makes them even more valuable. Just a lot of risk involved, as his role is up in the air right now. Rostered in 33% of Yahoo\u2019s leagues, Reed does almost always produce when getting the minutes (14 steals, 22 blocks in 8 games in which he got 20+ minutes).<br />\n<strong>Tari Eason</strong> \u2013 Rostered in 46% of Yahoo\u2019s leagues, most people can\u2019t wait until Eason breaks out. Already averaging 1.2 spg in just 21 mpg, his upside is incredible for fantasy managers. I really want to see Eason (and Smith) run with a point guard, instead of whatever KPjr thought he was doing. Eason averaged almost two steals in 5 games as a starter, and he could find himself in the top three next season.<br />\n<strong>Amen and Amir Thompson</strong> \u2013 While they\u2019re quite different as players, I believe both will be among the league leaders in steals from the get-go. They\u2019re very strong and have both quick hands and feet. Minutes are available for both, as well.</p>\n<p><strong>0-25% rostered</strong><br />\n<strong>Matisse Thybulle</strong> \u2013 Could walk into a starting SF role with the Blazers, and averaged close to 1.7 steals per game over his last 20 games last season (27.6 mp).<br />\n<strong>Delon Wright</strong> \u2013 As mentioned above, status is up in the air, and with him, it\u2019s really only about steals. But he racks them up. Only rostered in 8% of Yahoo\u2019s leagues.<br />\n<strong>Donte DiVincenzo</strong> \u2013 Numbers don\u2019t jump off the page, but he\u2019s useful (1.3 spg). Knicks have some interesting positional battles, which brings me to\u2026<br />\n<strong>Quentin Grimes</strong> \u2013 One of my favorite break out players for next season. I\u2019m incredibly sure he\u2019s going to put it all together. His defense hasn\u2019t translated to great steals numbers as of yet, but I\u2019m willing to bet money that he\u2019s gonna be a hot target soon. Propping up Quickley and Grimes makes me sound like a Knicks fan. Which I\u2019m definitely not. Only rostered in 20% of Yahoo\u2019s leagues.<br />\n<strong>Josh Green</strong> \u2013 Dallas has horrible depth, and horrible defense. Josh Green should see a lot more minutes this season, and he\u2019s a good defender. As with Grimes, the defense hasn\u2019t translated to great steals numbers as of yet, but he could get there soon. Rostered in 7% of Yahoo\u2019s leagues.<br />\n<strong>Jaden Springer</strong> \u2013 Only rostered in 1% of Yahoo\u2019s league for a reason. Still can\u2019t shoot, or score, really. But his defense is amazing. In the right built, he could be a fun player down the road (do the Sixers blow it up? And is Springer going to be part of any plans after that?), but right now the Sixers have a better, and more complete version of Springer in Melton.<br />\n<strong>Anthony Black</strong> \u2013 Only rostered in 10% of Yahoo\u2019s leagues, which is less than Suggs (13%), and I truely believe Black is going to kill it this season. Such a smart, strong and skilled player. I also think he\u2019ll be among the rookie leaders in steals per game. I\u2019m not too worried about Suggs, and I think he\u2019s also a better fit than Fultz.<br />\n<strong>Kris Dunn</strong> \u2013 Depending on how the Jazz back court shakes out (I believe Keyonte George will be starting before year\u2019s end), Dunn could win that starting PG position, as he did quite well for the Jazz later last season. If he does, he could be a top 5 player in steals per game. Interesting streamer, rostered in 8% of Yahoo\u2019s leagues.<br />\n<strong>Cam Whitmore</strong> \u2013 With KPjr being gone, minutes have just opened up for Whitmore, who could surprise a lot of people (rostered in 9%), as he can produce across the board if give minutes. Averaged 1.4 steals per game in college.<br />\n<strong>Dyson Daniels</strong> \u2013 Sometimes reminds me of Anthony Randolph, in the sense that he has so many tools and so much raw talent, yet he\u2019s also so incredibly\u2026 raw. A lot of the stuff he does seems to be relying on talent and instincts, but going back to the basics is hard for him. The Pelicans have quite a few options at guard, but I\u2019m interested to follow Daniels closely.<br />\n<strong>Jaylin Williams</strong> \u2013 I truely believe Chet Holmgren would play best, at least early on in his career, with Jaylin next to him. If Williams tops 24 mpg, he could be a useful source of steals at the C position. I think Jaylin Williams could develop into a player in the mold of an Al Horford (albeit the chance of reaching that same level is small).<br />\n<strong>Alex Caruso</strong> \u2013 Definitely belongs as a target for any team looking to add steals to its roster. Caruso will see enough minutes to be useful, and always comes through. With steals. Can you survive the lack of production in other cats?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://perkinsfor3.wordpress.com/2023/10/02/prince-among-thieves-securing-your-steals-2023-2024/\"><strong>https://perkinsfor3.wordpress.com/2023/10/02/prince-among-thieves-securing-your-steals-2023-2024/</strong></a></p></div>",

I beg to differ. So, Ayton goes from PHX to POR that means no more KD and Booker taking the shots, right? Well Simons shot it 19 times a game last season. Booker 20. Jerami Grant took just shy of 15 shots a game last year and now he has a huge contract and no Lillard usage. Expect that to be 17 or 18. You have Scoot coming in who will be sure to take more usage away along with Rookie pains. Sharpe is looking to emerge as a young star.  I just don't see from a points standpoint he gets any better. Rebounding is the only category I see him maybe taking a small leap in. He isnt a huge steals/blocks guy. So basically, you are looking at a small rebounding boost not to mention his prior work ethic rumors. That being said I am not swayed by the new team buzz. I don't see it much of a boost</p></div>",

Let's break down the instant fantasy takes.</p>\n<p>Fantasy WINNERS:</p>\n<p><strong>Dame Lillard</strong>: Dames value was falling the last few weeks as the possibility of a holdout loomed. You have to imagine the Bucks got some form of security from Dames camp that he would play. Dame is a first rounder when playing and he seems poised to lead a bucks offense and team that suddenly seems top heavy.</p>\n<p><strong>Deandre Ayton</strong>: He is going to get WAYYY more offensive opportunities on a trailblazers team that is in full rebuild mode. You would imagine the Blazers try and pump him and his stats up to make the Dame trade look better. There is a small chance he is retraded, but in our opinion its smaller than Jrue.</p>\n<p><strong>Grayson Allen:</strong> He is going to a super thin Suns team that has several players who could go down with an injury at any given time. Once Middleton came back last year Grayson fell off, but he has proven when given opportunity he can be fantasy relevent. The suns core should be drawing lots of doubles and creating open looks and Allen is a deadly catch and shoot player.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Fantasy Losers: </p>\n<p><strong>The Blazers</strong> Logjammed <strong>guards</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Jrue:</strong> Jrue now steps right into the limbo that Dame was in. He doesn't fit age wise in the direction the Trailblazers are going, and he could be rerouted before the deadline.</p>\n<p><strong>Simons &amp; Scoot:</strong> We thought they might have a clear path to the city (and they will still get a lot of touches even with Jrue) but now there are a firm 3 guards that need to play instead of the potential for 2 had the Dame trade brought back a wing and a big instead of a guard and a big. </p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Even value or not enough change to warrant a designation:</p>\n<p><strong>Nurk</strong> seems like a slight boost in value, but questions about his health remain the biggest hurdle, with as many great bigs as there are late in the draft I won't be reaching for him.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Who do you think won this trade?</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Link for our full reaction below</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/W0_yi5Ib9co?si=FMLlSNC5ytvdrwjt\">Trade Video</a></p></div>",
