I wanted to share a project I've been working on that I hope you will find interesting. I am a student just about to graduate from computer science and I have been spending the last few months building a project to automatically pick up players from the Yahoo fantasy wire. No more 3AM wake-up calls to snag the best players for the next day's games. \ud83c\udfc0</p>\n<p>If you're interested in giving this tool a try or just want to hear more about it, please send me a direct message. Your feedback could be a game-changer in refining this project.</p>\n<p>Hope it helps some people. I noticed in another thread that people were patiently waiting on Yahoo for waivers to clear.</p>\n<p>Don't use if your league considers it cheating.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>",

Where are we at on Jalen for rest of season and long term for the dynasty leagues? He\u2019s only 21 and Atlanta is still learning to incorporate him into their offense. But also his shooting numbers have got to regress a little bit. </p>\n<p>Is he on a Paul George trajectory? Or maybe just OG? Or is he more like Aaron Gordon where he ends up being a solid role player for many years but never quite lived up to the hype? My thinking is the latter is the most likely so there may be a small sell high window now, specifically in dynasty leagues. Mostly because he is probably playing at close to what his peak is now. Or does anyone else think he has another level he can get to?</p>",

OG has been having his worst averages across the last 4 years in points, stls, rebs, assists (admittedly by a trivial margin), and ft%. He used to have strong starts to the season and then cool down around Jan, if he cools down any further this year I may drop him. </p>\n<p>Would have tried to sell him but my mates sooner sell their souls than do trades in our league. Anybody know what is going on with OG and Raptors? Should I hold and hope that new coach and playing style will take time to adjust or was it Nurse\u2019s system generating steals and OG is no longer a top 100 guy?</p>",

His points, 3s, and (imo the real disappointment) stocks are all down from last season, while his TOs are way up. Over the last week of play, Basketball Monster has him clocking in at a pretty horrible #104 ranking in total value despite playing four games. Watching snippets of the Nets game yesterday, he mostly looked ineffective on the offensive side of the ball and didn't have much of a presence on the defensive end either.</p>\n<p>Bridges owners, how are we feeling? So far, it looks like he just isn't that guy who can create his own buckets when being guarded by the other team's best defender. Do we hold and wait for his value to increase, or do we cut loose now and try to sell before further mediocrity drops his value even lower? Or is the real value with Bridges his ironman ability to play every game despite forgettable per game averages? Those who have watched more Nets games than I have, how has he looked? I don't want to panic yet, but given his ADP I'm sure there are a lot of Bridges managers off to slow starts thus far.</p>",

(It's not extremely impressive with his weakness in the pick and roll game, however it's there doesn't appear to be any other weaknesses to his game) </p>\n<p>\"Defensively, the book on ____ starts with his historic turnover-forcing ability. As the all-time leader in NCAA history for steals in a college career, ______ has a nose for the ball, whether it be with his active and accurate hands or his ability to read the passing lanes. While he will struggle to contest shots, his threat for forcing turnovers will be impactful on defense. He doesn\u2019t lose positioning when going for steals, which makes him a pest defensively. If a team can hide him effectively in playing to his strengths of forcing turnovers while reducing his weaknesses as a shot alterer, he will emerge as a neutral or slightly positive defender.  </p>\n<p>Offensively, ________ basketball IQ allows him to be a floor general, quick shooter off of dribble moves, and an off-ball threat as a spot-up shooter with a quick release. Despite being undersized, ________ does a good job of taking advantage of mismatches and shooting over defenders quickly, both in spot-ups and off the dribble and self-creation moves.  </p>\n<p>However, one college coach I spoke to noted his excellent college career and skills, but mentioned his limitations in using the pick &amp; roll, which opened my eyes to an area I had previously overlooked. While he is not remotely bad in the pick &amp; roll as a ball-handler, he is a simple playmaker, and somewhat predictable as a scorer out of ball-screen sets. On the year, _______ had rough numbers out of the pick &amp; roll, per Synergy: 63rd percentile in overall P&amp;R sets including passes, but he shot 29% out of P&amp;R sets on 109 attempts. He generally used two moves, a stepback and straight-line drives to the rim, off of screens. In order to stick in the NBA, he will have to be more creative out of screens both as a playmaker and scorer.  </p>\n<p>Overall, ______  being a nearly mistake-free player while creating tons of mistakes for opposing offensive players as a defender, while also possessing a good jump shot, make him an interesting dark-horse for a backup guard in the NBA. While other smaller players with overlapping skill-sets have not been able to make the leap to the NBA, ______ smooth jumper separates him in terms of skill-set from other undersized guards in the past.\"  </p>\n<p>Thoughts? </p>",

Bridges is doing what he can to be ready to play and fantasy managers who are willing to ignore the off-court issues may want to stash him ahead of his return if he is available.

The dude has produced way more lowlights and honestly looks like a wannabe street baller on an NBA court. Got excited after his 41 point explosion against the knicks in the preseason, but now more worried than ever. Hopefully the Wizards also stop getting blown out so he plays more than 30 minutes per game.</p>\n<p>Anyone else also a bit worried? What are you going to do with him if you have him on your team?</p>\n<p>12T/9Cat/H2H</p>",
