What are we doing with Josh? Is it time we say fuck off or are we riding it out. It\u2019s pretty clear hes the 4th option on this team and that won\u2019t change barring an injury. The coach also doesn\u2019t think hes good enough to end the game with either. Lowkey a waiver wire player can produce better numbers.</p>",

Jaden Ivey should be a player that fantasy teams are targeting (especially in a dynasty league) before his buy-low window closes </p>\n<p>In his last 5 games, Ivey has put up the following numbers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>15 points, 7 rebounds, 7 assists, 1 steal, 1 block, 50% FG</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>25 points, 2 rebounds, 3 assists, 1 steal, 1 block, 56% FG</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>17 points, 4 rebounds, 3 assists, 1 steal, 87% FG</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>9 points, 3 rebounds, 4 assists, 28 minutes played </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>11 points, 2 rebounds, 3 assists, 1 steal, 66% FG</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These numbers come out to 15.4 points, 3.6 rebounds, 4.0 assists, 55% FG, 30 mpg over his last 5 games </p>\n<p>Monty Williams has finally given Ivey a chance over the last couple weeks, and Jaden has not disappointed one bit. At only 21 years old, it\u2019s safe to assume that he will continue to grow his game &amp; get solid minutes on a very, very bad pistons team. Ivey\u2019s biggest competition for minutes is Killian Hayes, who has sucked recently </p>\n<p>Reach out to the Ivey owner in your league &amp; see if you\u2019re able to capitalize on the buy-low window before it\u2019s TOO LATE</p>",

But also his shooting numbers have got to regress a little bit. </p>\n<p>Is he on a Paul George trajectory? Or maybe just OG? Or is he more like Aaron Gordon where he ends up being a solid role player for many years but never quite lived up to the hype? My thinking is the latter is the most likely so there may be a small sell high window now, specifically in dynasty leagues. Mostly because he is probably playing at close to what his peak is now.

I thought, in my punt 3 build I was getting a 40-50 range plater with decent % and nice steals. OG has been having his worst averages across the last 4 years in points, stls, rebs, assists (admittedly by a trivial margin), and ft%. He used to have strong starts to the season and then cool down around Jan, if he cools down any further this year I may drop him. </p>\n<p>Would have tried to sell him but my mates sooner sell their souls than do trades in our league. Anybody know what is going on with OG and Raptors? Should I hold and hope that new coach and playing style will take time to adjust or was it Nurse\u2019s system generating steals and OG is no longer a top 100 guy?</p>",

His points, 3s, and (imo the real disappointment) stocks are all down from last season, while his TOs are way up. Over the last week of play, Basketball Monster has him clocking in at a pretty horrible #104 ranking in total value despite playing four games. Watching snippets of the Nets game yesterday, he mostly looked ineffective on the offensive side of the ball and didn't have much of a presence on the defensive end either.</p>\n<p>Bridges owners, how are we feeling? So far, it looks like he just isn't that guy who can create his own buckets when being guarded by the other team's best defender. Do we hold and wait for his value to increase, or do we cut loose now and try to sell before further mediocrity drops his value even lower? Or is the real value with Bridges his ironman ability to play every game despite forgettable per game averages? Those who have watched more Nets games than I have, how has he looked? I don't want to panic yet, but given his ADP I'm sure there are a lot of Bridges managers off to slow starts thus far.</p>",

(It's not extremely impressive with his weakness in the pick and roll game, however it's there doesn't appear to be any other weaknesses to his game) </p>\n<p>\"Defensively, the book on ____ starts with his historic turnover-forcing ability. As the all-time leader in NCAA history for steals in a college career, ______ has a nose for the ball, whether it be with his active and accurate hands or his ability to read the passing lanes. While he will struggle to contest shots, his threat for forcing turnovers will be impactful on defense. He doesn\u2019t lose positioning when going for steals, which makes him a pest defensively. If a team can hide him effectively in playing to his strengths of forcing turnovers while reducing his weaknesses as a shot alterer, he will emerge as a neutral or slightly positive defender.  </p>\n<p>Offensively, ________ basketball IQ allows him to be a floor general, quick shooter off of dribble moves, and an off-ball threat as a spot-up shooter with a quick release. Despite being undersized, ________ does a good job of taking advantage of mismatches and shooting over defenders quickly, both in spot-ups and off the dribble and self-creation moves.  </p>\n<p>However, one college coach I spoke to noted his excellent college career and skills, but mentioned his limitations in using the pick &amp; roll, which opened my eyes to an area I had previously overlooked. While he is not remotely bad in the pick &amp; roll as a ball-handler, he is a simple playmaker, and somewhat predictable as a scorer out of ball-screen sets. On the year, _______ had rough numbers out of the pick &amp; roll, per Synergy: 63rd percentile in overall P&amp;R sets including passes, but he shot 29% out of P&amp;R sets on 109 attempts. He generally used two moves, a stepback and straight-line drives to the rim, off of screens. In order to stick in the NBA, he will have to be more creative out of screens both as a playmaker and scorer.  </p>\n<p>Overall, ______  being a nearly mistake-free player while creating tons of mistakes for opposing offensive players as a defender, while also possessing a good jump shot, make him an interesting dark-horse for a backup guard in the NBA. While other smaller players with overlapping skill-sets have not been able to make the leap to the NBA, ______ smooth jumper separates him in terms of skill-set from other undersized guards in the past.\"  </p>\n<p>Thoughts? </p>",
