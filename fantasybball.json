His points, 3s, and (imo the real disappointment) stocks are all down from last season, while his TOs are way up. Over the last week of play, Basketball Monster has him clocking in at a pretty horrible #104 ranking in total value despite playing four games. Watching snippets of the Nets game yesterday, he mostly looked ineffective on the offensive side of the ball and didn't have much of a presence on the defensive end either.</p>\n<p>Bridges owners, how are we feeling? So far, it looks like he just isn't that guy who can create his own buckets when being guarded by the other team's best defender. Do we hold and wait for his value to increase, or do we cut loose now and try to sell before further mediocrity drops his value even lower? Or is the real value with Bridges his ironman ability to play every game despite forgettable per game averages? Those who have watched more Nets games than I have, how has he looked? I don't want to panic yet, but given his ADP I'm sure there are a lot of Bridges managers off to slow starts thus far.</p>",

His suspension is lifted on Friday and Clifford said he\u2019ll walk into a \u201csignificant role\u201d.

(It's not extremely impressive with his weakness in the pick and roll game, however it's there doesn't appear to be any other weaknesses to his game) </p>\n<p>\"Defensively, the book on ____ starts with his historic turnover-forcing ability. As the all-time leader in NCAA history for steals in a college career, ______ has a nose for the ball, whether it be with his active and accurate hands or his ability to read the passing lanes. While he will struggle to contest shots, his threat for forcing turnovers will be impactful on defense. He doesn\u2019t lose positioning when going for steals, which makes him a pest defensively. If a team can hide him effectively in playing to his strengths of forcing turnovers while reducing his weaknesses as a shot alterer, he will emerge as a neutral or slightly positive defender.  </p>\n<p>Offensively, ________ basketball IQ allows him to be a floor general, quick shooter off of dribble moves, and an off-ball threat as a spot-up shooter with a quick release. Despite being undersized, ________ does a good job of taking advantage of mismatches and shooting over defenders quickly, both in spot-ups and off the dribble and self-creation moves.  </p>\n<p>However, one college coach I spoke to noted his excellent college career and skills, but mentioned his limitations in using the pick &amp; roll, which opened my eyes to an area I had previously overlooked. While he is not remotely bad in the pick &amp; roll as a ball-handler, he is a simple playmaker, and somewhat predictable as a scorer out of ball-screen sets. On the year, _______ had rough numbers out of the pick &amp; roll, per Synergy: 63rd percentile in overall P&amp;R sets including passes, but he shot 29% out of P&amp;R sets on 109 attempts. He generally used two moves, a stepback and straight-line drives to the rim, off of screens. In order to stick in the NBA, he will have to be more creative out of screens both as a playmaker and scorer.  </p>\n<p>Overall, ______  being a nearly mistake-free player while creating tons of mistakes for opposing offensive players as a defender, while also possessing a good jump shot, make him an interesting dark-horse for a backup guard in the NBA. While other smaller players with overlapping skill-sets have not been able to make the leap to the NBA, ______ smooth jumper separates him in terms of skill-set from other undersized guards in the past.\"  </p>\n<p>Thoughts? </p>",

The incident reported in early October does not seem like it will cause an extended suspension as of this moment. Bridges is doing what he can to be ready to play and fantasy managers who are willing to ignore the off-court issues may want to stash him ahead of his return if he is available. Of course, he will likely need to shake off some rust and it is understandable if you'd prefer to compete without going near him.</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/ethosfantasybk/status/1723047698343895168?s=46&amp;t=W-xQix0DudmPRJOdU9dnoA</p>",

You see, Will Hardy in his unfathomable brilliance has deduced that Kessler should stand at the perimeter and shoot 3s. This not only takes him out of the paint, thus decreasing his rebound and blocks but also ruins his fg% because the man has shot a total of like 3 three pointers last year. </p>\n<p>This also doesn't space the floor because players treat him like Ben Simmons out there and he won't get any looks cuz THT and Sexton have the combined IQ and the vision of loaf of bread. </p>\n<p>This CAN NOT be sustainable as a strategy. Im assuming it's a test run that is failing magnificently or he will be removed from the starting lineup all together. Both might actually be beneficial for us. </p>\n<p>I can't imagine I've ever seen a coach waste potential ROY talent like this in my life.</p>",

Grabbing at least 14 boards a game, shooting 80% from the field and averaging 2.7 blocks - he is flying, and he reminds me of a prime Andre Drummond.  It is clear that he is the #1 option at C for Detroit and his 1-2 punch combo with Cade is looking filthy.  While I believe he will be top 50 ROS, I question whether he can keep this top 10 production up. Sure the boards may stay, but 80% shooting will likely taper off.  Where do you see him finishing the season once/if this amazing start comes back to earth? Is he a sell high or is this realistic production? With that all being said, Is it worth selling him now for a guy like JJJ or Lauri in points leagues or another guy in that top 30-40 rank?</p>",

(mostly to appease your confirmation biases, but hopefully a tad more? haha)</p>\n<p>Jazz vs Suns</p>\n<p>Blowout game easy win despite being injured for the suns! They shot 53 as a team and 93% from the line! Wow! When you shoot that well usually you win. In addition they only had 11 turnovers! Suns are extremely good folks.</p>\n<p>Kevin Durant being that first round freak. 26pts on insane 8-11 FG, 9-9 FTM, 4rebs, 7ast, 1stl, 1block. As long as Beal and Booker are out continue to expect higher usage (esp the ast). Roto KING for how he boosts your percentages.</p>\n<p>Nurkic you would have thought stepped up more scoring but only had 10pts on 8 shots, still helped with 7rebs, 6ast, 2stl, 1blck. Only 23 mins? (probably cuz the blowout)</p>\n<p>Eric Gordon 21pts on 9-14FG, 3threes, 2rebs, 4ast, 1stl. Continue to ride while suns are injured. Might be able to trade him (sell high) to an unaware or \"newer\" or bad manager.</p>\n<p>Grayson Allen 17pts, 4rebs, 3ast, 2stl. Same story as Gordon, but probably has less trade appeal than Gordon does. He will be a quality stream for threes or pts numerous times this season.</p>\n<p>Okogie only 7pts, 1 reb, don't need to hold, but PHO good schedule next week so it's a must drop either. This is very disappointing.</p>\n<p>Drew Eubanks continues to be valuable 85% shooting, 12pts, 5rebs, 2ast, 2blocks. You use him for his FG%, REBS, BLOCKS. (holy trinity of big men). I think he will finish around top 125 even top 100 value even as a backup getting 19 min here.</p>\n<p>Jordan Goodwin 100% FTM (6-6), 2threes, 5rebs, 5ast, 1stl. Something to pay attention to for an AST streaming option. He shot 2-9 tho so will likely be a drain on your FG%.</p>\n<p>For Jazz:</p>\n<p>Lauri Markanan 19pts, (7-13), 5threes, 3rebs, 1stl, 2blocks. REBS a bit low, but still a nice game. His usage is high.</p>\n<p>John Collins 11pts, (5-9) 10rebs, 3ast. Nice double double but no defense here.</p>\n<p>Walker Kessler 2pts, 25% shooting albeit low volume so it \"hurts you less\" 1-4, (again he shot 2 threes), 5rebs, 1ast, 1block, 3turnovers. Obviously terrible. His playing time is low, John Collins continues to outrebound him. If Kessler is standing in the corner too often waiting for threes he won't be collecting rebs folks. So this is a huge concern. 3 games in now. You could probably BUY HIM VERY LOW. But I'm not even confident that he will get back to last year kessler. Still 3 games is a small sample size. And we KNOW the talent that kessler does have. Just don't know why the coach isn't utilizing him correctly or only giving him 23 mins. If you try to sell on him you would vastly not get proper value for how high his upside could be (mainly for FG%, REBS, BLOCKS) but really I don't know. I see a bit of writing on the wall and willing to re assess my preseason hype of kessler. This is a BIG PROBLEM. Is he even going to get those rebs or FG% if he is jacking up threes and hanging out in the corner? That would downgrade him to mostly a one category player in blocks. I am entertaining the possibility of trading him (I own him in many leagues) for a guy who is currently giving us \"similar stats of peak kessler\" like a Mitchell Robinson or Duren. (Likely easier to obtain Robinson of those two). Also Robinson is significantly better at steals both in past years and proven this year. (underrated little/big gem in punt pts teams) One thing is for sure, YOU DO NOT DROP. The other thing to mention here is Jazz are an experimental team. They clearly will not be winning and at some point tanking. So their play style and what the coach designs may fluctuate as season goes (or the coach gets fired). Thus the talent that kessler has (and oh boy is he a talented rebounder and blocker and FG%) SHOULD/MIGHT come back at some point? Might be a reason for optimism? I feel like in the comments Kessler will be a big discussion piece... I have said enough, moving on.</p>\n<p>Jordan Clarkson shot 30% only 2rebs, 2ast, 5 turnovers. Eek. He is usually pretty up and down, could likely score 25 next game. lol.</p>\n<p>Talen Horton Tucker 4pts on 1-7FG, 1ast, 1stl. I guess one positive is zero turnovers. If you need to stream to win your matchup you can let go of him, but could be a re-add next week or after. Bit of a fringe player and maybe not a long term part of the jazz future? (none of us know for sure tho) He would need to play himself into continue to get starts and this is NOT IT. Only 16mins too (but I reckon that's cuz there was garbage time minutes for backups) You want players who are surging, who have upside or trade appeal. THT does not have that. He is now shooting 26% on the season. Matter of time before Sexton/George/Dunn starts instead. Might happen as soon as next game? Maybe THT is part of the problem not getting kessler involved enough? Again Jazz are experimental and not a championship team...</p>\n<p>Keyonte George, similar to THT he didn't shoot well 4-12, but still gave 7rebs, 6ast, 1stl to be useful in 27 mins. Probably should be stashed in Roto format leagues.</p>\n<p>Sexton 14pts, 50% FG, 6-6FTM, 2rebs, 6ast. He might end up starting very soon...</p>\n<p>Kris Dunn had 3ast, 2stls in typical dunn fashion, but little else. Keep on eye on him as a steals streamer (and sorta ast) all season. Plus upside IF he is the one that wins out for starter minutes.</p>\n<p>Olynyk was alright again with 9pts on 80%, 6rebs, 3ast. Taking mins from kessler?</p>\n<p>Heat vs Timberwolves</p>\n<p>Well you don't play your superstar (Jimmy Butler) cuz he needs \"rest\" after 2 games how can you expect to win? Heat started Jovic (who actually looked good) and Jaquez Jr. Yup. Apparently K Love is hurt too? I don't believe that. NBA needs to step in and FINE THEM! Make me pretty angry. I knew I should have selected Scottie Barnes over Jimmy Butler in more leagues (and probably a trade many of you should do right now) in that 2nd round. (I actually did this in 2 leagues as it was a draft day debate for me cuz barnes fits my build immensely) Timberwolves annhilated them by 16pts shooting 51% to 40%.</p>\n<p>Anthony Edwards 19pts, 7-15FG, 3threes, 2rebs, 7ast. I love those 7ast, no steals or blocks tho?</p>\n<p>Towns, 12pts, 10rebs, 2ast, 1stl, only 1 turnover. Only 40% shooting. I think he can step up more scoring than this but I mean the twolves won with a balanced usage approach so can't really argue with it?</p>\n<p>Gobert 14pts on 7-9FG, 14rebs, 1ast, 1stl. No blocks are disappointing, but he is looking like the elite FG%, elite REBS type of guy he always has been. I ponder a trade like Kessler for Gobert? Hmmmm...</p>\n<p>Mike Conley 14pts on 60%, 2threes, 4rebs, 5ast, 1stl. Good game from the underrated guy who sometimes went undrafted. He needs to be rostered folks. He is surrounded by weapons while himself being a \"weapon\" at times too.</p>\n<p>Naz Reid 25pts, 4threes, 8rebs, 1ast, 2stls. He shot 71%. Is that going to continue? No. But the rebs, the threes are a \"normalish\" part of his game/upside. Lots and lots of managers will chase this game expecting similar, but it's far more likely he gets around 20 mins and all of his numbers come down. (lots of garbage time blowout minutes) Still he is relevant and worthy add mostly as trade value. He was a +30 on the court!!! INCREDIBLE. So not only a good fantasy player, but good NBA player. If there was an injury to one of the twin towers (gobert or towns) he would skyrocket in value. I think more than anything tho you can use this to sell high for a more valuable longer term asset. (People do overreact and have a whole lot of recency bias to a huge game) There will inevitably be some clowns who drop Kessler for Naz Reid. What do you with them is (1. buy them some makeup for halloween) and then target them for trades rest of season. Always be taking notes on opponents tendencies. (fantasy commandment). A manager who dumps top, but temporarily struggling players will likely devalue their players in future slumps so technically \"all of their players\" are up for grabs in future.</p>\n<p>Kyle Anderson just continues to prove time and time again to be valuable, 12pts 5-6FG, 2rebs, 4ast, 2stl. Somehow only 42% rostered on yahoo. Very well rounded game now averaging 53% shooting, 5.5rebs, 4.5ast, 2stls on the season.</p>\n<p>For Heat</p>\n<p>Bam Adebayo 19pts, 7-14FG, 5-10FTM, eek, 3rebs, 2ast, 4 turnovers. Kind of a mid to bad game for him. Don't panic tho unless he continues to get tiny rebs in more games.</p>\n<p>Tyler Herro 22pts onbad 8-23FG, 4threes, 5rebs, 4ast, 0turnovers. Despite the bad shooting still a good game. You don't own Herro for his FG%.</p>\n<p>Jovic got the start and provided 8pts on 50% FG, 2threes, 11rebs, 4ast, 1stl. For a big to get 4ast is intriguing as well his huge rebs. I still think K Love is the likely starter going forward depending if that injury is actually a real injury? Assuming it is Jovic needs to be added if you need REBS. How long are the heat going to remain starting K Love EVEN IF he is healthy? This game appears to show the UPSIDE of Jovic and it's fairly exciting.</p>\n<p>Kyle Lowry still useful 7ast, 4rebs despite bad shooting and 4 turnovers. The key I think are his minutes are still huge at 32. Ahtough usage is low here again. Still probably a fringe player and more of an ast stream as season goes along. He does have the upside to have big games tho (proven over his history) considering his minutes have been high so don't be shocked if he goes off once in a while. I think \"upside streamer\" type? I realize that might be controversial cuz some feel he is washed (and he is hated around fantasy community). I'm not giving up any major assets to obtain him tho (obviously), but if he is a \"throw in\" in a trade that something moderately useful as opposed to another bad/droppable player. Mostly a streamer tho. 27% rostered  on yahoo currently.</p>\n<p>Dru Smith with 4ast, 1stl sorta might be an ast stream to watch.</p>\n<p>76ers vs Raptors</p>\n<p>PHI gets the win and as is usually the case for winning teams they shot significantly better as well as kept turnovers down to only 9.</p>\n<p>Joel Embiid legendary near trouble 34pts, 14-21FG (that extra volume really helps), 5-6 or 83% from the line, 9rebs, 8ast, 1stl, 2blocks, only 1 turnover (extremely good with that high usage).  Hold and Enjoy. With No harden it boosts him.</p>\n<p>Maxey 34pts, 12-20FG, 7threes, 100% FTM, 6rebs, 7ast, 1block. Draft day steal is proving to be far better than his ADP. Buy him if you can as I think he should continue this with harden mess. (maybe not this good of shooting, but still) He got a huge 41mins here too! If harden returns it likely will hurt his value some... IF IF...</p>\n<p>Tobias Harris 15pts, 2rebs, 2ast, 2stl, 2blocks. Classic typical line from him. Gotta like it overall and again saw 36 big mins. Same thing applies, as long as no harden his value rises.</p>\n<p>DeAnthony Melton 2pts, (1-7) 5rebs, 4ast, 1stl, 1blck. I think people will panic on this but you shouldn't. He still gave some counting stats and the minutes were there just struggled with shot. He isn't going to be this bad. You own him mostly for his threes and defense anyway not his PTS scoring. (if you are expecting more pts from him you might need to re assess your team build style/synergy/chemistry)</p>\n<p>Kelly Oubre Jr 18pts, 7-17FG, 80% FTM, 5rebs, 2ast, 3stl. This is the 6th man really worth rostering on this team. The steals are not an aberration for him either. He likely holds top 100ish value all season (maybe higher). But his current rank is 26. So based on that he has to be a sell high. People might give you far better more stable players than he is.</p>\n<p>Pat Beverley got 2ast and 5rebs from the guard spot on a back to back. He didn't hurt you shooting 2pts, 1-2. Just want to notate that as an advice for future, cuz he plays again Sunday and might add on more rebs. Thereby making it a unique play for \"out of position\" stats and as a \"desperation rebound stream\" IF you have extra adds and extra spots to be able to perform that stunt (some weeks this might occur). (Like for instance only a guard spot is \"empty\" on your roster for that day/next day and you need rebs in your matchup, he would be someone to consider as an option. Hope that makes sense? He typically provides some defense too so that's what I mean by streaming useful. (I almost streamed him in for the SAT/SUN back to back) I debated deleting or even writing about beverley, but there are useful tidbits in this paragraph.</p>\n<p>For Raptors</p>\n<p>Scottie Barnes 24pts 11-16FG, 8rebs, 5ast, 2blocks, 1turnover. (somehow 2threes as well) Not known for being a 3 point shooter. Value keeps going up and up. Of course no OG here helped him do more, but that shooting can't continue that high? Even still he contributes ALL OVER THE PLACE. He may return 2nd round value all season IF he shoots threes well. I believe he is a buy. You will want to have scottie barnes. Even if you overpay it might be worth it. His only real downside is FT%.</p>\n<p>Dennis Schroeder 15pts, 35% shooting, 4threes, 4rebs, 10ast, 2stl. Another guy underrated at draft. Hold.</p>\n<p>Poetl 6pts, 7rebs, 3ast, 1block. It's again worrisome cuz apparently he is losing time to precious achiuwa?!? What on earth is the coach doing?!? Nick Nurse would have played Poeltl 35 mins!? don't panic yet tho. Still hold. Might even be buy super low?</p>\n<p>Gary Trent Jr with increased usage with no OG, still did what he usually does. Score, hit some threes, get a steal. 17pts, 3threes, 2rebs, 1stl.</p>\n<p>Precious Aichuwa again with 7rebs, but only shot 30% on 10 shots so he helps yet hurts you (never been a high FG% guy). RebsStream</p>\n<p>Grady Dick 16pts, 4threes. most of his playing time came because of the OG injury. (GTJ slides in as starter, Dick gets the 6th man role) Nice to see him do well, but it's PTS/THREES main cats he provides it would seem? (that's his scouting profile) Don't be chasing this unless OG is out longer?</p>\n<p>Pacers vs Cavs</p>\n<p>Pacers win by a 12 point margin against a cavs team that is injured all over. A miniscule remarkable 7 turnovers for pacers!! (neither team playing defense? Cavs also only had 6 turnovers).</p>\n<p>Haliburton 21pts, 7-16FG, 4threes, 100% FTM, 8rebs, 13ast, ONE TURNOVER. An assist to turnover ratio of 13! The best point guard in the game ladies and gentlemen! HOLD HOLD HOLD TIGHTLY.</p>\n<p>Myles Turner continues to be very very good this season 20pts, 7-14FG, 100% FTM, 12rebs, 1ast, 2blocks. He contributes in 5 categories! FG%, FT%, PTS, REBS, BLOCKS. I think this another guy you want to have on your teams especially with haliburton at helm.</p>\n<p>Bruce Brown 6pts, 4rebs, 2ast, 1stl. Bad game, but not a drop yet. Still had 32mins.</p>\n<p>Mathurin 13pts, 1ast. Well we are back to square one with Mathurin only scoring points. Only 17 mins for him as Nesmith outplayed him. I wouldn't completely but wouldn't fault you if you moved on either?</p>\n<p>Aaron Nesmith 26pts, 10-16FG, 5threes, 9rebs. You don't chase this game. You don't get credit for the stats AFTER you add a guy. You need to predict great games BEFORE they occur not react to games AFTER they occur especially if they are unlikely to continue. I just don't think he is going to get this hot again. Good for him though. He is best considered as streamer, but something to monitor IF IF he continues to do this more often, then it would have my attention. We saw this from last year a few times. It looks like McConnell and Hield and Nembhard were all setting him up very well (16ast from them combined) in addition to some ast from haliburton. One thing rookie fantasy managers like to do is overvalue points scoring though so you could use this as \"trade bait\" to dangle the cookie into a lesser skilled manager in your league who might give up a better asset that either fits your build or team needs. But he should not be viewed as a long term option.</p>\n<p>TJ McConnell as ast streamer had 8 of them here and didn't hurt you with 60% shooting on a few points. Also of note is the zero turnovers. (one of the better passers in the game) This is his upside as a passer. I'm curious that Nembhard also got a bunch of mins. The \"main backup PG\" isn't set on who it is and really both might be relevant at times this season.</p>\n<p>Jalen Smith a helpful 13pts, great (5-7) 6rebs, 3ast.</p>\n<p>For Cavs:</p>\n<p>Evan Mobley filled it up! 33pts, 12/22FG, 80% FTM on 8/10, 14rebs, 3ast, 3blocks. HOLD and enjoy. As long as Jarret Allen out (and with  no mitchell and no garland) he just beasted and feasted!!</p>\n<p>Okorro 11pts, 5rebs, 3ast, 1blck is worth a mention.</p>\n<p>Caris Levert 31pts, 12-28FG, 4threes, only 33% FTM, 5rebs, 8ast, 1stl. He has got to be added after this. Holds value as a 6th man when dudes are healthy, but when they are out we see his upside (especially in a punt FT% build). You sell as high as you can on him though cuz can we expect more games like this? ONCE OR IF Mitchell and Garland are back? But the key word is IF healthy so based on that he needs to be scooped up. Only 26% rostered? Far too low. Scoop him folks. He should be held as long as they are out and then traded/flipped once/if/when they are healthy. He typically will harm your FG% tho.</p>\n<p>Max Strus 21pts, 4threes, 11rebs, 6ast. Similar to levert, he has upside CLEARLY with all these injuries. Looks at those rebounds and ast! Especially rebs now averaging 9.5 on season. The question is who will be the one to remain in the starting lineup when all them are healthy? I do think that answer is Strus. Such a massive jump from last year to this year many people would declare \"sell high\", but I'm not so certain... The dude is a hustler... I heard he was constantly training and in the weight room this offseason too (and he practices hardcore) so these big rebounds are a likely result of that extra muscle and tenacity/drive...</p>\n<p>Knicks vs Pelicans</p>\n<p>36% is what the knicks shot. TERRIBLE. Can't win a ball game shooting like that, plus 18 turnovers. Yuck. Julius Randle big reason for that with 8. This might be controversial to knicks fans, but I think Julius is a problem and they lose because of him. From his bad shooting, to his high turnovers, to his poor free throws and his lack of defense. He is just completely overrated as a basketball player and as a fantasy player. (-11 as well) If Knicks trade him away they instantly become better. I truly believe that.</p>\n<p>Julius Randle 10pts, 12rebs, 4ast, 4-15 FG. Refer to what I said above. He did hit 2/2FTM. Small clap. And the PTS, REBS, AST do paly well in PTS leagues. He is a vastly different player in PTS vs CATS leagues. Terrible in CATS, darn near elite in PTS. The fact that remains a thing makes me question the validity of the scoring in PTS leagues? Since how well they perform in NBA should be reflected as to how good they are in fantasy (but that's a whole other conversation). Are standard points leagues overvaluing PTS, REBS and AST? Hmmm</p>\n<p>RJ Barrett 18pts, (7/16) 3rebs, 2ast, 1blck, typical RJ Barret fashion mostly scored points and not much else. Similar to Randle he is not that good of a category league player. (PTS leagues different story)</p>\n<p>Jalen Brunson 14pts, 4/14FG, 5/6FTM, 4rebs, 5ast, only one turnover. Not a terrible game other than bad shooting. What made me shy away from brunson at draft too was lack of defensive stats and we see here also none.</p>\n<p>Mitchell Robinson. He can play all the defense for the team right? lol (and he kind of can). 8pts, 50% FG, 15rebs, 1stl, 2blocks. Another huge game for him especially for those who punt points.</p>\n<p>Josh Hart 10rebs, but shot only 20%. 2ast, 1stl. He is starting to feel like an iffy fringe player? I did have to cut him in a league, but may look to re add him cuz big rebs from the guard spot are rare. Which is THIS GUY as a meme. Not Patrick Beverly, but JOSH HART. Anywho...</p>\n<p>Divincenzo with 4rebs, 2steals, keep in mind as streamer.</p>\n<p>For Pelicans</p>\n<p>Zion 24pts, 12/17 FG, (wow) only 5rebs, 2ast, 1stl. Exactly what you drafted him for. The lower rebs and ast are not ideal tho. Again one of those weird situations where \"better in a pts league\" type of thing.</p>\n<p>Ingram 26pts, 11/17 FG (wow), 7rebs, 3ast, 1stl, but did have 5 bad turnovers. An asset like ingram is the kind of player I refer to when I talk about selling high on other guys. People still think he is \"injury prone\" and love to hate on him regardless of a big game. His \"market value\" is lower than his stat value. And his high turnovers also decrease his \"rank\"/stat value. It is alarmingly high with 5 in each of his games now, but if you punt that you care less about it.</p>\n<p>Herb Jones 10pts, 3blocks. This is why you roster him. Yup. If you punt PTS or AST those teams really love herb jones.</p>\n<p>Jonas V 8pts, 4rebs. I think the pelicans were way ahead so don't make too much of this. Should \"rebound\" next game. (pun intended).</p>\n<p>CJ McCollum 12pts on bad shooting 4-11, 50% from line, 3rebs, but helped extra with 7ast, 4stls. A fine line despite shooting bad. Hold.</p>\n<p>Larry Nance Jr. 0pts, 6rebs, 1blck (desperation rebs streamer)</p>\n<p>Dyson Daniels I'm going to mention with 4rebs, 3ast, 1stl in 22 minutes despite terrible 1/7 shooting. He is the current backup PG and should be for the next 3 weeks or so with alvarado out. Keep an eye on and use for streaming maybe?</p>\n<p>Grizzlies vs Wizards</p>\n<p>Well well what a shocker Grizzlies lose their 3rd game in a row... Bit of an upset too against Wizards who mostly won this game because of a few less turnovers and less fouls. That's what stands out.</p>\n<p>Desmond Bane got back on track with 26pts, 10/20FG, 4threes, 2rebs, 5ast, 1stl, 1block, however 5 turnovers. I expected him to shine early on in season with no JA. Keep holding cuz even bigger games are ahead...</p>\n<p>Jackson Jr 16pts, 4/12FG, 2threes, 100% FTM, 5rebs, 2ast, 1stl, 1blck. 33% and 5rebs from a starting PF? Eek. (one of the reasons I didn't particular like him at his ADP, but he still fits some punting FG%, REBS, builds) There are still some good things to like here, but yeah this is simply a bad game. Don't panic tho.</p>\n<p>Xavier Tillman 8pts, 7rebs, 3ast. The low usage and lack of defensive stats are noticeable, (plus only 24mins? must have been foul trouble?) but you continue to hold. Too much rebs/ast/stl upside.</p>\n<p>Marcus Smart 9pts, 50% FG, 4rebs, 6ast, 2stls, 2blcks. Defensive player of the year proving WHY he is valuable right here! He isn't going to be a major scorer though folks (you likely knew that).</p>\n<p>Zaire Williams 16pts, (6/14), 4threes, 10rebs, 1ast. Whoa. Big time rebs from a SF. He is the current guy getting mins at SF. I do not know if that will continue, but he is at least doing one thing ELITE (reb) so that likely remains him as the starter? In 2 games tho we have seen no defensive stats so that's a concern hindering his upside? Also he shot terrible last game. So jury is still out on what type of player he is/will be sorta...</p>\n<p>David Roddy 14pts, 3threes, 6rebs, 2ast, 1block. I wonder if this can continue? (I want to see more before adding)</p>\n<p>John Konchar 5pts, (2/4FG), 9rebs, 1ast, 2stl, 2blocks. Dude appears to be a great defender. (we saw this last year with him too in some stretches). REBS, STLS, BLOCKS in 2 games are alarmingly high. Only 2 percent rostered. He isn't scoring you points, but if at some point Williams struggles at SF it's possible Konchar steps in there? And even if not it appears he is quality 6th man. He isn't going to score many points (never has been), but yeah some defense and rebounding appeal here. For those about to punt I salute you.</p>\n<p>Derrick Rose wtih 7pts, 5ast, 1stl, 1blck. An ast streamer mostly.</p>\n<p>For Wizards</p>\n<p>Jordan Poole 27pts, (8-23) yuck, 4threes, 77% FTM, 4rebs, 2ast, 1stl, 1block, 5 bad turnovers. Hey if you design a team with Poole, Randle, Kuzma, RJ Barret, Westbrook you would be an elite PTS league team, but a terrible category league team. LOL. This is going to be the kind of games Poole does plenty of (although higher FTM). Like I was saying preseason I think he fits punt FG%, punt Turnovers type of builds. Load up on the small man stats and then find a 5th category to win. But yeah it helped wizards win so it can't be all that bad entirely. I still think he returns around top 40ish to 60ish value (depending on how many turnovers and how many ast he has)</p>\n<p>Kyle Kuzma 21pts, (9/23FG), 66% FTM, 13rebs, 2ast, 1stl, and amazingly zero turnovers. Credit to him for a great game. This is the sort of upside he has albeit hurting your FG%. His rank will fly up if he keeps those turnovers low. Do I think he will? nah history says no. (jeez last game he had zero turnovers too, interesting development) Hmmm.</p>\n<p>Tyus Jones 14pts, (41% FG), 4threes, 2rebs, 7ast, 2stl, 0turnovers. Tyus will have MANY more games EXACTLY like this. This is the Tyus Jones special!!! (well maybe the threes are a bit high), but yup high ast with low turnovers and contributes elsewhere. Underrated darling!</p>\n<p>Dan Gafford 10pts, 75% FG, 66% FTM, 11rebs, 2blocks. Back in the saddle. Bounces back from bad last game. Still might be a buy low considering his last game? Someone recently dangled Gafford and Okongwu for my Tre Jones to me (I'm still debating it).</p>\n<p>Deni Avjija 10pts, 50%, 2threes, 6rebs, 2ast, 2stl. nice useful game but he isn't a big time scorer, will contribute elsewhere tho. (He also didn't hurt you with his shooting) Great defender, great passer, great rebounder. For those about to punt I salute you.</p>\n<p>Corey Kispert 22pts, (8/14) 5threes, 3rebs, 1ast. He got on fire. He is capable of this. I do think it's possible he sees time at starting SF instead of Deni Avjija, but either way Kispert will see extra playing time when he gets fire like this, however that just means you DON'T CHASE this game. Mostly a threes and pts sreamer when schedule dictates. No need to overeact to it unless (as mentioned before) you plan on targeting weaker managers for trades.</p>\n<p>Delon Wright 2pts, (0-3FG), 2/2FTM, 2rebs, 7ast, 2stl, 1blck. Good game.  He should  be rostered in some builds for his ability to get AST and STLS, but does hurt your FG%.</p>\n<p>Pistons vs Bulls</p>\n<p>Blowout loss for bulls because Pistons shot lights out 52%!</p>\n<p>Jalen Duren!!! 23pts, 9/11FG, 5/5 FTM, 15rebs, 5ast, 1stl, 2blcks. ELITE. He is literally looking like a FIRST ROUND TALENT. This doesn't shock me at all. I had him as one of my options on draft day, but never actually ended up with him, sad. Just keep on enjoying this. He is not a sell high. HOLD. Check out those 5ast too?!? And perfect from the line?!? My gosh!! All of the upside in the world is developing/showing itself right in front of us. Vucevic for Duren, yup get rid of Vuc. (doubt they accept tho) All kinds of other similar trade moves. For those about to trade I salute you! This is someone you WANT TO HAVE. Absolutely, like wow!</p>\n<p>Cade Cunningham. I started with Duren cuz Cade had 6 turnovers and I want to mention that first. It's an iffy negative that must be considered despite the huge game, 25pts, 9/19FG, 6/7FTM, 4rebs, 10ast. Still this is huge! Another guy to target in trades esp if you are punting turnovers.</p>\n<p>Ausar Thompson 9pts, 12rebs, 5ast, 1stl, 1blck displaying a versatile all around game as a defender, rebounder, playmaker! This is why he was on people's sleeper lists. (almost everyone). I'm shocked at how he elite he is rebounding thus far. That has to come down to a more normal number I would think? He is only shooting 26% in 3 games now tho, so there are clear downsides, turnovers also a bit high? He still could be a bit of a buy low for those who don't see beyond \"rank\" (he is only ranked 112) or if you are punting specific things (like PTS or FG%). If he somehow figures out his shot WATCH OUT. Upside TO THE MOON. Of course let's calm down the hype train, that remains an IF scenario. Factually right now he has weaknesses.</p>\n<p>Killian Hayes 4ast, 1stl. 6pts, 2threes. Only 23 mins?</p>\n<p>Isiah Stewart is slightly useful player in some builds... 14pts, (6/14FG), 9rebs. Not much defense here but for pts and rebs you can do worse. I do fear he lacks overall upside considering his lack of defense.</p>\n<p>Alec Burks continues to be the 6th man scoring option 18pts, 50% FG, 6threes, 2rebs, 1block. No sign his role changing so he can be rostered for those he need PTS and THREES and FT% (holy trinity of little men? Or is that PTS, THREES, AST? Debate in the comments)</p>\n<p>Marvin Bagley III 11pts, 6rebs a useful rebs stream at times this season.</p>\n<p>For the Bulls:</p>\n<p>Zachary Thomas Lavine! Holy Macaroni! 51pts on 19/33, (57%) 75% from the line (iffy), 7threes, 4rebs, 1stl, 4 turnovers. (controversial comment alert) Well on second look it's a massive scoring night, but he didn't do much else and did have 4 turnovers? Still can't take this away from him and it's great! FG%, PTS, THREES, are those main THREE categories that THIS particular game boosts you in. (75% from line isn't that great) That's kind of what I mean by he didn't do much else? The strongest fantasy performers in a category league boost you in 4 or 5 sometimes even 6 categories, but those are SUPER RARE to have games with elite performances across the board like that and it typically happens with 1st or 2nd or 3rd round players more than others.... Still this big scoring game was nice huge bounce back game from when he struggled massively in last one. Because of the overall things I have mentioned though I do think he is a sell high. Plenty often the usage will fluctuate between him and Demar DeRozan. You hold in a PTS league (cuz again that style of paly favors PTS enormously).</p>\n<p>DeRozan 20pts, 7/13FG, 85% FTM, 2rebs, 4ast, 1stl, 2blocks, only 1 turnover. Carry on with your usual self sir. Typical mid range master. The steal and 2 blocks are a nice little bonus here!</p>\n<p>Vucevic 12pts, 4rebs (4 only?), 1ast. Can you do more please? Yikes.</p>\n<p>Coby White 0pts, 0/4, 2rebs, 1ast. Yikes. I don't think you need to hold, but then again he very well could bounce back with a nice game in the next one. In his defense you don't shoot the ball when Lavine is on fire like he was so that explain the tiny usage of 4 shots. (why I say the best dude for this offense was lonzo ball darn it, still sad he got hurt, he was a great passer to those high usage good shooters!) Coby is not that great of a passer, prob good/moderate. Also is now 27% FG on the season. Can't get married (can drop) to fringe players like Coby White folks...</p>\n<p>Andre Drummond per minute production real nice in punt PTS builds, 5rebs, 2ast, 3stl, 1block in only 14 mins, but did struggle shooting 1/6.</p>\n<p>Alex Caruso, 2pts on 50%FG, 5rebs, 4ast, 4steals, 1blocks. He should  be rostered for his ELITE defense and is \"must roster\" IF IF you are punting PTS. I do ponder if Caruso/White is a positional battle? He helps you right now in 4 categories: AST, STL, BLOCK, TO and technically doesn't hurt you in FG%, *chefs kiss* so THAT ladies and gentlemen is how you COOK fantasy wins IF punting pts.</p>\n<p>----</p>\n<p>Now if you want a condensed version just copy/paste sections into Chat GPT... (It was too long and chat gpt couldn't properly condense all of it, plus to be honest I don't truly like it condensed?)</p>\n<p>-----</p>\n<p>I'm aware that most of this is just the stats. But I think that's important because some/many fantasy managers lack a basic awareness of the facts/stats (especially for players we do not own) So it's good to remind ourselves of what those are! I tried to add a few extra things other than just the stats. I know it might be \"too wordy\"? Trying to get better at this without being too robotic/boring or tough to read...</p>\n<p>What are YOUR takeaways. Things you noticed when you watched the games or disagree with some of the things I have said? I don't want this to just be \"my takeaways\", I'd like for some of you to add on please!

            "content_html": "<caption>Open: <a href='apollo://www.reddit.com/r/fantasybball/comments/17j0m0x/pascal_not_so_spicy_p_siakim/'>Apollo</a> | <a href='https://reddit.com/r/fantasybball/comments/17j0m0x/pascal_not_so_spicy_p_siakim/'>Reddit</a></caption><div><br></div><p>If you\u2019re like me and were hoping Pascal would come out the gates spicy (ok, I\u2019ll stop lol), you\u2019ve been a bit disappointed. Tried to catch some of the game and did some research too. Here\u2019s what I got:</p>\n<p>The stats part:</p>\n<p>In the first 3 games, Pascal has averaged 14.7pts, 7.3 rebs, 4 ast, .3 blks, .3 stls on 37.5% fg%, 40% 3% and 72.7% from the FT line. So what\u2019s going on.</p>\n<p>His rebounds are very similar to his avg over the past 3 years (7.8 avg rebs), while his avg assists of 4 are down by about 1 assist per game (5.2 avg ast per game over the past 3 years). As steals and blocks can vary dramatically over a short period of time, I didn\u2019t look at that too heavily, but they are down a little bit compared to the past 3 year avgs of 1.1 steals and .6 blocks. </p>\n<p>This is the not so spicy part. Currently his PPG of 14.7 is down significantly compared to the past 3 year (21.4pts, 22.8pts, and 24.2pts per game) from 20-21 season through 22-23 season, respectively. This is partially due to his fg% dropping this year to 37.5% from his of average of 47.6% across the past 3 years I noted above.</p>\n<p>Well, is Pascal still taking the same amount of shots this year, you may ask? In the first 2 games, Pascal still averaged 16 FGA, which is comparable to his average FGA across the past 3 seasons of 17.8 FGA. Although, the 3rd game is a bit of an outlier as he only took 8 shots. So kinda. (Did wanna note that the 2nd game went into overtime and Pascal did take 1 shot that he missed, so that OT period did not effect his average FGA above dramatically)</p>\n<p>His FTs are also a bit out of wack. As he is shooting 72.7% from the strip this year compared to his 3 year avg of 78.3%. His attempts at the line are also down, this year he\u2019s at 3.7 attempts, while in the past three years he averaged 5.9 attempts.</p>\n<p>Clearly, Pascal is in a bit of a slump. Assuming, the first two games, where he had 16 FGA is closer to realistic compared to the 8 shots in the 3rd game, Pascal has room to step back into his 20+ ppg avg. If he can raise his fg% back up and also increase his ft% and raise his ft attempts back up as well. Assuming the rest of his stats remain similar YOY.</p>\n<p>Ascension/hot streak of Scottie \u201cBugatti\u201d Barnes:</p>\n<p>After catching parts of the past 2 games, I gotta say, Scottie looks very good and extremely confident! Had to go back and watch some of his highlights from last year and I think he worked really hard in the offseason on his shooting form. And it looks like it\u2019s paying dividends as his turn around jumper/3pt shot look smooth! No more weird hitch/wonky release. Which has translated to increasing his fg% and 3pt % to 50% and 33% respectively. Add this to his usual ultra aggressive attacks to the rim/post ups with plenty of kick outs to open shooters when the double comes, makes him deadly from the inside out. Small sample size, but I definitely think Scottie\u2019s shooting form improved and he will seek to take more shots this year because of this.</p>\n<p>I say all that about Scottie because I think the ball will be in his hands even more this year then in previous years as he seems to be taking a leap on the offensive end. In turn, this could hurt Pascal\u2019s production over the season. It could also help Scottie spread the floor too when Pascal has the ball. Gotta see more games to really know for sure.</p>\n<p>New coach in town:</p>\n<p>Tbh, haven\u2019t watched a lotta Raptors games in the past few years, so not exactly sure how/if new coaching regime has changed things up, but this could also effect Pascal. If someone with more knowledge can comment below on this, I\u2019d appreciate it!</p>\n<p>Tl;Dr - Pascal is in a shooting slump and should improve, but if Scottie\u2019s new and improved shooting form is legit, could that take shots/offensive possessions away from Pascal or could this help space the floor for him, making a devastating one two punch of Spicy P and Scottie Bugatti? </p>\n<p>Let me know what you guys think!</p>",
