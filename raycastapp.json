I've explored all the available extensions and tried out a bunch of them. I've stopped using Magnet, Bartender, Color Picker; it's all set up inside Raycast now, and it has completely changed the way I use my Mac.</p>\n<p>Last month, I redeemed a trial code to try out the Pro features. At first, I didn't think it was worth it. For example, I had the Gemini extension with a free API key and an alias of \"ai,\" so all I had to do was type \"ai\" and hit tab to access quick AI. But after a while, it felt so natural to just hit tab and start typing. Plus, Gemini was taking a while to process.</p>\n<p>Another feature I tried was commands, and wow, that was the feature I definitely used the most. I'm learning Spanish with online classes and I've created some commands to translate quickly and conjugate verbs in specific tenses. It really helps me stay focused on the class instead of browsing the web for translations.</p>\n<p>With the addition of presets, I've created presets for work (software development) and to help me with Spanish exercises.</p>\n<p>So last week, my trial ended and I decided not to subscribe. But now, I'm starting to rethink it. I find myself constantly writing something and pressing tab only to see that \"Raycast AI is for pro users only\" message. Now that I\u2019m back using ChatGPT online, it's awful; it's so slow, and most of all, I miss having my Spanish exercise setup with presets and commands.</p>\n<p>Well, I'm not 100% certain that I will subscribe, but right now I'm very inclined towards it.</p>",

However, in recent months, it seems that the team has made a drastic shift in their priorities, pouring all their resources into introducing new AI-driven features (only for Pro subscribers) while neglecting to address the lingering bug reports that have been plaguing other aspects of the app.</p>\n<p>It's become increasingly frustrating to see critical issues persist despite multiple attempts to report them. The lack of attention to these fundamental problems has led me to question the team's commitment to delivering a seamless user experience. As someone who relies heavily on Raycast for daily tasks, I find it disconcerting that my trust in the app is being eroded by the constant barrage of technical issues.</p>\n<p>Moreover, as an individual with multiple AI subscription services, I've grown tired of the emphasis on AI-driven features within Raycast. While these innovations may be exciting to some, they're not what drew me to this platform initially. I wanted a reliable and user-friendly tool that could help me streamline my workflow, not a constant stream of new bells and whistles.</p>\n<p>It's time for the Raycast team to refocus on addressing the long-standing issues that have been holding users like myself back from fully utilizing their app. Until then, I'm left with no choice but to explore alternative solutions that prioritize stability and reliability over flashy AI features.</p>\n<p>PS: I used my other AI subscriptions to convey what I wanted to say more politely. See? No need for Raycast AI...</p>",
