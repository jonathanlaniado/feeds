I'm the developer of the raycast-g4f extension. It provides AI functionality completely for free, sourcing its output from a variety of third-party providers. I strongly believe that such AI features, especially in an awesome productivity tool like Raycast, shouldn't be locked behind a paywall; I might not be able to compete with every single thing the paid version offers, but I\u2019m confident that what I provide is still valuable and can be incredibly useful for your daily tasks.</p>\n<p>Note: I've shared this same extension a little over a month ago, but I've been working on it a lot since then and made some huge improvements, so I thought it would be nice to share it again!</p>\n<p>Source code: <a href=\"https://github.com/XInTheDark/raycast-g4f/\">https://github.com/XInTheDark/raycast-g4f/</a> . Installation is very simple and the steps are displayed on the home page.</p>\n<p>I'm also more than happy to answer any questions/feedback/reservations you have regarding the extension! Just comment below and I'll respond.</p>\n<p>Lastly, to all of the 40 stars that light up my project on GitHub: if you're reading this, thank you so much for trying out my extension! Your support means the world to me &lt;3</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Some FAQs</em></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Why is this extension not on the official Raycast store?</li>\n<li>I submitted it when the extension was in its early stages, but since Raycast is quite conservative about adding AI extensions, it was rejected because of concerns over the use of third-party APIs. I think this is a valid concern, and I'd like to be very transparent about where your data is going to, so I'll be writing all the details in the project homepage really soon. But do rest assured that I use safe APIs from legitimate websites; I also update the extension very frequently so all the providers I use will be up-to-date.</li>\n<li>Thus, the extension will have to be installed from source. Regarding this, I apologize as it's indeed more complicated than downloading it from the store. I have tried my best to make the installation process quick and streamlined - please do provide feedback on whether it was simple enough!</li>\n<li>How does this extension compare to the paid Raycast AI?</li>\n<li>The biggest difference is probably the chat GUI. Because the developer API that Raycast provides is limited, it's not possible to replicate the Raycast AI interface exactly. The GUI used in my extension is really intuitive however, and it's also used by a lot of AI extensions on raycast.</li>\n<li>Regarding the models available, and the AI quality: Raycast AI definitely has more model options - after all, money talks ;) But please rest assured that the quality of AI responses in my extension is by no means subpar! Some models available are gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4 (authentic!), Google Gemini, as well as large &amp; capable open-source models like Llama3-70B and Mixtral-8x22B. If you still doubt it, I'd encourage you to the extension a try! :-)</li>\n</ol>",

I've explored all the available extensions and tried out a bunch of them. I've stopped using Magnet, Bartender, Color Picker; it's all set up inside Raycast now, and it has completely changed the way I use my Mac.</p>\n<p>Last month, I redeemed a trial code to try out the Pro features. At first, I didn't think it was worth it. For example, I had the Gemini extension with a free API key and an alias of \"ai,\" so all I had to do was type \"ai\" and hit tab to access quick AI. But after a while, it felt so natural to just hit tab and start typing. Plus, Gemini was taking a while to process.</p>\n<p>Another feature I tried was commands, and wow, that was the feature I definitely used the most. I'm learning Spanish with online classes and I've created some commands to translate quickly and conjugate verbs in specific tenses. It really helps me stay focused on the class instead of browsing the web for translations.</p>\n<p>With the addition of presets, I've created presets for work (software development) and to help me with Spanish exercises.</p>\n<p>So last week, my trial ended and I decided not to subscribe. But now, I'm starting to rethink it. I find myself constantly writing something and pressing tab only to see that \"Raycast AI is for pro users only\" message. Now that I\u2019m back using ChatGPT online, it's awful; it's so slow, and most of all, I miss having my Spanish exercise setup with presets and commands.</p>\n<p>Well, I'm not 100% certain that I will subscribe, but right now I'm very inclined towards it.</p>",

What I found really powerful was the \"do something with the text I selected\" feature, but $8 a month seems expensive for the features on top of the free plan.</p>\n<p>Are you satisfied with Raycast Pro? Do you feel the $8/month is worth it?\nThanks!</p>",
