I read through the privacy policy and it seems fine, but before I get too deep (and possibly go pro/ai) I just wanted to check:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If I enable search files to cover \"name &amp; contents\" does all the indexing and search results remain local? I think the answer is it's fine, but just want to be sure I'm not enabling all my data to end up on a server. </li>\n<li>Does this change if I use pro sync?</li>\n<li>Can extensions from the store be trusted - do they get checked before being allowed in the store? If extensions have the same permissions of raycast, is there a risk of an extension having access to all my file contents/system and being used maliciously?</li>\n<li>If I use the pro+AI extension, my understanding is that raycast servers don't record the interaction, and it's a matter for OpenAI/Anthropic/etc policies. Is that correct? and if so, is there a way to ensure that data is not used by them for training, the way I can do when I use them with a direct subscription?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Thanks</p>",

I mean, you get the same GPT-4o that's already free to use in OpenAI's app? Or via DuckDuckGo, or via gazillion third-party interfaces? Why would you pay for that?</p>\n<p>In my opinion, a much better value would be a $4 plan, without AI at all. Just Raycast features (sync, themes, unlimited clipboard, custom window management, floating notes, etc).</p>\n<p>Because, I can see two use-cases:  </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Users paying for AI. They're going to decide on either ChatGPT Plus or Raycast PRO + Advanced AI.  </li>\n<li>Users not paying for AI. They would really benefit from the proposed $4 plan (for sync and notes, let's say). They already have that GPT-4o mini.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I guess my question is, who is $8 plan for? Are you using it (for AI)? Would you like it to go $4 and lose AI window access?</p>",

The very ideas at the core of Sublime were developed through years of writing and conversations with readers that confirmed my hunches weren\u2019t crazy.

I'm the developer of the raycast-g4f extension. It provides AI functionality completely for free, sourcing its output from a variety of third-party providers. I strongly believe that such AI features, especially in an awesome productivity tool like Raycast, shouldn't be locked behind a paywall; I might not be able to compete with every single thing the paid version offers, but I\u2019m confident that what I provide is still valuable and can be incredibly useful for your daily tasks.</p>\n<p>Note: I've shared this same extension a little over a month ago, but I've been working on it a lot since then and made some huge improvements, so I thought it would be nice to share it again!</p>\n<p>Source code: <a href=\"https://github.com/XInTheDark/raycast-g4f/\">https://github.com/XInTheDark/raycast-g4f/</a> . Installation is very simple and the steps are displayed on the home page.</p>\n<p>I'm also more than happy to answer any questions/feedback/reservations you have regarding the extension! Just comment below and I'll respond.</p>\n<p>Lastly, to all of the 40 stars that light up my project on GitHub: if you're reading this, thank you so much for trying out my extension! Your support means the world to me &lt;3</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Some FAQs</em></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Why is this extension not on the official Raycast store?</li>\n<li>I submitted it when the extension was in its early stages, but since Raycast is quite conservative about adding AI extensions, it was rejected because of concerns over the use of third-party APIs. I think this is a valid concern, and I'd like to be very transparent about where your data is going to, so I'll be writing all the details in the project homepage really soon. But do rest assured that I use safe APIs from legitimate websites; I also update the extension very frequently so all the providers I use will be up-to-date.</li>\n<li>Thus, the extension will have to be installed from source. Regarding this, I apologize as it's indeed more complicated than downloading it from the store. I have tried my best to make the installation process quick and streamlined - please do provide feedback on whether it was simple enough!</li>\n<li>How does this extension compare to the paid Raycast AI?</li>\n<li>The biggest difference is probably the chat GUI. Because the developer API that Raycast provides is limited, it's not possible to replicate the Raycast AI interface exactly. The GUI used in my extension is really intuitive however, and it's also used by a lot of AI extensions on raycast.</li>\n<li>Regarding the models available, and the AI quality: Raycast AI definitely has more model options - after all, money talks ;) But please rest assured that the quality of AI responses in my extension is by no means subpar! Some models available are gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4 (authentic!), Google Gemini, as well as large &amp; capable open-source models like Llama3-70B and Mixtral-8x22B. If you still doubt it, I'd encourage you to the extension a try! :-)</li>\n</ol>",

I've explored all the available extensions and tried out a bunch of them. I've stopped using Magnet, Bartender, Color Picker; it's all set up inside Raycast now, and it has completely changed the way I use my Mac.</p>\n<p>Last month, I redeemed a trial code to try out the Pro features. At first, I didn't think it was worth it. For example, I had the Gemini extension with a free API key and an alias of \"ai,\" so all I had to do was type \"ai\" and hit tab to access quick AI. But after a while, it felt so natural to just hit tab and start typing. Plus, Gemini was taking a while to process.</p>\n<p>Another feature I tried was commands, and wow, that was the feature I definitely used the most. I'm learning Spanish with online classes and I've created some commands to translate quickly and conjugate verbs in specific tenses. It really helps me stay focused on the class instead of browsing the web for translations.</p>\n<p>With the addition of presets, I've created presets for work (software development) and to help me with Spanish exercises.</p>\n<p>So last week, my trial ended and I decided not to subscribe. But now, I'm starting to rethink it. I find myself constantly writing something and pressing tab only to see that \"Raycast AI is for pro users only\" message. Now that I\u2019m back using ChatGPT online, it's awful; it's so slow, and most of all, I miss having my Spanish exercise setup with presets and commands.</p>\n<p>Well, I'm not 100% certain that I will subscribe, but right now I'm very inclined towards it.</p>",

However, in recent months, it seems that the team has made a drastic shift in their priorities, pouring all their resources into introducing new AI-driven features (only for Pro subscribers) while neglecting to address the lingering bug reports that have been plaguing other aspects of the app.</p>\n<p>It's become increasingly frustrating to see critical issues persist despite multiple attempts to report them. The lack of attention to these fundamental problems has led me to question the team's commitment to delivering a seamless user experience. As someone who relies heavily on Raycast for daily tasks, I find it disconcerting that my trust in the app is being eroded by the constant barrage of technical issues.</p>\n<p>Moreover, as an individual with multiple AI subscription services, I've grown tired of the emphasis on AI-driven features within Raycast. While these innovations may be exciting to some, they're not what drew me to this platform initially. I wanted a reliable and user-friendly tool that could help me streamline my workflow, not a constant stream of new bells and whistles.</p>\n<p>It's time for the Raycast team to refocus on addressing the long-standing issues that have been holding users like myself back from fully utilizing their app. Until then, I'm left with no choice but to explore alternative solutions that prioritize stability and reliability over flashy AI features.</p>\n<p>PS: I used my other AI subscriptions to convey what I wanted to say more politely.
