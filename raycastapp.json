The lack of attention to these fundamental problems has led me to question the team's commitment to delivering a seamless user experience. As someone who relies heavily on Raycast for daily tasks, I find it disconcerting that my trust in the app is being eroded by the constant barrage of technical issues.</p>\n<p>Moreover, as an individual with multiple AI subscription services, I've grown tired of the emphasis on AI-driven features within Raycast. While these innovations may be exciting to some, they're not what drew me to this platform initially. I wanted a reliable and user-friendly tool that could help me streamline my workflow, not a constant stream of new bells and whistles.</p>\n<p>It's time for the Raycast team to refocus on addressing the long-standing issues that have been holding users like myself back from fully utilizing their app. Until then, I'm left with no choice but to explore alternative solutions that prioritize stability and reliability over flashy AI features.</p>\n<p>PS: I used my other AI subscriptions to convey what I wanted to say more politely. See? No need for Raycast AI...</p>",
