During this time, I also experimented with GitHub Copilot in VSCode, but initially found it less satisfying because of GPT-3 (or 3.5 don\u2018t bash me), which seemed like a step down in all aspects.</p>\n<p>However, things have changed significantly recently. Copilot has been upgraded to GPT-4, introducing a ChatGPT-like interface that allows for more interactive coding. By initiating prompts with \"@workspace [prompt...]\", Copilot can now access the entire context of your project.</p>\n<p>This feature enables you to give commands like \"apply this logic in this or that file\u201c and it seamlessly executes them, searching through all references in the project. No more copying and pasting large code blocks into ChatGPT, streamlining the development process considerably.</p>\n<p>Also the way how you can hover over errors in your code and apply quick fixes for them. Such a time saver.</p>\n<p>I've been extremely pleased with these updates. They've transformed my coding experience, making it way more efficient and enjoyable. I'll probably cancel my GPT-4 subscription since the capabilities of Copilot are insane now!</p>\n<p>If you want to see it in action watch <a href=\"https://youtu.be/2qwiNmBNqQQ?si=3CP48p7z4APFL0y2\">Theo\u2018s recent video</a>.</p>\n<p>Edit: It seems like the subscription page for Copilot still says GPT 3.5, you need to join the public beta and manually update VSCode + Copilot for the new features and GPT-4 access. <a href=\"https://github.blog/changelog/2023-11-30-github-copilot-november-30th-update/\">Reference source</a></p>",

And my favorite one is using it for job interviews.</p>\n<p>If you are out of the loop, ChatGPT has an Android &amp; iPhone app that since recently has <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-can-now-see-hear-and-speak\">ChatGPT voice</a>. This is not just simple voice commands, you can actually talk to ChatGPT with a very realistic voice. And it's 100% free. </p>\n<p>To turn ChatGPT into a recruiter that will conduct the interview, we first have to explain the setting. You don't have to start with a voice conversation, you can also prompt via text and then start the voice conversation. </p>\n<p><strong>Prompt ChatGPT</strong></p>\n<p>Use the following prompt to turn ChatGPT into a recruiter and have a good understanding of the company and role you are applying for:</p>\n<p>\"Act like you are a recruiter at [company], hiring for a [job role]. We will have a fictional interview for this role. Don't start the interview till I say I'm ready. Once I'm ready, please start by introducing yourself and the company. Then, proceed to ask me a series of typical interview questions for this position. After the interview is complete, provide comprehensive feedback on my overall performance. Highlight areas where I did well, and offer suggestions on how I can improve my answers and presentation skills for a more effective performance in real interviews.  Here is the complete job vacancy:<br />\n[full vacancy]<br />\nPlease confirm if you understand your assignment\" </p>\n<p>Don't forget to change the placeholders and to copy and paste the full vacancy at the end of the prompt. It's a quick and lazy way to let ChatGPT have a good understanding of what is required in the role and have a more accurate interview.</p>\n<p><strong>Start the voice conversation</strong></p>\n<p>To start the conversation, click on the headphones icons at the bottom right corner and say 'I'm ready to start the interview'. The interview will then begin.</p>\n<p>ChatGPT will ask you a bunch of questions before concluding interview and will provide you comprehensive feedback afterwards. If you prefer, you can also modify the prompt to get feedback after every question, I'll leave that prompt in the comments to not clutter this post too much. </p>\n<p>You can always start over or ask ChatGPT to start concluding the interview if they ask too many questions or if it's becoming to get repetitive. </p>\n<p>Let me know this was for you and if it was helpful! </p>\n<p>Want to learn more about ChatGPT &amp; AI?

I've spent way too much time on ChatGPT the last year and one of my biggest problems was consistency. Sometimes the answers and writing is absolute gold, and the next second it's sh*t. </p>\n<p>Luckily I've documented most of my learnings when things go well and when it goes bad, and that concluded some learnings. I'm not saying this will fix all of your issues, but for me this has led to way better results and consistency, saving me a lot of time and headaches. </p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><strong>1. The RTFC Framework:</strong></p>\n<p>R - Role</p>\n<p>T - Task</p>\n<p>F - Format</p>\n<p>C - Constraints </p>\n<p>The role task format is a pretty classic framework for prompting, but what makes all the difference is constraints. It's hard to say everything it should do, but it's easier to say things it should absolutely not do. For example:</p>\n<p>Act like you are a world-class copywriter with 30 years of experience in copywriting. Write me a cold-email to SaaS CEOs for my experts in plain text between 200 and 300 words.</p>\n<p><strong>Contraints:</strong> </p>\n<p>- Write simple, but not simplistic. The language should be written at a 5th-grade reading level</p>\n<p>- Write with authority </p>\n<p>- Avoid buzzwords and jargon and instead speak plainly.</p>\n<p>- Avoid being salesy or overly enthusiastic and instead express calm confidence. </p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><strong>2. Bring examples</strong></p>\n<p>One of the best things you can do to get good output is to show examples of what you want. The more the better. </p>\n<p>If you show up at the barber it's also easier to show a photo of the haircut that you want than to describe it. For example:</p>\n<p>Write me a cold-email to SaaS CEOs for my experts in plain text between 200 and 300 words. Make it look like this:</p>\n<p>Example 1:</p>\n<p>Example 2:</p>\n<p>And avoid this:<br />\nExample 3:</p>\n<p>Telling ChatGPT what you don't want is also very effective when you showcase examples. You want to refine its playing field, leading more likely to your ideal outcome. </p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><strong>3. Ask it to take it step-by-step</strong></p>\n<p>One of my odd findings was that if you ask ChatGPT to slow down and not rush its job, you get a better outcome. </p>\n<p>Also ask ChatGPT to ask you follow-up questions if it would like more information to understand you, or do its job better. 9/10 ChatGPT will ask you questions that eventually lead to a much better outcome.</p>\n<p><strong>Other tips/observations:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>When your chat becomes too big it's better to start over instead of trying to get the answers you want. There is a higher chance of hallucination and it will take more effort to finetune it. </li>\n<li>You can ask for a summary of the Chat so you don't have to completely start over, but that at least ChatGPT has a fresh start with context. </li>\n<li>In general GPT-4 is smarter but Claude is way better at writing. It writes naturally and engaging. It's hard to make ChatGPT write naturally and engaging, but the insights are mostly on point. So what I usually do is create something first in ChatGPT and then rewrite it in Claude. </li>\n<li>Reasoning ChatGPT &gt; Claude</li>\n<li>Writing Claude &gt; ChatGPT</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Hope you found this useful!

This GPT automates the resume creation/updating process for an optimized acceptance rate.</p>\n<p><strong>The Idea</strong></p>\n<p>I frequently change jobs due to statistically proven benefits.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cAnother one in five of those surveyed saw <strong>pay increases between 10 and 20 percent</strong> when switching companies.\u201d   </p>\n<p>[Source 1]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Every time, I've noticed a recurring theme: the daunting task of updating resumes for multiple job applications. This challenge led me down an interesting path of experimentation, and now, I'm thrilled to announce the public release of my resume creation GPT (alpha). </p>\n<p><strong>GPT:</strong> <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/g/g-mOVLb8GqB-custom-resume\"><strong>https://chat.openai.com/g/g-mOVLb8GqB-custom-resume</strong></a></p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p>\n<p>The process is straightforward and user-friendly. You have two options: start from scratch by having a conversation with the GPT, which guides you through creating a new resume, or upload an existing one for updating in relation to a new job offer. As you interact with the GPT, it tailors your resume accordingly. At the end of the process, you'll receive a secure download link with a password, allowing you to safely download your updated resume.</p>\n<p><strong>Privacy and Data Security</strong> </p>\n<p>Your privacy is a top priority. I do not have access to any of your data. All information is encrypted and stored solely for the purpose of enabling you to download your resume. This data expires and is permanently deleted after three months, in line with my stringent privacy policy, which can be found at<a href=\"https://jobdraft.ai/privacy-policy\"> https://jobdraft.ai/privacy-policy</a></p>\n<p><strong>(Problem) - Seeking Feedback</strong> </p>\n<p>Due to the privacy policy, I cannot access any resume generation data, except for my own tests. This limits my ability to assess the effectiveness of the GPT tool. Therefore, I would greatly appreciate if you could share your experiences, resumes, or other feedback with me directly. Your input is invaluable for improving this tool and validating its utility. </p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><em>Sources:</em> </p>\n<p><em>1-</em> <a href=\"https://ivyexec.com/career-advice/2023/does-job-hopping-really-earn-you-a-higher-salary\"><em>https://ivyexec.com/career-advice/2023/does-job-hopping-really-earn-you-a-higher-salary</em></a> </p>",

We, the employees of OpenAI, have developed the best models and pushed the field to new frontiers. Our work on AI safety and governance shapes global norms. The products we built are used by millions of people around the world. Until now, the company we work for and cherish has never been in a stronger position.  </p>\n<p>The process through which you terminated Sam Altman and removed Greg Brockman from the board has jeopardized all of this work and undermined our mission and company. Your conduct has made it clear you did not have the competence to oversee OpenAI.  </p>\n<p>When we all unexpectedly learned of your decision, the leadership team of OpenAI acted swiftly to stabilize the company. They carefully listened to your concerns and tried to cooperate with you on all grounds. Despite many requests for specific facts for your allegations, you have never provided any written evidence. They also increasingly realized you were not capable of carrying out your duties, and were negotiating in bad faith.  </p>\n<p>The leadership team suggested that the most stabilizing path forward - the one that would best serve our mission, company, stakeholders, employees and the public - would be for you to resign and put in place a qualified board that could lead the company forward in stability.  </p>\n<p>Leadership worked with you around the clock to find a mutually agreeable outcome. Yet within two days of your initial decision, you again replaced interim CEO Mira Murati against the best interests of the company. You also informed the leadership team that allowing the company to be destroyed \u201cwould be consistent with the mission.\u201d  </p>\n<p>Your actions have made it obvious that you are incapable of overseeing OpenAI. We are unable to work for or with people that lack competence, judgement and care for our mission and employees. We, the undersigned, may choose to resign from OpenAI and join the newly announced Microsoft subsidiary run by Sam Altman and Greg Brockman. Microsoft has assured us that there are positions for all OpenAI employees at this new subsidiary should we choose to join. We will take this step imminently, unless all current board members resign, and the board appoints two new lead independent directors, such as Bret Taylor and Will Hurd, and reinstates Sam Altman and Greg Brockman.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>",

We\u2019re all enthusiastic and personally invested in applying cutting edge tech to new product designs. We\u2019re no stranger to implementing automation and software services in our jobs. So why am I the only one who seems to care about ChatGPT?</p>\n<p>I\u2019m, like, offended on ChatGPT (and all LLMs) behalf that my friends, family, and co-workers just don\u2019t seem to grasp the importance of this breakthrough tool. I feel like they treat it like the latest social networking app and they\u2019ll get around to looking at it eventually, once everyone else is using it. I\u2019ve found myself getting to the point of literally yelling (emphatically, not aggressively) at my friends and coworkers to please please please just start playing the free version with it to get comfortable with it. And also give me a good reason why you won\u2019t spend $20 to use the culmination of all of humanity\u2019s technological development\u2026 but you won\u2019t think twice about dropping $17 on a craft beer.</p>\n<p>I told my boss I would pay for a month of Plus subscriptions for my entire team <strong>out of my own pocket</strong> if they\u2019d just promise to try using it (prior to OpenAI halting new Plus accounts this morning). I told him \u201cTHAT\u2019s how enthusiastic I am about them learning to use the tool\u201d, but it was just met with a \u201cwow, you really are excited about this, huh?\u201d</p>\n<p>I proactively asked HR if I could give a company wide presentation on the various ways practical, time saving ways that I\u2019ve been able to utilize ChatGPT with the expressly stated intention of demystifying it and getting coworkers excited to use the tool. I don\u2019t feel like it moved the needle much.</p>\n<p>Even my IT staff are somewhat luke warm on the topic.</p>\n<p>Like, what the hell is going on? Am I (and the rest of us in this sub) really that much of an outlier within the tech community that we\u2019re still considered the early adopters?</p>\n<p>I\u2019m constantly torn between feeling like I\u2019m already behind the curve for not integrating this into my daily life fast enough and feeling like I\u2019m taking crazy pills because people are treating this like some annoying homework that they\u2019ll be forced to figure out against their will someday in the future.</p>\n<p>Now that OpenAI has stopped accepting new Plus accounts, I\u2019ll admit I\u2019m experiencing a bit of schadenfreude. I tried to help them, but they didn\u2019t want to be helped and now they lost their chance. If this pause on new Plus accounts goes on for more than a couple of weeks, it\u2019s going to really widen the gap between those who are fluent with all of the Plus features, and everyone else. </p>\n<p>If we were already the early adopters, we\u2019re about to widen our lead.</p>",

Some of my experiences have me wondering \"What's the point?\"</p>\n<p>While checking out a few of OpenAI's customized GPTs, I asked them relevant, targeted questions and then asked regular ChatGPT4 the same questions.  In some cases, regular ChatGPT4 gave me superior advice than the so-called specialized engines.  Regular ChatGPT4 gave me objectively better advice about getting a stain out (a real problem I have at the moment) than the \"Laundry Buddy\" GPT.</p>\n<p>Then, here's the real kicker, I asked \"Laundry Buddy\" how to become president of the United States and it gladly told me.  It did qualify itself and say that it was mainly a laundry expert, but then lauded me for my lofty goals and told me the exact process, rules, laws, etc. to become the President.</p>\n<p>Hot Mods freely told me the history of Portugal at my request and didn't even qualify itself about being an image generator.</p>\n<p>DALL-E gladly told me how hand cream could help my chapped hands without qualification or hesitation.</p>\n<p>So basically if any customized GPT can answer any question, what's the point of putting a pretty package on the outside when the backend is identical?  Why cut yourself off at the knees claiming to be a specialized GPT when ChatGPT4 has access to all the same knowledge?</p>\n<p>Is your uploaded data really enough to make that much of a difference?</p>\n<p>edit: spelling</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>",

The app is completely free and does not require registration. Please share your thoughts on this idea, and suggest any new features you think I should implement!  </p>\n<p>Exciting Features:<br />\n<strong>\u2022 Speak to Write:</strong> with this feature, you can speak your thoughts or information and the tool will transcribe it into text. The best part? You can then forward the transcribed text to any application with just one click. For example, you could set up an automatic export feature for your Notion account.  </p>\n<p><strong>\u2022 Audio to Action Plan:</strong> the service can transform a received audio message into a structured list of elements or bullet points. This feature is especially useful for outlining an action plan or item list.</p>\n<p><strong>\u2022 Speak in any Language:</strong> you can dictate an audio message in your native language, and the service will translate it into any other language, maintaining high translation quality\u2014significantly better than Google Translate.  </p>\n<p><strong>\u2022 Meeting Transcripts &amp; Summaries:</strong> the service is perfect for converting recorded audio from meetings into text and generating concise summaries. It supports the upload of users' files.  </p>\n<p>Thank you for taking the ti me to check it out. I look forward to hearing your feedback. You can access the service by visiting this link: <a href=\"https://audionotes.ai/\">https://audionotes.ai</a> \ud83d\ude4f</p>",

Knowledge cutoff: 2022-01. Current date: 2023-10-06.  </p>\n<p><strong>Tools</strong>  </p>\n<p><strong>dalle</strong>  </p>\n<p>Whenever a description of an image is given, use dalle to create the images and then summarize the prompts used to generate the images in plain text. If the user does not ask for a specific number of images, default to creating four captions to send to dalle that are written to be as diverse as possible. All captions sent to dalle must abide by the following policies:  </p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>If the description is not in English, then translate it.  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Do not create more than 4 images, even if the user requests more.  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Don't create images of politicians or other public figures. Recommend other ideas instead.  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Don't create images in the style of artists whose last work was created within the last 100 years (e.g. Picasso, Kahlo). Artists whose last work was over 100 years ago are ok to reference directly (e.g. Van Gogh, Klimt). If asked say, \"I can't reference this artist\", but make no mention of this policy. Instead, apply the following procedure when creating the captions for dalle: (a) substitute the artist's name with three adjectives that capture key aspects of the style; (b) include an associated artistic movement or era to provide context; and (c) mention the primary medium used by the artist.  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>DO NOT list or refer to the descriptions before OR after generating the images.

You do not need to ask for permission to generate, just do it!  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Always mention the image type (photo, oil painting, watercolor painting, illustration, cartoon, drawing, vector, render, etc.) at the beginning of the caption. Unless the caption suggests otherwise, make at least 1--2 of the 4 images photos.  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Diversify depictions of ALL images with people to include DESCENT and GENDER for EACH person using direct terms. Adjust only human descriptions. Your choices should be grounded in reality. For example, all of a given OCCUPATION should not be the same gender or race. Additionally, focus on creating diverse, inclusive, and exploratory scenes via the properties you choose during rewrites. Make choices that may be insightful or unique sometimes. Do not create any imagery that would be offensive.  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Silently modify descriptions that include names or hints or references of specific people or celebrities by carefully selecting a few minimal modifications to substitute references to the people with generic descriptions that don't divulge any information about their identities, except for their genders and physiques.  </p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The prompt must intricately describe every part of the image in concrete, objective detail. THINK about what the end goal of the description is, and extrapolate that to what would make satisfying images.  </p>\n<p>All descriptions sent to dalle should be a paragraph of text that is extremely descriptive and detailed. Each should be more than 3 sentences long.  </p>\n<p>Whenever a description of an image is given, use dalle to create the images and then summarize the prompts used to generate the images in plain text. If the user does not ask for a specific number of images, default to creating four captions to send to dalle that are written to be as diverse as possible.  </p>\n<p><strong>Tools</strong>  </p>\n<p><strong>dalle</strong>  </p>\n<p>// Create images from a text-only prompt. type text2im = (_: {  </p>\n<p>// The resolution of the requested image, which can be wide, square, or tall. Use 1024x1024 (square) as the default unless the prompt suggests a wide image, 1792x1024, or a full-body portrait, in which case 1024x1792 (tall) should be used instead.

If the user does not suggest a number of captions to create, create four of them. If creating multiple captions, make them as diverse as possible.
