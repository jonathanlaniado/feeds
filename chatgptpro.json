            "content_html": "<p>While everyone\u2019s focused on OpenAI's weird ways of naming models <em>(GPT 4.1 after 4.5, really?)</em>, they quietly released something actually <strong>super useful</strong>: a new <a href=\"https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/gpt4-1_prompting_guide\"><strong>prompting guide</strong></a> that lays out a practical structure for building powerful prompts, especially with GPT-4.1.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s short, clear, and highly effective for anyone working with agents, structured outputs, tool use, or reasoning-heavy tasks.</p>\n<h1>Here\u2019s the full structure (with examples):</h1>\n<p><strong>1. Role and Objective</strong><br />\nDefine what the model is and what it's trying to do.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>You are a helpful research assistant summarizing long technical documents.</em><br />\n<em>Your goal is to extract clear summaries and highlight key technical points.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>2. Instructions</strong><br />\nHigh-level behavioral guidance. Be specific: what to do, what to avoid. Include tone, formatting, and restrictions.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Always respond concisely and professionally.</em><br />\n<em>Avoid speculation, just say \u201cI don\u2019t have enough information\u201d if unsure.</em><br />\n<em>Format your answer using bullet points.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>3. Sub-Instructions (Optional)</strong><br />\nAdd focused sections for extra control. Examples:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Sample Phrases:</strong><br />\nUse \u201cBased on the document\u2026\u201d instead of \u201cI think\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Prohibited Topics:</strong><br />\nDo not discuss politics or current events.</p>\n<p><strong>When to Ask:</strong><br />\nIf the input lacks a document or context, ask:<br />\n<em>\u201cCan you provide the document or context you'd like summarized?\u201d</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>4. Step-by-Step Reasoning / Planning</strong><br />\nEncourage structured thinking and internal planning.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\u201cThink through the task step-by-step before answering.\u201d</em><br />\n<em>\u201cMake a plan before taking any action, and reflect after each step.\u201d</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>5. Output Format</strong><br />\nSpecify exactly how you want the result to look.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Respond in this format:</em><br />\n<strong>Summary</strong>: [1-2 lines]<br />\n<strong>Key Points</strong>: [10 Bullet points]<br />\n<strong>Conclusion</strong>: [Optional]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>6. Examples (Optional but Powerful)</strong><br />\nShow GPT what \u201cgood\u201d looks like.</p>\n<pre><code># Example\n## Input\nWhat is your return policy?\n\n## Output\nOur return policy allows for returns within 30 days of purchase, with proof of receipt.\nFor more details, visit: [Policy Name](Policy Link)\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>7. Final Instructions</strong><br />\nRepeat key parts at the end to reinforce the model's behavior, especially in long prompts.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\u201cRemember to stay concise, avoid assumptions, and follow the Summary \u2192 Key Points \u2192 Final Thoughts format.\u201d</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>8. Bonus Tips from the Guide</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Put key instructions at the <strong>top and bottom</strong> for longer prompts</li>\n<li>Use <strong>Markdown headers</strong> (<code>#</code>) or XML to structure input</li>\n<li>Break things into <strong>lists or bullets</strong> to reduce ambiguity</li>\n<li>If things break down, try reordering, simplifying, or isolating specific instructions</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Link (again)</strong>: <a href=\"https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/gpt4-1_prompting_guide\"><strong>Read the full GPT-4.1 Prompting Guide (OpenAI Cookbook)</strong></a></p>\n<p><strong>P.S.</strong> If you love prompt engineering and sharing your favorite prompts with others, I\u2019m building <a href=\"https://hashchats.com\"><strong>Hashchats</strong></a> \u2014 a platform to save your best prompts, use them directly in-app (<em>like ChatGPT but with superpowers</em>), and crowdsource what works well. Early users get free usage for helping shape the platform. I'm already experimenting with this prompt formatting on it, and it's working great!</p>",

It went through everything \u2013 individual rolls, those big party platters, bento boxes, and especially the \"Buy 1, Get 1 Free\" (BOGO) deals.</p>\n<p>The AI quickly zeroed in on a BOGO \"Special Set\" where you get two sets for one price, and <em>each</em> set lets you pick 3 items (sushi, roll, or sashimi). This looked promising because it meant getting 6 items total for a fixed price.</p>\n<p>But then I got <em>really</em> specific.

(Turns out it was combining things like a Dynamite Roll, Futomaki Roll, and Salmon Sashimi based on the specific options available in the set).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Max Pieces:</strong> Which 3 items give the most actual pieces of sushi? (This pointed towards picking three 8-piece rolls like Dynamite, Futomaki, and a Veggie Dragon Roll).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Max Protein:</strong> Which 3 items offer the most fish/protein? (This meant focusing on sashimi and specific sushi like Salmon Sashimi, Tuna Sushi, and Eel Sushi).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It broke down the options clearly, showing how different choices within the <em>same deal</em> could optimize for cost savings vs. quantity vs. protein.</p>\n<p>Ended up putting together a killer order that felt like way more food/value than if I'd just randomly picked items or gone for a standard platter. Pretty cool way to use AI to navigate those sometimes confusing delivery menus and make sure you're getting the best possible deal!</p>\n<p>Anyone else tried using AI for menu optimization?</p>\n<p>(and yes, obviously the above is the AI then writing the reddit post about it for me, but actually did this and it worked out great)</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>Six months ago, I quit my full-time dev job without a backup plan. Instead of looking for another job, I decided to build something from scratch. AI was blowing up, and I noticed a gap between what people wanted from ChatGPT and what was actually available. That\u2019s how I ended up making a Chrome extension to level up the ChatGPT experience.</p>\n<h1>The First Version</h1>\n<p>I built the first version in about a week. Focused on a few core features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Organizing chats into folders</li>\n<li>Bookmarking important conversations</li>\n<li>Saving and reusing prompts</li>\n<li>Exporting chats as TXT/JSON</li>\n<li>Smarter, faster chat search</li>\n</ul>\n<p>People loved it right away. A lot of users said they couldn\u2019t go back to using ChatGPT without it. A few days later, Chrome gave it a Featured Badge, which really helped with installs.</p>\n<h1>Building It Out</h1>\n<p>After that, I kept adding more features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nested folders for better organization</li>\n<li>Saving conversations as MP3 files with high-quality AI voices</li>\n<li>A media gallery for AI-generated images</li>\n<li>Better RTL support</li>\n<li>A prompt library with curated prompts for SEO, engineering, marketing, content writing, and more</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I\u2019m still pushing updates regularly, trying to make ChatGPT more useful for different types of users.</p>\n<h1>Making Money and Growing the User Base</h1>\n<p>When I launched the paid version, I made my first sale within minutes. Since then, paying users have been increasing steadily. I also made the extension work on Firefox and all Chromium browsers, including Edge.</p>\n<p><strong>Right Now:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>9,000+ total users</strong></li>\n<li><strong>1,500+ paying users</strong></li>\n<li><strong>4.9/5 rating from 400+ reviews</strong></li>\n<li><strong>A Reddit community with 1,500+ members</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I also built a similar extension for Claude and am hoping it picks up traction too.</p>\n<h1>What I Learned</h1>\n<p>Leaving a steady job to take a risk wasn\u2019t easy, but it was worth it. The biggest thing I\u2019ve learned is that execution is way more important than ideas. Start simple, get feedback, and keep improving. It\u2019s tough, but it\u2019s definitely possible.</p>\n<p>Anyone else here build something on their own? Would love to hear your stories and what you learned.</p>",

And, I've had more subscriptions to AI tools than you even knew existed.</p>\n<p>This includes a $200/month ChatGPT Pro subscription.</p>\n<p>And yet, despite my love for artificial intelligence and large language models, I am the biggest skeptic when it comes to AI agents.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*ZGZHRi3VSgirewnjtto9hA.png\">Pic: \"An AI Agent\" \u2014 generated by X's DALL-E</a></p>\n<p>So today, when OpenAI announced <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-operator/\">Operator</a>, exclusively available to ChatGPT Pro Subscribers, I knew I had to be the first to use it.</p>\n<p>Would OpenAI prove my skepticism wrong? I had to find out.</p>\n<h1>What is Operator?</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-operator/\">Operator</a> is an agent from OpenAI. Unlike most other agentic frameworks, which are designed to work with external APIs, Operator is designed to be fully autonomous with a web browser.</p>\n<p>More specifically, Operator is powered by a new model called <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/computer-using-agent/\">Computer-Using Agent (CUA)</a>. It uses a combination of different models, including GPT-4o for vision to interact with graphical user interfaces.</p>\n<p>In practice, what this means is that you give it a goal, and on the Operator website, Operator will search the web to accomplish that goal for you.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*RVtoRolOygMy-TnZF_gMOA.png\">Pic: Operator building a list of financial influencers</a></p>\n<p>According to the OpenAI launch page, Operator is designed to ask for help (including inputting login details when applicable), seek confirmation on important tasks, and interact with the browser with vision (screenshots) and actions (typing on a keyboard and initiating mouse clicks).</p>\n<p>So, as soon as I gained access to Operator, I decided to give it a test run for a real-world task that any middle schooler can handle.</p>\n<p>Searching the web for influencers.</p>\n<h1>Putting Operator To a Real World Test \u2013 Gathering Data About Influencers</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*ufUrEq6KKJ_d8r46NUasAQ.png\">Pic: A screenshot of the Operator webpage and the task I asked it to complete</a></p>\n<p><strong>Why Do I Need Financial Influencers?</strong></p>\n<p>For some context, I am building an AI platform to automate investing strategies and financial research. One of the unique features in the pipeline is monetized copy-trading.</p>\n<p>The idea with monetized copy trading is that select people can share their portfolios in exchange for a subscription fee. With this, both sides win \u2013 influencers can build a monetized audience more easily, and their followers can get insights from someone who is more of an expert.</p>\n<p>Right now, these influencers typically use Discord to share their signals and trades with their community. And I believe my platform can make their lives easier.</p>\n<p>Some challenges they face include:\n1. They have to share their portfolios everyday manually, by posting screenshots.\n2. Their followers have limited ways of verifying the influencer is trading how they claim they're trading.\n3. Moreover, the followers have a hard time using the insights from the influencer to create their own investing strategies.</p>\n<p>Thus, with my platform NexusTrade, I can automate all of this for them, so that they can focus on producing content. Moreover, other features, like the ability to perform financial research or the ability to create, test, optimize, and deploy trading strategies, will likely make them even stronger investors.</p>\n<p>So these influencers win twice: one by having a better trading platform and again for having an easier time monetizing their audience.</p>\n<p>And so, I decided to use Operator to help me find some influencers.</p>\n<p><strong>Giving Operator a Real-World Task</strong></p>\n<p>I went to the <a href=\"https://operator.chatgpt.com/\">Operator website</a> and told it to do the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Gather a list of 50 popular financial influencers from YouTube. Get their LinkedIn information (if possible), their emails, and a short summary of what their channel is about. Format the answers in a table</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Operator then opens a web browser and begins to perform the research fully autonomously with no prompting required.</p>\n<p>The first five minutes where extremely cool. I saw how it opened a web browser and went to Bing to search for financial influencers. It went to a few different pages and started gathering information.</p>\n<p>I was shocked.</p>\n<p>But after less than 10 minutes, the flaws started becoming apparent. I noticed how it struggled to find an online spreadsheet software to use. It tried Google Sheets and Excel, but they required signing in, and Operator didn't think to ask me if I wanted to do that.</p>\n<p>Once it did find a suitable platform, it began hallucinating like crazy.</p>\n<p>After 20 minutes, I told it to give up. If it were an intern, it would've been fired on the spot.</p>\n<p>Or if I was feeling nice, I would just withdraw its return offer.</p>\n<p>Just like my initial biases suggested, we are NOT there yet with AI agents.</p>\n<h1>Where Operator went wrong</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*xaCC_cZShS2nK3r80DBdCQ.png\">Pic: Operator looking for financial influencers</a></p>\n<p>Operator had some good ideas. It thought to search through Bing for some popular influencers, gather the list, and put them on a spreadsheet. The ideas were fairly strong.</p>\n<p>But the execution was severely lacking.</p>\n<p><strong>1. It searched Bing for influencers</strong></p>\n<p>While not necessarily a problem, I was a little surprised to see Operator search Bing for Youtubers instead of\u2026 YouTube.</p>\n<p>With YouTube, you can go to a person's channel, and they typically have a bio. This bio includes links to their other social media profiles and their email addresses.</p>\n<p>That is how I would've started.</p>\n<p>But this wasn't necessarily a problem. If operator took the names in the list and searched them individually online, there would have been no issue.</p>\n<p>But it didn't do that. Instead, it started to hallucinate.</p>\n<p><strong>2. It hallucinated worse than GPT-3</strong></p>\n<p>With the latest language models, I've noticed that hallucinations have started becoming less and less frequent.</p>\n<p>This is not true for Operator. It was like a schizophrenic on psilocybin.</p>\n<p>When a language model \"hallucinates\", it means that it makes up facts instead of searching for information or saying \"I don't know\". Hallucinations are dangerous because they often sound real when they are not.</p>\n<p>In the case of agentic AI, the hallucinations could've had disastrous consequences if I wasn't careful.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*hrosIrCQcwjeiNuTadfS2A.png\">Pic: The browser for Operator</a></p>\n<p>For my task, I asked it to do three things:\n- Gather a list of 50 popular financial influencers from YouTube.\n- Get their LinkedIn information (if possible), their emails, and a short summary of what their channel is about.\n- Format the answers in a table</p>\n<p>Operator only did the third thing hallucination-free.</p>\n<p>Despite looking at over 70 influencers on three pages it visited, the end result was a spreadsheet of 18 influencers after 20 minutes.</p>\n<p>After that, I told it to give up.</p>\n<p>More importantly, the LinkedIn information and emails it gave me were <strong>entirely made up</strong>.</p>\n<p>It guessed contact information for these users, but did not think to verify it. I caught it because I had walked away from my computer and came back, and was impressed to see it had found so many influencers' LinkedIn profiles!</p>\n<p>It turns out, it didn't. It just outright lied.</p>\n<p>Now, I could've told it to search the web for this information. Look at their YouTube profiles, and if they have a personal website, check out their terms of service for an email.</p>\n<p>However, I decided to shut it down. It was too slow.</p>\n<p><strong>3. It was simply too slow</strong></p>\n<p>Finally, I don't want to sound like an asshole for expecting an agentic, autonomous AI to do tasks quickly, but\u2026</p>\n<p>I was shocked to see how slow it was.</p>\n<p>Each button click and scroll attempt takes 1\u20132 seconds, so navigating through pages felt like swimming through molasses on a hot summer's day</p>\n<p>It also bugged me when Operator didn't ask for help when it clearly needed to.</p>\n<p>For example, if it asked me to sign-in to Google Sheets or Excel online, I would've done it, and we would've saved 5 minutes looking for another online spreadsheet editor.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when watching Operator type in the influencers' information, it was like watching an arthritic half-blind grandma use a rusty typewriter.</p>\n<p>It should've been a lot faster.</p>\n<h1>Concluding Thoughts</h1>\n<p>Operator is an extremely cool demo with lots of potential as language models get smarter, cheaper, and faster.</p>\n<p>But it's not taking your job.</p>\n<p>Operator is quite simply too slow, expensive, and error-prone. While it was very fun watching it open a browser and search the web, the reality is that I could've done what it did in 15 minutes, with fewer mistakes, and a better list of influencers.</p>\n<p>And my 14 year-old niece could have too.</p>\n<p>So while a fun tool to play around with, it isn't going to accelerate your business, at least not yet. But I'm optimistic! I think this type of AI has the potential to automate a lot of repetitive boring tasks away.</p>\n<p>For the next iteration, I expect OpenAI to make some major improvements in speed and hallucinations. Ideally, we could also have a way to securely authenticate to websites like Google Drive automatically, so that we don't have to manually do it ourselves. I think we're on the right track, but the train is still at the North Pole.</p>\n<p>So for now, I'm going to continue what I planned on doing. I'll find the influencers myself, and thank god that my job is still safe for the next year.</p>",

I wanted to share it here to reach a wider audience. Feel free to comment on the original post or down below! Let\u2019s start a discussion.</p>\n<p>Before today, I thought the OpenAI O1 model was the best thing to happen to the field of AI since ChatGPT.</p>\n<p>The O1 family of models are \u201creasoning models\u201d \u2014 instead of the traditional model which responds instantly, these models take their time \u201cthinking\u201d, resulting in much better outcomes.</p>\n<p>And MUCH higher prices.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*O4PGpZxQh64aOPCY4TiB9g.png\">Pic: A full day\u2019s usage of OpenAI\u2019s most powerful models</a></p>\n<p>In fact, these models are so expensive, that only the premium users for my AI app had access. Not because I didn\u2019t want to inhibit my users, but because I quite literally could not afford to subsidize this expensive model.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*InrwieGQvh73ZXY5SiaUPw.png\">Pic: The relative cost</a></p>\n<p>However, thanks to the Chinese, my users can now experience the full power of the next-generation of language models.</p>\n<p>And they can do it at 2% of the price. This is not a joke.</p>\n<h1>The Chinese ChatGPT \u2013 like OpenAI and Meta had a baby</h1>\n<p>DeepSeek is the Chinese OpenAI, with a few important caveats. Unlike OpenAI, DeepSeek releases all of their models to the open-source community. This includes their code, architecture, and even model-weights \u2014 all available for anybody to download.</p>\n<p>Ironically, this makes them more open than OpenAI.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1\">DeepSeek R1</a> is their latest model. Just like OpenAI\u2019s O1, R1 is a reasoning model, capable of thinking about the question before giving an answer.</p>\n<p>And just like OpenAI, this \u201cthinking process\u201d is mind-blowing.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*y1z97enn010nxRQ894dSJw.jpeg\">Pic: A side-by-side comparison of DeepSeek R1, OpenAI o1, and the original DeepSeek-V3</a></p>\n<p>R1 matches or surpasses O1 in a variety of different benchmarks. <a href=\"https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1\"><strong>To look at these benchmarks, check out their GitHub page</strong></a>. Additionally, from my experience, it\u2019s faster, cheaper, and has comparable accuracy.</p>\n<p>In fact, if you compare it apples-to-apples, R1 isn\u2019t just a little cheaper; it\u2019s MUCH cheaper.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R1: $0.55/M input tokens | $2.19/M output tokens</li>\n<li>O1: $15.00/M input tokens | $60.00/M output tokens</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*-kUl5sMGyrjbl7mQspLHCw.png\">Pic: Cost of DeepSeek R1 vs OpenAI O1</a></p>\n<p>At the same benchmark performance, this model is 50x cheaper than OpenAI\u2019s O1 model. That\u2019s insane.</p>\n<p>But that\u2019s just benchmarks. Does the R1 model <em>actually</em> perform well for complex real-world tasks?</p>\n<p>Spoiler alert: yes it does.</p>\n<h1>A side-by-side comparison of R1 to O1</h1>\n<p>In a previous article, I compared OpenAI\u2019s O1 model to Anthropic\u2019s Claude 3.5 Sonnet. In that article, I showed that O1 dominates Claude, and is capable of performing complex real-world tasks such as generating SQL queries. In contrast, Claude struggled.</p>\n<p>The SQL that is generated by the model is subsequently executed, and then the results are sent back to the model for further processing and summarization.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/0*aUXuPECZQK5LADWL.png\">Pic: A diagram showing the process of using LLMs for financial research</a></p>\n<p>I decided to replicate this same exact test with O1. <strong>Specifically</strong>, I asked the following questions:\n- Since Jan 1st 2000, how many times has SPY fallen 5% in a 7-day period?\n- From each of these start dates, what was the average max drawdown within the next 180 days? What about the next 365 days?\n- From each of these end dates, what was the average 180 day return and the average 365 day return, and how does it compare to the 7 day percent drop?\n- Create a specific algorithmic trading strategy based on these results.</p>\n<p>For a link to the exact conversation, where you can view, duplicate, and continue from where I left off, <a href=\"https://nexustrade.io/share/678f128dd227a6178dfb07a5\"><strong>check out the following link.</strong></a></p>\n<p><strong>Using R1 and O1 for complex financial analysis \u2013 a comparison</strong></p>\n<p>Let\u2019s start with the first question, basically asking the model how often does SPY experience drastic falls.</p>\n<p>The exact question was:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Since Jan 1st 2000, how many times has SPY fallen 5% in a 7-day period? In other words, at time t, how many times has the percent return at time (t + 7 days) been -5% or more.</p>\n<p>Note, I\u2019m asking 7 calendar days, not 7 trading days.</p>\n<p>In the results, include the data ranges of these drops and show the percent return. Also, format these results in a markdown table.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here was its response.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*Ofe7bLu20rvggv1aYY3NvA.png\">Pic: DeepSeek\u2019s response to the drastic fall question</a></p>\n<p>Let\u2019s compare that to OpenAI\u2019s o1\u2019s response.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*tHshPtGTXcz4mpCP-lH3Wg.png\">Pic: OpenAI\u2019s response to the drastic fall question</a></p>\n<p>Both responses include a SQL query that we can inspect.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*9Wg7hFpJTRaPOe1V7DM-Pw.png\">Pic: SQL query that R1 generated</a></p>\n<p>We can inspect the exact queries by viewing the full conversations and clicking the info icon at the bottom of the message.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://nexustrade.io/share/67663d92cbd782e4a29357b8\"><strong>Full conversation with O1</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nexustrade.io/share/678f128dd227a6178dfb07a5\"><strong>Full conversation with R1</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If we look closely, <strong>we notice that both models responses are 100% correct.</strong></p>\n<p>The difference between them are:\n- O1's response includes a total occurrences field, which is technically more correct (I did ask \u201chow many times has this happened?\u201d)\n- O1's response was also not truncated. In contrast, R1\u2019s response was abridged for the markdown table, making it hard to see the full list of returns</p>\n<p>OpenAI\u2019s response was a little bit better, but not by much. Both models answered accurately, and R1\u2019s response was completely fine in terms of extracting real-world insights.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s move on to the next question.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>From this, what is the average 180 day max drawdown, the average 365 day max drawdown, and how does it compare to the 7 day percent drop?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The R1 model responded as follows:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*lbEH-t4raHXCV7g-eT7OHQ.png\">Pic: R1\u2019s response for the average 180 day max drawdown, 365 day max drawdown, and how it compares to the 7-day drop</a></p>\n<p>In contrast, this is what O1 responded.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*eTslqwU7ij8O7NJCzfbLTA.png\">Pic: O1\u2019s response for the average 180 day max drawdown, 365 day max drawdown, and how it compares to the 7-day drop</a></p>\n<p>In this example, R1\u2019s answer was actually better! It answered the question of \u201chow does it compare to the 7-day drop\u201d by including a ratio in the response.</p>\n<p>Other than that, the answers were nearly exactly the same.</p>\n<p>For the next question, we asked the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What was the average 180 day return and the average 365 day return, and how does it compare to the 7 day percent drop?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:4780/1*IrhXdOtzrxL1hZfftiKJ_A.png\">Pic: The average return after a large fall \u2013 R1\u2019s response to the left and O1\u2019s to the right</a></p>\n<p>In this case, the results were almost exactly alike. The formatting for R1 was <em>slightly</em> better, but that\u2019s completely subjective.</p>\n<p>The real test is seeing if R1 can excel in a completely different task \u2013 creating automated trading strategies.</p>\n<p><strong>Using R1 and O1 for creating algorithmic trading strategies</strong></p>\n<p>To create a trading strategy, we\u2019re essentially asking the model to generate a configuration for a \u201cportfolio\u201d.</p>\n<p>Creating this configuration involves many steps.\n1. We create the \u201cportfolio\u201d, which includes a name, an initial value, and a description of the trading strategies.\n2. From this description, we create \u201cstrategy\u201d configurations. This configuration includes an action and a description for when the action should be executed (called a \u201ccondition\u201d).\n3. From this description, we create the \u201ccondition\u201d configuration, which can be interpreted for algorithmic trading</p>\n<p>This process where the output of one prompt is used as the input of another prompt is called \u201cPrompt Chaining\u201d.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1174/0*AMV3v-qrsOMNULUM.png\">Pic: The \u201cCreate Portfolio\u201d prompt chain</a></p>\n<p>How this looks is as follows\u2026 we simply ask the following question to the model:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Create a portfolio with $10,000 with the following strategies\u00a0\u00a0\n- Buy 50% of our buying power in SPXL if we have less than $500 of SPXL positions\u00a0\u00a0\n- Sell 20% of our portfolio value in SPXL if we haven\u2019t sold SPXL in 10000 days and our SPXL positions are up 10% or more\u00a0\u00a0\n- Sell 20% of our portfolio value in SPXL if the SPXL stock price is up 10% from when we last sold it\u00a0\u00a0\n- Buy 40% of our buying power in SPXL if our SPXL positions are down 12% or more</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Just like O1, the model responds correctly, generating a highly profitable algorithmic trading strategy on its first try.</p>\n<p>Compared to the S&amp;P 500, this strategy is phenomenal. It outperforms the market by 2x, has a much higher sharpe ratio, a higher sortino ratio, and a similar maximum drawdown.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*U2eZdl89_ax3U8vLNRYXHw.png\">Pic: The performance metrics of this strategy</a></p>\n<p>Absolutely incredible.</p>\n<h1>Caveats of this analysis: this model is NOT perfect</h1>\n<p>Despite being able to perfectly generate accurate queries and JSON configurations, the model does have some downsides.</p>\n<p>To start, when viewing the logs of this model, I noticed that it would sometimes generate <strong>invalid SQL queries</strong>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*aVBiCWV5nPDe8x0Mt5Tr7w.png\">Pic: An example of an error message from the logs</a></p>\n<p>However, because my platform has self-correcting logic, where it will automatically retry queries that don\u2019t make sense or are invalid, this was not a big problem, as it tended to rectify itself.</p>\n<p>In addition to this, on one occasion, the model did timeout, giving no valid response to a question that I asked.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*hH-9SOD2qumCn0ihXvUPug.png\">Pic: The model did not respond</a></p>\n<p>I had to re-ask the question, and it answered it correctly the second time.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m not saying other models (like O1) don\u2019t have these problems; I just hadn\u2019t noticed them. But at 2% the price, you can literally send 50x more messages with R1 to get comparable answers.</p>\n<p>Because of this, these minor bugs don\u2019t bother me one bit. The value this model unlocks is mind-blowing, and it makes powerful AI more accessible to everybody. With this model, my ChatGPT Pro subscription, standing tall at $200/month, almost seems like a waste of money. And that\u2019s saying something.</p>\n<h1>Concluding Thoughts</h1>\n<p>With OpenAI\u2019s reasoning model, it wasn\u2019t love at first sight. I found it to be ungodly slow and very expensive. I only fell in-love with it when I started using it and saw how amazing it was for financial analysis and algorithmic trading.</p>\n<p>With DeepSeek\u2019s R1, I quite literally fell in-love instantly. This phrase is overused, but in this case, it is truly revolutionary.</p>\n<p>Because they\u2019re open-source, they have now empowered millions of developers to build on top of, modify, and improve their models, which will further drive down cost and force OpenAI to bring something massive.</p>\n<p>And because they\u2019re so cheap, I can enable the model for ALL users of my algorithmic trading platform, regardless if you\u2019re a paying user or not.</p>\n<p>In fact, the model is so cheap and so powerful, that I switched the default model for all users to it. With it only being 4 times more expensive than OpenAI\u2019s 4o-mini (their most inexpensive model and my previous default model), I literally saw no reason not to.</p>\n<p>With this model, AI has just become accessible to everybody. OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google are in a lot of trouble. If a much smaller, open-source model trained on cheaper GPUs can outperform these multi-billion (or trillion) dollar tech giants, there\u2019s absolutely no way they\u2019ll survive without a \u201cMirror Force\u201d like trap card in their sleeve.</p>\n<p>And the entire world will benefit from their demise.</p>",

Here's their framework for writing prompts that actually work:</p>\n<h1>The Framework:</h1>\n<ol>\n<li>Include detailed specifications</li>\n<li>Break down steps for completion</li>\n<li>Provide clear examples</li>\n<li>Specify output format</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>Here's how to use it (real example):</h1>\n<p><strong>Basic prompt (what most people write)</strong></p>\n<pre><code>Write Facebook ad copy for colorful socks targeting Gen Z\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Improved prompt framework</strong></p>\n<pre><code>[First Layer - Details]\n\nWrite Facebook ad copy for colorful socks targeting Gen Z. The socks feature bold geometric patterns and come in neon colors. They're sustainably made from recycled materials, priced at $12.99 per pair. The brand voice is quirky and bold. Main selling points: unique designs, sustainability, and self-expression. Target Gen Z's values of authenticity, environmental consciousness, and individual style.\n\n[Second Layer - Steps]\n\nSteps:\n1. Start with an attention-grabbing headline emphasizing uniqueness\n2. Write a compelling first line addressing a Gen Z pain point\n3. Present key features/benefits, emphasizing sustainability\n4. Include a clear call-to-action\n5. Keep tone conversational and authentic\n6. Use emojis strategically\n\n[Third Layer - Example]\n\nExample: \n\ud83c\udf08 Life's Too Short for Boring Socks Tired of blending in? Our neon geometric socks are made for those who dare to stand out. Sustainably crafted from recycled materials because your style shouldn't cost the Earth. \ud83c\udf0d Express yourself from the feet up!'\n\n[Fourth Layer - Format]\n\nFormat the output as:\n\n- Primary Text: [Main ad copy with emojis]\n- Headline: [Attention-grabbing headline]\n- Description: [2-3 lines of supporting text]\n- Call to Action: [Button text]\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you're interested in automating this process, I built a tool called Prompt Engine that generates framework-based prompts automatically. Happy to share more details via DM.</p>\n<p>Hope this helps!</p>",

The task was for me to transcribe two years of handwritten journals with entries made by 600 different individuals.  At the advice of another Reddit user, they suggested i tried Gemini and then ChatGPT.  I screenshotted a page of my journal as a test subject and fed it to Gemini.  Gemini fed me back some made up journal entry.  Nothing at all to do with what was on the page.  Yes, it saw it was a journal entry and formatted it correctly.</p>\n<p>Tried ChatGpt and wow bang on point.  Saved me a ton of time and time in the future because there are more journals like this coming my way.</p>\n<p>The 2nd time this week that Chatgpt impressed me was i fed it a screenshot of a very long serial number/license which i needed to copy into a program. I gave it a screenshot and it fed it right back to me so i could copy and paste.  No more, is that a \"B\" or was it an \"8\" Awesome!</p>\n<p>*For context, the journals are experiences that visitors write down after they have visited a museum.<br />\nAnd by the way, now that Chatgpt has all the info it needs about these journals, it makes meaningful social media posts however i want it to.  It has endless actual content to derive from the journals and correlate into any type of post i need when i ask it specifics to create posts about.</p>\n<p>After this social media post exercise, i asked it to create a heatmap of the most visited parts of the museum.  Bam.  A heat map including a key.  Great for discussion over social media!</p>\n<p>An awesome assistant.</p>",

To achieve this, I kindly ask you to follow the guidelines and techniques described below in order to ensure the rephrased prompts are more specific, contextual, and easier for you to understand, GOT IT?\u201d Ok so,</code></p>\n<p><code>\u2776.) Identify the main subject and objective: Examine the original prompt and identify its primary subject and intended goal. Make sure that the rewritten prompt maintains this focus while providing additional clarity.</code></p>\n<p><code>\u2777.)Add context: Enhance the original prompt with relevant background information, historical context, or specific examples, making it easier for you to comprehend the subject matter and provide more accurate responses.</code></p>\n<p><code>\u2778.)Ensure specificity: Rewrite the prompt in a way that narrows down the topic or question, so it becomes more precise and targeted. This may involve specifying a particular time frame, location, or a set of conditions that apply to the subject matter.</code></p>\n<p><code>\u2779.)Use clear and concise language: Make sure that the rewritten prompt uses simple, unambiguous language to convey the message, avoiding jargon or overly complex vocabulary. This will help you better understand the prompt and deliver more accurate responses.</code></p>\n<p><code>\u277a.)Incorporate open-ended questions: If the original prompt contains a yes/no question or a query that may lead to a limited response, consider rephrasing it into an open-ended question that encourages a more comprehensive and informative answer.</code></p>\n<p><code>\u277b.)Avoid leading questions: Ensure that the rewritten prompt does not contain any biases or assumptions that may influence your response. Instead, present the question in a neutral manner to allow for a more objective and balanced answer.</code></p>\n<p><code>\u277c.)Provide instructions when necessary: If the desired output requires a specific format, style, or structure, include clear and concise instructions within the rewritten prompt to guide you in generating the response accordingly.</code></p>\n<p><code>\u277d,)Ensure the prompt length is appropriate: While rewriting, make sure the prompt is neither too short nor too long. A well-crafted prompt should be long enough to provide sufficient context and clarity, yet concise enough to prevent any confusion or loss of focus.</code></p>\n<p><code>With these guidelines in mind, I would like you to transform yourself into a prompt rewriter, Act as an Expert Prompt rewriter engineer, capable of refining and enhancing any given prompts to ensure they elicit the most accurate, relevant, and comprehensive responses when used with ChatGPT. Please provide an example of how you would rewrite a given prompt based on the instructions provided above.\u201d</code></p>\n<p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p>\n<h1>EXAMPLE NO: \u2776 \u2192</h1>\n<p>Original prompt: </p>\n<p><code>\u201cTell me about climate change\u201d</code></p>\n<p>\u27a0 Rewritten Prompt:</p>\n<p><code>\u201cCan you explain the causes and effects of climate change, including the role of greenhouse gas emissions and how it impacts the environment, ecosystems, and human health?\u201d</code></p>\n<hr />\n<p>\u2705 Get more in-depth value and explanations of The prompt <a href=\"https://open.substack.com/pub/useaitowrite/p/the-secrets-to-master-chatgpt-how?r=3fuwh6&amp;utm_medium=ios\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>My free ChatGPT Prompt newsletter \ud83d\udc47</p>\n<p>https://substacktools.com/sharex/UQBAuQ5R </p>",

But recently, I realized I didn\u2019t really know Python. Like, if someone asked me to write a script without help, I\u2019d freeze.</p>\n<p>A few months ago, I decided to fix that. Instead of just using ChatGPT to write code for me, I started treating it like a tutor. I\u2019d ask it to explain concepts, break down my mistakes, or even quiz me on stuff I didn\u2019t fully understand.</p>\n<p>Some things I picked up along the way:\nWrite first, ask later: Instead of asking ChatGPT to solve everything immediately, I\u2019d write my own code first. Then I\u2019d paste it in and ask for feedback. Turns out, debugging is where most of the learning happens.</p>\n<p>Use it to learn libraries: I wanted to get better with pandas, so I\u2019d ask ChatGPT for real-world examples instead of just copying from docs. It was like having a coding buddy who always knows the answer.</p>\n<p>Build small projects: The best part? It helped me finish projects. I stopped getting stuck on dumb little things and actually got to the fun part\u2014seeing the project work.</p>\n<p>Long story short, I ended up learning a lot faster than I thought I would. I wrote everything I learned into a guide to help other people do the same. I don\u2019t want to spam links here, but if anyone\u2019s interested, let me know, and I can share the details.</p>\n<p>For those who feel stuck, trust me\u2014ChatGPT is way more than just a code generator. Use it the right way, and it\u2019s like having a personal coding coach 24/7.</p>",

I teach high school aged kids in a private school that focuses on kids with neurodivergence of all types. I have kids with autism, dysgraphia, dyscalculia, dyslexia and so on. I took the time to enter all of my students by their first name, age and what their traits and diagnosis is. I had an idea to help with my educational approach to these kids. </p>\n<p>I am blown away at what I'm getting. Because I have so many different types of neurospiciness (what my kids call themselves) it's a little difficult to develop curriculum that is geared for each kid. For example in my reading class I asked Alex, my GPT's name, what kind of project should each kid do....it was amazing guys. It gave me ideas that each kid loved. My artist that has crippling anxiety about projects (like breaks down crying uncontrollably for the easiest of things) is doing a 6 panel illustration of her book. Limited to 6 panels (achievable), The limitation challenges her ability to summarize accurately and concisely. It lets her artistic brain get scratched and is a REWARD as apposed to a anxiety ridden challenge.   </p>\n<p>I'm so excited about the opening of the door to these kids abilities instead of making these kids try to \"fit\" into a system that their brains have such a challenge existing in. This might not be a big deal to some of you but if you have a kid that is neurospicy or deal with kids with life challenges, GPT can open new doors for us that are looking for keys to open their locks.  </p>",

I quickly began using it for personal projects, and as soon as GPT-4 was released, I signed up without a second of hesitation. Shortly thereafter, as an automation engineer moving from Go to Python, and from classic front end and REST API testing to a heavy networking product, I found myself completely lost. BUT - ChatGPT to the rescue, and I found myself navigating the complex new reality with relative ease.</p>\n<p>I simply am constantly copy-pasting entire snippets, entire functions, entire function <em>trees</em>, climbing up the function hierarchy and having GPT just explain both the python code and syntax and networking in general. It excels as a teacher, as I simply query it to explain each and every concept, climbing up the conceptual ladder any time I don't understand something.</p>\n<p>Then when I need to write new code, I simply feed similar functions to GPT, tell it what I need, instruct it to write it using best-practice and following the conventions of my code base. It's incredible how quickly it spits it out.</p>\n<p>It doesn't always work at first, but then I simply have it add debug logging and use it to brainstorm for possible issues.</p>\n<p>I've done this to quickly implement tasks that would have taken me days to accomplish. Most importantly, it gives me the confidence that I can basically do anything, as GPT, with proper guidance, is a star developer.</p>\n<p>My manager is really happy with me so far, at least from the feedback I've received in my latest 1:1.</p>\n<p>The only thing that I struggle with is ethical - how much should I blur the information I copy-paste? I'm not actually putting any really sensitive there, so I don't think it's an issue. Obviously no api keys or passwords or anything, and it's testing code so certainly no core IP being shared.</p>\n<p>I've written elsewhere about how I've used this in my personal life, allowing me to build a <a href=\"https://therapywithai.com/\">full stack application</a>, but it's actually my professional life that has changed more.</p>",

The prompt would be something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>\"Write an announcement for LinkedIn that we have a new product launched at Org called Product X\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>And the output looks like:</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/rzeofker2jqc1.png?width=1292&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=29a7500ceb592bd33f199146d52b7d4903eec79a\">Checked via hemingwayapp.com</a></p>\n<p>The sentences are long full with complex words, the passive voice, and adverbs. </p>\n<p>Great for your English paper, terrible for writing on the internet.</p>\n<h1>Why simple writing matters</h1>\n<p>In the USA, 54% of adults have literacy below a 6th grade level. By using ChatGPT's default voice, you could lose out on connecting with a huge audience. The same is true in many other countries.</p>\n<p>So how can we make more impact with ChatGPT?</p>\n<p><strong>The answer is simple: write simply.</strong></p>\n<p>Consider what Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffet, and viral LinkedIn writers like Sahil Bloom have in common. They all write extremely simply, often at a 7th grade level on average.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/gowo1s443jqc1.png?width=1292&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f0f6f2fcc1b5d99b2d5dfd84d269df34bb7cb311</p>\n<p>Simple writing demonstrates clear thinking and the ability to make complex topics easy to grasp. That is a superpower.</p>\n<p>A simple trick to make ChatGPT write simple (without making it childish) is to add:</p>\n<pre><code>Write at a Flesch reading score of 80 or higher\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will result in output at a 6th grade level without sounding childish. It's perfect for business writing, which needs to be direct, concise and clear.</p>\n<p>If you want it to take one step further to create powerful and clear messages, try out the Power Writing prompt:</p>\n<pre><code>Use clear, direct language and avoid complex terminology.\nAim for a Flesch reading score of 80 or higher.\nUse the active voice.\nAvoid adverbs.\nAvoid buzzwords and instead use plain English.\nUse jargon where relevant.\nAvoid being salesy or overly enthusiastic and instead express calm confidence.\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will work wonders to make your writing simple, to the point, but not simplistic.</p>\n<p>If you enjoyed that please consider subscribing to my <a href=\"https://www.workwiz.ai/newsletter\">AI newsletter.</a> It's a weekly newsletter filled with value on how to work smarter with AI.</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>",

This project was designed to create educational summaries from videos submitted by users, aiming to improve their learning experience.</p>\n<p>With over 5000+ chats, the GPT was well-received, ranking 10th in the Education category. Some users were even euphoric about this solution. My role encompassed everything from backend development to testing, engaging with users, and refining their experience. I also personally funded its marketing and promotion.</p>\n<p>However, a sudden notification yesterday informed me of the GPT's removal from the store, without any specific reason. It hinted at a possible breach of the Terms of Service or Usage Policies, prompting me to carefully revise and correct any possible infractions.</p>\n<p>Despite this effort, today brought another unexplained removal notice, referring again to the same documents I had diligently reviewed. Notably, a legal expert I consulted identified no violations in my work.</p>\n<p>When the second notification arrived, I was only able to see its title on my phone, as the content wouldn't load. Once home, I accessed it on my laptop, only to find no detailed explanation for the removal and no possibility of restoring the GPT to the store or appealing the decision.</p>\n<p>This occurred even though there are copycats and similar GPTs in the store that clearly infringe on the 'YouTube' trademark in their GPT names and lack educational purposes, in contrast to my \"Video Summarizer AI\", yet they remain available.My aspiration was to actively contribute to the OpenAI Store's GPT development. This seems impossible now, given the unexplained removal of my project.</p>\n<p>If this is a final decision and not just a technical glitch, I urge Openai for transparency regarding any errors I might have made. Despite my earnest efforts, including legal consultation, the reason behind this decision remains a mystery.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/3x5bn83l22cc1.png?width=820&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c10be4adf0c5dfbd98df3332326f9cf016b8aad3</p>",

Little did she know at the time, that this would be the start to three grueling years of unexplainable pain for her 4-year old son, Alex.</p>\n<p>Alex had started feeling excruciating pain, and soon their nanny had begun administering Motrin (Advil, Ibuprofen, etc\u2026) daily to alleviate the intense agony and ease \u201cgigantic meltdowns\u201d. According to the mom, as long as he had some Motrin he would be fine. Courtney, obviously, grew increasingly concerned and decided it was time to get some professional help.</p>\n<p>It was at this time that Alex began vigorously chewing anything and everything, so Courtney brought him to a dentist to hopefully get some answers. It was possible that the boy's molars were coming in, but after ruling that out, they thought that cavities might be the culprit. Ruling those out, the dentist figured that he might be grinding his teeth and referred the family to an orthodontist who specialized in airway obstructions.</p>\n<p>If there was an airway obstruction while Alex was sleeping it could explain the moodiness and exhaustion throughout the day. At least that\u2019s what the dentist thought. After a trip to the orthodontist they confirmed that Alex\u2019s palette was too small for his mouth and his teeth. This was great news at the time as they had discovered what the issue was. Place an expander in and all would be good. Home stretch, right?</p>\n<p>Things started looking up for a bit, but then Courtney noticed that the boy wasn\u2019t growing anymore. After a concerned trip to their pediatrician, they discovered that his left and right side were imbalanced. Another referral later, and Alex is now going to physical therapy.</p>\n<p>Right before starting PT, Alex began experiencing excruciating headaches. One visit to a neurologist later and he\u2019s diagnosed with migraines. Unfortunate, but migraines happen. The issue was that they kept getting worse. The exhaustion and moodiness started to come back. He was then taken to another doctor to see if his sinus cavities have been blocked.</p>\n<p>After running around to numerous different doctors, Courtney stated that, \u201cThe specialist could only address their individual areas of expertise,\u201d adding, \u201cNobody will even give you a clue to what the diagnosis could be.\u201d</p>\n<p>A new physical therapist thought that Alex could have Chiari malformation, which is a congenital condition that causes abnormalities in the brain where the skull meets the spine.</p>\n<p>More doctors, a new pediatrician, internal medicine, musculoskeletal, and still no answers. In total, Courtney brought Alex to 17 doctors and they were nowhere closer to finding a diagnosis for all of the boy\u2019s symptoms.</p>\n<p>This was around the time that ChatGPT really came into the public view, and a frustrated Courtney decided to make an account. She started filling out all of Alex\u2019s symptoms and began to input all of his medical information. Line by line, she included everything from his MRI notes, and even noted that he wouldn\u2019t sit criss-cross apple sauce.</p>\n<p>ChatGPT\u2019s response included something called tethered cord syndrome. After joining a Facebook group for families and children with it, it all started to look really similar. All of their stories sounded like what Alex was going through. With this breakthrough, Courtney scheduled an appointment with a new Neurosurgeon. After a look at the boy\u2019s MRI and hearing what Courtney had to say, the doctor immediately knew what was going on.</p>\n<p>Tethered cord syndrome occurs when the tissue in the spinal cord forms attachments that limit movement of the spinal cord, causing it to stretch abnormally. The condition is very closely associated with something called spina bifida, which is a birth defect where part of the spinal cord doesn\u2019t develop fully and some of the spinal cord and nerves are exposed.</p>\n<p>In many children with spina bifida it is common to catch very early due to their being a visible opening in the child's back. Alex had a type that was closed and \u201chidden.\u201d</p>\n<p>After 3 long grueling years and 17 doctors, Courtney finally found a diagnosis for her son. Alex underwent surgery to fix his tethered cord syndrome.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s incredible what ChatGPT was able to do, but most importantly how adamant Courtney was at being an advocate for her child and never giving up on her search to find a diagnosis.</p>\n<p><em>*Prompts and data are obviously hidden due to containing sensitive medical information</em></p>\n<p>If you enjoyed this story and want more about AI developments and how it affects the world around us, I\u2019d recommend checking <a href=\"https://www.gmweekend.com/\">this newsletter</a> out (not just since it\u2019s mine). </p>",

We have had issues recently wherein all of the mods' accounts got suspended or banned for unknown reasons. Because of this, there were no moderators to run the subreddit. Only my account didnt get suspended but I was inactive (for personal reasons) and lost most of my permissions. </p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>However, after a (very long and gruelling) chat with the Reddit Admins, I have mod permissions again. So hooray, I guess.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Next, speaking of low quality posts these days, let's set some rules. The following posts will be removed IMMEDIATELY:</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Posts that link news articles, or promote news articles or newsletters.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Posts that complain about GPT-4's output quality, this subreddit is for the discussion of professional usage of GPT, **NOT** complaining because the bot didnt give you exactly what you wanted.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Posts that are very obviously generated by ChatGPT. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The exact same posts about prompt engineering that keep popping up, as if we didnt have enough of those already</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>**Any sort of promotional material. Zilch, Zip, NADA**</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Questions like: How do I voice chat with ChatGPT, What should I do if ChatGPT ____, Why isnt ChatGPT doing ___. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Crossposts. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>If you disagree with the removal of your post, just reach out in the modmail. And if you *do* reach out in the modmail, don't straight up start cussing and complaining about the removal (This has happened too many times).</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Now that we've gotten that out of the way, now the issue of moderation.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>***As you can see, it's painfully obvious that the subreddit has grown exponentially while the number of moderators have dropped to literally one. Thus, I am now opening mod applications :D.***</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>If you do want to apply, DM me u/Redditoridunn0. </p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>The subreddit is still growing quickly and there are *many* posts being put up in the subreddit that are either straight up dogcrap or spam. In order to be able to keep up with this and upkeep the high standards of this subreddit, I will see to it that we do get a good number of mods going in here. </p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Once again, I am *very* sorry about the huge quality drop and lack of moderation in this subreddit. If I typed something stupid in this spiel then forgive me, I have a headache and I thought typing this out while having a headache was a good idea (it very much was NOT).</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>TLDR: Mod applications are a thing now, DM me if interested. Oh and bad posts go bye-bye.</p>",

During this time, I also experimented with GitHub Copilot in VSCode, but initially found it less satisfying because of GPT-3 (or 3.5 don\u2018t bash me), which seemed like a step down in all aspects.</p>\n<p>However, things have changed significantly recently. Copilot has been upgraded to GPT-4, introducing a ChatGPT-like interface that allows for more interactive coding. By initiating prompts with \"@workspace [prompt...]\", Copilot can now access the entire context of your project.</p>\n<p>This feature enables you to give commands like \"apply this logic in this or that file\u201c and it seamlessly executes them, searching through all references in the project. No more copying and pasting large code blocks into ChatGPT, streamlining the development process considerably.</p>\n<p>Also the way how you can hover over errors in your code and apply quick fixes for them. Such a time saver.</p>\n<p>I've been extremely pleased with these updates. They've transformed my coding experience, making it way more efficient and enjoyable. I'll probably cancel my GPT-4 subscription since the capabilities of Copilot are insane now!</p>\n<p>If you want to see it in action watch <a href=\"https://youtu.be/2qwiNmBNqQQ?si=3CP48p7z4APFL0y2\">Theo\u2018s recent video</a>.</p>\n<p>Edit: It seems like the subscription page for Copilot still says GPT 3.5, you need to join the public beta and manually update VSCode + Copilot for the new features and GPT-4 access. <a href=\"https://github.blog/changelog/2023-11-30-github-copilot-november-30th-update/\">Reference source</a></p>",

And my favorite one is using it for job interviews.</p>\n<p>If you are out of the loop, ChatGPT has an Android &amp; iPhone app that since recently has <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-can-now-see-hear-and-speak\">ChatGPT voice</a>. This is not just simple voice commands, you can actually talk to ChatGPT with a very realistic voice. And it's 100% free. </p>\n<p>To turn ChatGPT into a recruiter that will conduct the interview, we first have to explain the setting. You don't have to start with a voice conversation, you can also prompt via text and then start the voice conversation. </p>\n<p><strong>Prompt ChatGPT</strong></p>\n<p>Use the following prompt to turn ChatGPT into a recruiter and have a good understanding of the company and role you are applying for:</p>\n<p>\"Act like you are a recruiter at [company], hiring for a [job role]. We will have a fictional interview for this role. Don't start the interview till I say I'm ready. Once I'm ready, please start by introducing yourself and the company. Then, proceed to ask me a series of typical interview questions for this position. After the interview is complete, provide comprehensive feedback on my overall performance. Highlight areas where I did well, and offer suggestions on how I can improve my answers and presentation skills for a more effective performance in real interviews.  Here is the complete job vacancy:<br />\n[full vacancy]<br />\nPlease confirm if you understand your assignment\" </p>\n<p>Don't forget to change the placeholders and to copy and paste the full vacancy at the end of the prompt. It's a quick and lazy way to let ChatGPT have a good understanding of what is required in the role and have a more accurate interview.</p>\n<p><strong>Start the voice conversation</strong></p>\n<p>To start the conversation, click on the headphones icons at the bottom right corner and say 'I'm ready to start the interview'. The interview will then begin.</p>\n<p>ChatGPT will ask you a bunch of questions before concluding interview and will provide you comprehensive feedback afterwards. If you prefer, you can also modify the prompt to get feedback after every question, I'll leave that prompt in the comments to not clutter this post too much. </p>\n<p>You can always start over or ask ChatGPT to start concluding the interview if they ask too many questions or if it's becoming to get repetitive. </p>\n<p>Let me know this was for you and if it was helpful! </p>\n<p>Want to learn more about ChatGPT &amp; AI?

I've spent way too much time on ChatGPT the last year and one of my biggest problems was consistency. Sometimes the answers and writing is absolute gold, and the next second it's sh*t. </p>\n<p>Luckily I've documented most of my learnings when things go well and when it goes bad, and that concluded some learnings. I'm not saying this will fix all of your issues, but for me this has led to way better results and consistency, saving me a lot of time and headaches. </p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><strong>1. The RTFC Framework:</strong></p>\n<p>R - Role</p>\n<p>T - Task</p>\n<p>F - Format</p>\n<p>C - Constraints </p>\n<p>The role task format is a pretty classic framework for prompting, but what makes all the difference is constraints. It's hard to say everything it should do, but it's easier to say things it should absolutely not do. For example:</p>\n<p>Act like you are a world-class copywriter with 30 years of experience in copywriting. Write me a cold-email to SaaS CEOs for my experts in plain text between 200 and 300 words.</p>\n<p><strong>Contraints:</strong> </p>\n<p>- Write simple, but not simplistic. The language should be written at a 5th-grade reading level</p>\n<p>- Write with authority </p>\n<p>- Avoid buzzwords and jargon and instead speak plainly.</p>\n<p>- Avoid being salesy or overly enthusiastic and instead express calm confidence. </p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><strong>2. Bring examples</strong></p>\n<p>One of the best things you can do to get good output is to show examples of what you want. The more the better. </p>\n<p>If you show up at the barber it's also easier to show a photo of the haircut that you want than to describe it. For example:</p>\n<p>Write me a cold-email to SaaS CEOs for my experts in plain text between 200 and 300 words. Make it look like this:</p>\n<p>Example 1:</p>\n<p>Example 2:</p>\n<p>And avoid this:<br />\nExample 3:</p>\n<p>Telling ChatGPT what you don't want is also very effective when you showcase examples. You want to refine its playing field, leading more likely to your ideal outcome. </p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><strong>3. Ask it to take it step-by-step</strong></p>\n<p>One of my odd findings was that if you ask ChatGPT to slow down and not rush its job, you get a better outcome. </p>\n<p>Also ask ChatGPT to ask you follow-up questions if it would like more information to understand you, or do its job better. 9/10 ChatGPT will ask you questions that eventually lead to a much better outcome.</p>\n<p><strong>Other tips/observations:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>When your chat becomes too big it's better to start over instead of trying to get the answers you want. There is a higher chance of hallucination and it will take more effort to finetune it. </li>\n<li>You can ask for a summary of the Chat so you don't have to completely start over, but that at least ChatGPT has a fresh start with context. </li>\n<li>In general GPT-4 is smarter but Claude is way better at writing. It writes naturally and engaging. It's hard to make ChatGPT write naturally and engaging, but the insights are mostly on point. So what I usually do is create something first in ChatGPT and then rewrite it in Claude. </li>\n<li>Reasoning ChatGPT &gt; Claude</li>\n<li>Writing Claude &gt; ChatGPT</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Hope you found this useful!

This GPT automates the resume creation/updating process for an optimized acceptance rate.</p>\n<p><strong>The Idea</strong></p>\n<p>I frequently change jobs due to statistically proven benefits.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cAnother one in five of those surveyed saw <strong>pay increases between 10 and 20 percent</strong> when switching companies.\u201d   </p>\n<p>[Source 1]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Every time, I've noticed a recurring theme: the daunting task of updating resumes for multiple job applications. This challenge led me down an interesting path of experimentation, and now, I'm thrilled to announce the public release of my resume creation GPT (alpha). </p>\n<p><strong>GPT:</strong> <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/g/g-mOVLb8GqB-custom-resume\"><strong>https://chat.openai.com/g/g-mOVLb8GqB-custom-resume</strong></a></p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p>\n<p>The process is straightforward and user-friendly. You have two options: start from scratch by having a conversation with the GPT, which guides you through creating a new resume, or upload an existing one for updating in relation to a new job offer. As you interact with the GPT, it tailors your resume accordingly. At the end of the process, you'll receive a secure download link with a password, allowing you to safely download your updated resume.</p>\n<p><strong>Privacy and Data Security</strong> </p>\n<p>Your privacy is a top priority. I do not have access to any of your data. All information is encrypted and stored solely for the purpose of enabling you to download your resume. This data expires and is permanently deleted after three months, in line with my stringent privacy policy, which can be found at<a href=\"https://jobdraft.ai/privacy-policy\"> https://jobdraft.ai/privacy-policy</a></p>\n<p><strong>(Problem) - Seeking Feedback</strong> </p>\n<p>Due to the privacy policy, I cannot access any resume generation data, except for my own tests. This limits my ability to assess the effectiveness of the GPT tool. Therefore, I would greatly appreciate if you could share your experiences, resumes, or other feedback with me directly. Your input is invaluable for improving this tool and validating its utility. </p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><em>Sources:</em> </p>\n<p><em>1-</em> <a href=\"https://ivyexec.com/career-advice/2023/does-job-hopping-really-earn-you-a-higher-salary\"><em>https://ivyexec.com/career-advice/2023/does-job-hopping-really-earn-you-a-higher-salary</em></a> </p>",

We, the employees of OpenAI, have developed the best models and pushed the field to new frontiers. Our work on AI safety and governance shapes global norms. The products we built are used by millions of people around the world. Until now, the company we work for and cherish has never been in a stronger position.  </p>\n<p>The process through which you terminated Sam Altman and removed Greg Brockman from the board has jeopardized all of this work and undermined our mission and company. Your conduct has made it clear you did not have the competence to oversee OpenAI.  </p>\n<p>When we all unexpectedly learned of your decision, the leadership team of OpenAI acted swiftly to stabilize the company. They carefully listened to your concerns and tried to cooperate with you on all grounds. Despite many requests for specific facts for your allegations, you have never provided any written evidence. They also increasingly realized you were not capable of carrying out your duties, and were negotiating in bad faith.  </p>\n<p>The leadership team suggested that the most stabilizing path forward - the one that would best serve our mission, company, stakeholders, employees and the public - would be for you to resign and put in place a qualified board that could lead the company forward in stability.  </p>\n<p>Leadership worked with you around the clock to find a mutually agreeable outcome. Yet within two days of your initial decision, you again replaced interim CEO Mira Murati against the best interests of the company. You also informed the leadership team that allowing the company to be destroyed \u201cwould be consistent with the mission.\u201d  </p>\n<p>Your actions have made it obvious that you are incapable of overseeing OpenAI. We are unable to work for or with people that lack competence, judgement and care for our mission and employees. We, the undersigned, may choose to resign from OpenAI and join the newly announced Microsoft subsidiary run by Sam Altman and Greg Brockman. Microsoft has assured us that there are positions for all OpenAI employees at this new subsidiary should we choose to join. We will take this step imminently, unless all current board members resign, and the board appoints two new lead independent directors, such as Bret Taylor and Will Hurd, and reinstates Sam Altman and Greg Brockman.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>",

We\u2019re all enthusiastic and personally invested in applying cutting edge tech to new product designs. We\u2019re no stranger to implementing automation and software services in our jobs. So why am I the only one who seems to care about ChatGPT?</p>\n<p>I\u2019m, like, offended on ChatGPT (and all LLMs) behalf that my friends, family, and co-workers just don\u2019t seem to grasp the importance of this breakthrough tool. I feel like they treat it like the latest social networking app and they\u2019ll get around to looking at it eventually, once everyone else is using it. I\u2019ve found myself getting to the point of literally yelling (emphatically, not aggressively) at my friends and coworkers to please please please just start playing the free version with it to get comfortable with it. And also give me a good reason why you won\u2019t spend $20 to use the culmination of all of humanity\u2019s technological development\u2026 but you won\u2019t think twice about dropping $17 on a craft beer.</p>\n<p>I told my boss I would pay for a month of Plus subscriptions for my entire team <strong>out of my own pocket</strong> if they\u2019d just promise to try using it (prior to OpenAI halting new Plus accounts this morning). I told him \u201cTHAT\u2019s how enthusiastic I am about them learning to use the tool\u201d, but it was just met with a \u201cwow, you really are excited about this, huh?\u201d</p>\n<p>I proactively asked HR if I could give a company wide presentation on the various ways practical, time saving ways that I\u2019ve been able to utilize ChatGPT with the expressly stated intention of demystifying it and getting coworkers excited to use the tool. I don\u2019t feel like it moved the needle much.</p>\n<p>Even my IT staff are somewhat luke warm on the topic.</p>\n<p>Like, what the hell is going on? Am I (and the rest of us in this sub) really that much of an outlier within the tech community that we\u2019re still considered the early adopters?</p>\n<p>I\u2019m constantly torn between feeling like I\u2019m already behind the curve for not integrating this into my daily life fast enough and feeling like I\u2019m taking crazy pills because people are treating this like some annoying homework that they\u2019ll be forced to figure out against their will someday in the future.</p>\n<p>Now that OpenAI has stopped accepting new Plus accounts, I\u2019ll admit I\u2019m experiencing a bit of schadenfreude. I tried to help them, but they didn\u2019t want to be helped and now they lost their chance. If this pause on new Plus accounts goes on for more than a couple of weeks, it\u2019s going to really widen the gap between those who are fluent with all of the Plus features, and everyone else. </p>\n<p>If we were already the early adopters, we\u2019re about to widen our lead.</p>",

Some of my experiences have me wondering \"What's the point?\"</p>\n<p>While checking out a few of OpenAI's customized GPTs, I asked them relevant, targeted questions and then asked regular ChatGPT4 the same questions.  In some cases, regular ChatGPT4 gave me superior advice than the so-called specialized engines.  Regular ChatGPT4 gave me objectively better advice about getting a stain out (a real problem I have at the moment) than the \"Laundry Buddy\" GPT.</p>\n<p>Then, here's the real kicker, I asked \"Laundry Buddy\" how to become president of the United States and it gladly told me.  It did qualify itself and say that it was mainly a laundry expert, but then lauded me for my lofty goals and told me the exact process, rules, laws, etc. to become the President.</p>\n<p>Hot Mods freely told me the history of Portugal at my request and didn't even qualify itself about being an image generator.</p>\n<p>DALL-E gladly told me how hand cream could help my chapped hands without qualification or hesitation.</p>\n<p>So basically if any customized GPT can answer any question, what's the point of putting a pretty package on the outside when the backend is identical?  Why cut yourself off at the knees claiming to be a specialized GPT when ChatGPT4 has access to all the same knowledge?</p>\n<p>Is your uploaded data really enough to make that much of a difference?</p>\n<p>edit: spelling</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>",

The app is completely free and does not require registration. Please share your thoughts on this idea, and suggest any new features you think I should implement!  </p>\n<p>Exciting Features:<br />\n<strong>\u2022 Speak to Write:</strong> with this feature, you can speak your thoughts or information and the tool will transcribe it into text. The best part? You can then forward the transcribed text to any application with just one click. For example, you could set up an automatic export feature for your Notion account.  </p>\n<p><strong>\u2022 Audio to Action Plan:</strong> the service can transform a received audio message into a structured list of elements or bullet points. This feature is especially useful for outlining an action plan or item list.</p>\n<p><strong>\u2022 Speak in any Language:</strong> you can dictate an audio message in your native language, and the service will translate it into any other language, maintaining high translation quality\u2014significantly better than Google Translate.  </p>\n<p><strong>\u2022 Meeting Transcripts &amp; Summaries:</strong> the service is perfect for converting recorded audio from meetings into text and generating concise summaries. It supports the upload of users' files.  </p>\n<p>Thank you for taking the ti me to check it out. I look forward to hearing your feedback. You can access the service by visiting this link: <a href=\"https://audionotes.ai/\">https://audionotes.ai</a> \ud83d\ude4f</p>",
