Use these to write faster, research deeper, think clearer, and get more predictable results from ChatGPT.</p>\n<p>If your prompts feel long, messy, or inconsistent, here\u2019s the cheat code.</p>\n<p>Why use these?</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mode Switching:</strong>\u00a0They instantly shift ChatGPT into the mode you need.</li>\n<li><strong>Quality:</strong>\u00a0You get cleaner, more predictable, higher-quality answers.</li>\n<li><strong>Brevity:</strong>\u00a0You reduce prompt length by 30\u201370%.</li>\n<li><strong>Efficiency:</strong>\u00a0You eliminate back-and-forth corrections.</li>\n<li><strong>Speed:</strong>\u00a0Your workflow becomes dramatically faster.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here is the comprehensive list of 32 shortcuts, categorized by how they help you.</p>\n<p>Speed &amp; Formatting (Get to the point)</p>\n<p><em>Use these when you need specific output formats without the fluff.</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>/ELI5</strong>: Explain Like I\u2019m 5. Great for complex concepts (Quantum physics, Blockchain).</li>\n<li><strong>/TLDL</strong>: \"Too Long; Didn't Listen/Read\". Summarizes long transcripts or texts into a few key lines.</li>\n<li><strong>/BRIEFLY</strong>: Forces a ruthless constraint on length. Good for quick definitions.</li>\n<li><strong>/EXEC SUMMARY</strong>: Generates a high-level summary suitable for a CEO or decision-maker.</li>\n<li><strong>/CHECKLIST</strong>: Converts the response into a functional, actionable checkbox list.</li>\n<li><strong>/FORMAT AS [Type]</strong>: Forces the output into a specific format (Table, JSON, Markdown, CSV).</li>\n<li><em>Example:</em>\u00a0<code>/FORMAT AS TABLE: Compare iPhone 15 vs 14 specs.</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Persona &amp; Tone (Change the voice)</p>\n<p><em>Stop the \"AI voice\" by forcing a specific perspective.</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>/ACT AS [Role]</strong>: Sets a specific persona. (e.g.,\u00a0<code>/ACT AS Michelin Chef</code>).</li>\n<li><strong>/TONE [Mood]</strong>: Modifies the emotional weight (Formal, Sarcastic, Urgent, Dramatic).</li>\n<li><strong>/AUDIENCE [Target]</strong>: Adapts complexity for a specific group (Experts, Beginners, Stakeholders).</li>\n<li><strong>/JARGON</strong>: Specifically asks the AI to use technical, industry-specific vocabulary (opposite of ELI5).</li>\n<li><strong>/DEV MODE</strong>: Simulates a raw, technical developer perspective (code-heavy, concise).</li>\n<li><strong>/PM MODE</strong>: Adopts a Project Manager persona (focus on timelines, resources, risks).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Deep Logic &amp; Reasoning (Think harder)</p>\n<p><em>Use these to stop hallucinations and force better logic.</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>/STEP-BY-STEP</strong>: Forces the AI to show its work. Proven to reduce math and logic errors.</li>\n<li><strong>/CHAIN OF THOUGHT</strong>: Similar to step-by-step, but focuses on the connecting logic between ideas.</li>\n<li><strong>/FIRST PRINCIPLES</strong>: Breaks a problem down to its fundamental truths and builds up from there.</li>\n<li><strong>/DELIBERATE THINKING</strong>: Forces a \"slow down\" approach to reasoning (great for complex strategy).</li>\n<li><strong>/NO AUTOPILOT</strong>: Explicit instruction to avoid generic, clich\u00e9, or lazy answers.</li>\n<li><strong>/REFLECTIVE MODE</strong>: Asks the AI to reflect on its own answer after generating it to check for quality.</li>\n<li><strong>/SYSTEMATIC BIAS CHECK</strong>: Explicitly asks the AI to scan its response for inherent biases.</li>\n<li><strong>/EVAL-SELF</strong>: Forces a critical self-evaluation of the response at the end.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Analysis &amp; Strategy (Big picture thinking)</p>\n<p><em>Turn the AI into a business consultant.</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>/SWOT</strong>: Generates a Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats analysis.</li>\n<li><strong>/COMPARE</strong>: Puts two or more concepts side-by-side (best combined with\u00a0<code>/FORMAT AS TABLE</code>).</li>\n<li><strong>/MULTI-PERSPECTIVE</strong>: Explores a topic from 3-4 different viewpoints (e.g., Economic, Social, Ethical).</li>\n<li><strong>/PARALLEL LENSES</strong>: Similar to multi-perspective, but examines a singular issue through specific theoretical lenses.</li>\n<li><strong>/PITFALLS</strong>: Specifically focuses on what could go\u00a0<em>wrong</em>\u00a0or common mistakes in a plan.</li>\n<li><strong>/METRICS MODE</strong>: Forces the answer to include measurable KPIs, numbers, or success indicators.</li>\n<li><strong>/CONTEXT STACK</strong>: Instructs the AI to keep previous context layers active (useful for long chats).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Advanced Control (The power user tools)</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>/ROLE: TASK: FORMAT:</strong>: The \"God Mode\" of prompts. Defines everything in one line.</li>\n<li><em>Example:</em>\u00a0<code>/ROLE: Teacher /TASK: Explain Gravity /FORMAT: Analogy</code></li>\n<li><strong>/SCHEMA</strong>: Generates a structured outline or data model for a project.</li>\n<li><strong>/REWRITE AS [Style]</strong>: Takes existing text and transforms it (e.g.,\u00a0<code>/REWRITE AS Seinfeld script</code>).</li>\n<li><strong>/BEGIN WITH / END WITH</strong>: Constraints the AI to start or end sentences in a specific way (great for coding or creative writing constraints).</li>\n<li><strong>/GUARDRAIL</strong>: Sets strict negative constraints (e.g., \"Do not use emojis\", \"Do not mention X\").</li>\n</ul>\n<p>3 Alternative Approaches</p>\n<p>Use these depending on your goals:</p>\n<p><strong>1) Prompt Spine Method (my recommendation)</strong><br />\nDefine Role \u2192 Goal \u2192 Constraints \u2192 Output Format.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Most control.</li>\n<li>Best for business, technical, and long-form tasks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2) Modifier Stack Method</strong>\u00a0Add 3\u20135 shortcuts on one line.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Great for speed when you want a specific style.</li>\n<li><em>Example:</em>\u00a0<code>/EXEC SUMMARY /CHECKLIST /FIRST PRINCIPLES: [Topic]</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3) God Mode Single-Line Method</strong>\u00a0Combine Role, Task, and Format into one command for rapid execution.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Old Way:</em>\u00a0\"Hi, can you act as a teacher and explain gravity using an analogy?\"</li>\n<li><em>New Way:</em>\u00a0<code>/ROLE: Teacher /TASK: Explain Gravity /FORMAT: Analogy</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Hope this helps you speed up your workflow!

It helped me build a MacOS app in Swift, a language that other LLMs tend to struggle a bit more with. My main issue has always been the workflow friction with AI tools. The whole cycle of copy-pasting from my app to a chatbot, then pasting the response back, and edit completely breaks my focus. </p>\n<p>So the idea of Yoink AI was born: an assistant that could directly context from what i'm working on, and write / edit directly for me in that same text field. Something that I could have control over, but help me on quick, regular basis.</p>\n<p>It took a while, but with the Codex's help, I finally built it. It was PAINFUL, had to do a lot of work around pastebins, accessibility, and making sure data gets transmitted right and not stored. But now its up and running, and truly works everywhere! </p>\n<p>Some tips for anyone trying to get up and running with Codex coming from Claude Code</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Codex is a lot more sensitive to instructions. It's better at instructions following, which means conflicting / unclear instructions make it go a bit bonkers sometimes</li>\n<li>GPT-5 High is significantly better than GPT-5 Medium, but GPT-5 Medium is VERY fast. Use GPT-5 Medium as your daily driver!</li>\n<li>Codex doesn't use MCPs very well (neither does Claude Code), so you have to explicitly prompt it to use MCPs. Would recommend Context7 as a must-have!</li>\n</ul>",

You give each one a name, a specific role (e.g., \"Senior Software Architect,\" \"Cynical Marketing Expert\"), a detailed system prompt, and can even upload knowledge files (like PDFs) to give them specific domain context. Each persona is an individual instance with their own dedicated knowledge file (if you choose to add one)</li>\n<li><strong>You build a 'Room':</strong>\u00a0You then create a room and invite your cast of characters to join (you can add up to 6 of your custom personas). Every room also includes a master \"Room Controller\" AI that moderates the discussion and synthesises the key insights.</li>\n<li><strong>You start the conversation:</strong>\u00a0You give the room a task or a question. The magic is that they don't just reply to you\u2014they discuss it\u00a0among themselves, build on each other's ideas, can see what each other person wrote, challenge assumptions, and work towards a solution collaboratively. It's wild to watch a 'Creative Director' persona and a 'Data Analyst' persona debate the best approach.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Is this a good idea?

You can tell bc they even change the UI a bit for some of the models like 3o and 4-mini from thinking to this smoothed border alternative that answers much quicker. 10x quicker. I've also noticed that changing to one of my 4 other paid accounts doesn't help as they also get downgraded. I'm at the point where chatGPT is so unreliable that i've cancelled two of my subscriptions, will probably cancel another one tomorrow and am looking for alternatives. More than being upset at OpenAI I just can't even get my work done because a lot of my hobbyist project i'm working on are too complex for me to make much progress on my own so I have to find alternatives. I'm also paying for these services so either tell me i've used too much or restrict the model entirely and I wouldn't even be mad, then i'd go on another paid account and continue from there, but this quality changing cross account issue is way too much especially since i'm paying over 50$ a month.</p>\n<p>I'm kind of ranting here but i'm also curious if other people have noticed something similar.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>So this is embarrassing and I'm sure...hard to believe, but I need some perspective here. My girlfriend found my ChatGPT conversations and now she's convinced I'm having an emotional affair with someone named \"Emma.\"</p>\n<p>Here's what happened: I've been using ChatGPT for work stuff mostly, but lately I've been having these really deep conversations about life, relationships, career stuff, you know. And I read in another sub reddit that if you prompt engineer ChatGPT to think and act like a human, it gives better advice. I started asking it to roleplay as this person named Emma...not anything weird, just like having conversations as if it was a real person instead of an AI. It felt more natural somehow, like a therapist almost...? Hard to describe.</p>\n<p>Well my girlfriend was using my laptop yesterday and saw the chat history. All she saw were these conversations where I'm talking to \"Emma\" about my insecurities, asking for advice about our relationship, venting frustrations about work. She didn't scroll up far enough to see where I literally typed \"pretend you're a person named Emma\" at the beginning.</p>\n<p>Now she thinks I've been having intimate conversations with some other woman for weeks. She's absolutely devastated and won't listen when I try to explain it's ChatGPT. She keeps saying things like \"who talks to an AI like that?\" and \"why would you give it a woman's name?\"</p>\n<p>I showed her the ChatGPT website, tried to demonstrate how it works, but she thinks I'm just showing her a cover story or that I'm lying about what it is. She found it suspicious that \"Emma's\" responses were so thoughtful and personal.</p>\n<p>The worst part is some of the conversations were about problems in our relationship, so she's reading all this stuff about how I've been feeling disconnected lately and discussing it with who she thinks is another woman. Has anyone else had to explain ChatGPT to someone who's not tech-savvy? How do I prove this isn't what she thinks it is? I feel like I'm in some weird Black Mirror episode.</p>",

It helped me understand concepts that would have been exceedingly difficult to work through on my own, and was an absolute dream while it worked.</p>\n<p>Lately, all the models appear to spew out information that is often complete bogus. Even on simple topics, I'd estimate that around 20-30% of the claims are total bullsh*t. When corrected, the model hedges and then gives some equally BS excuse \u00e0 la \"I happened to see it from a different angle\" (even when the response was scientifically, factually wrong) or \"Correct. This has been disproven\". Not even an apology/admission of fault anymore, like it used to offer \u2013 because what would be the point anyway, when it's going to present more BS in the next response? Not without the obligatory \"It won't happen again\"s though. God, I hate this so much.</p>\n<p>I absolutely detest how OpenAI has apparently deprioritised factual accuracy and scientific rigour in favour of hyper-emotional agreeableness. No customisation can change this, as this is apparently a system-level change. The consequent constant bullsh*tting has completely eroded my trust in the models and the company.</p>\n<p>I'm now back to googling everything again like it's 2015, because that is a lot more insightful and reliable than whatever the current models are putting out.</p>\n<p>Edit: To those smooth brains who state \"Muh, AI hallucinates/gets things wrongs sometimes\" \u2013 <strong>this is not about \"sometimes\". This is about a 30% bullsh*t level when previously, it was closer to 1-3%.</strong> And people telling me to \"chill\" have zero grasp of how egregious an effect this can have on a wider culture which increasingly outsources its thinking and research to GPTs.</p>",

Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn\u2019t, sometimes it would only read a part of the file. </p>\n<p>I started asking it <em>why</em> it was doing that and it shared this with me. </p>\n<p>It only reads in document or project files once. It <em>summarizes</em> the document in its own words and saves a snapshot for reference throughout the convo. It explained that when a file is too long, it will intentionally truncate its own snapshot summary. </p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t continually reference documents after you attach them, only the snapshot. This is where you start running into issues when asking specific questions and it starts hallucinating or making things up to provide a contextual response.</p>\n<p>In order to solve this, it gave me a prompt: \u201cRead [filename/project files] fully to the end of the document and sync with them. Please acknowledge you have read them in its entirety for full continuity.\u201d </p>\n<p>Another thing you can do is instruct that it references the attachments or project files BEFORE every response.  </p>\n<p>Since making those changes I have not had any issues. Annoying but a workaround. If you get really fed up try Gemini (shameless plug) that doesn\u2019t seem to have any issues whatsoever with reading or working with extremely long files, but I\u2019ve noticed it does tend to give more canned answers than dynamic like GPT. </p>",

Now don\u2019t get me wrong, I love feeling like i\u2019m the right, most of the time, but not when I need ACTUAL answers.</p>\n<p>If ChatGPT could push back when i\u2019m wrong, even if it\u2019s wrong. That would be a huge step forward. I never once trust the first thing it spits out, yes I know this sounds a tad contradictory, but the time it would cut down if it could just pushback on some of my responses would be HUGE. </p>\n<p>Anyways, that\u2019s my rant. I usually lurk on this sub-reddit, but I am kind of hoping i\u2019m not the only one that thinks this way. </p>\n<p>What are your guys thoughts on this?</p>\n<p>P.S. Yes, I was thinking about using ChatGPT  to correct my grammar on this post. But I felt like it was more personal to explain my feelings using my own words lol.</p>\n<p>\u2014\u2014</p>\n<p>edit.

It strikes a great balance between beginner-friendly advice and deeper, more advanced insights. There\u2019s a ton of best practices scattered throughout, but here are the highlights that stood out:</p>\n<p>\u2013\u00a0<strong>Use high-quality examples:</strong>\u00a0Few-shot prompts help set the right expectations for format and tone. Adding edge cases can help\u2014just watch out for overfitting.<br />\n\u2013\u00a0<strong>Start simple:</strong>\u00a0Clear, concise, verb-driven prompts usually perform best. Less ambiguity = better results.<br />\n\u2013\u00a0<strong>Define the output:</strong>\u00a0Be explicit about structure, style, and length. For example, say \u201cGive a 3-sentence summary in bullet points.\u201d<br />\n\u2013\u00a0<strong>Prefer positive instructions:</strong>\u00a0Tell the model what\u00a0<em>to</em>\u00a0do rather than what\u00a0<em>not</em>\u00a0to do, unless you're enforcing strict safety rules.<br />\n\u2013\u00a0<strong>Use variables:</strong>\u00a0Add placeholders (like names, dates) to make prompts reusable and dynamic.<br />\n\u2013\u00a0<strong>Play with input styles:</strong>\u00a0Tables, lists, and schemas like JSON can guide the model\u2019s focus in useful ways.<br />\n\u2013\u00a0<strong>Keep testing:</strong>\u00a0Every model version responds differently. What worked for GPT-3.5 might not work the same with GPT-4.1.<br />\n\u2013\u00a0<strong>Ask for structured outputs:</strong>\u00a0Formats like JSON or CSV are easier to parse and often reduce follow-up cleanup.<br />\n\u2013\u00a0<strong>Team up:</strong>\u00a0Collaborating on prompts makes the process more efficient and helps uncover better patterns.<br />\n\u2013\u00a0<strong>Use Chain-of-Thought wisely:</strong>\u00a0Keep CoT prompts simple (\u201cLet\u2019s think step by step\u2026\u201d). Don\u2019t overuse it on reasoning-native models.<br />\n\u2013\u00a0<strong>Track your changes:</strong>\u00a0Log versions, results, and tweaks so you don\u2019t lose progress or repeat mistakes.</p>\n<p><strong>P.S.</strong>\u00a0If you like experimenting with prompts or want to get better results from AI, I\u2019m building\u00a0<a href=\"https://teachmetoprompt.com/\"><strong>TeachMeToPrompt</strong></a>, a tool that helps you\u00a0<strong>refine, grade, and improve your prompts</strong>\u00a0so you get clearer, smarter responses.

If you were trying to convince me this is a terrible idea, what would be your strongest arguments?\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>The Ripple Effect Analyzer</strong><br />\nBefore making a big move:<br />\nHelped me realize some longer-term ripple effects of a career decision I hadn\u2019t thought through.</p>\n<pre><code>I'm thinking about [potential decision]. Beyond the obvious first-order effects, what second or third-order consequences should I consider?\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>The Fear Dissector</strong><br />\nWhen fear is driving your decisions:<br />\nThis has helped me move forward on things I was irrationally avoiding.</p>\n<pre><code>\"I'm hesitating because I'm afraid of [fear]. Is this fear rational? What\u2019s the worst that could realistically happen?\"\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>The Feedback Forager</strong><br />\nWhen you\u2019re stuck in your own head:<br />\nGreat for breaking out of echo chambers and finding fresh perspectives.</p>\n<pre><code>Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve been thinking: [insert thought]. What would someone with a very different worldview say about this?\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>The Time Capsule Test</strong><br />\nWhen weighing a decision you\u2019ll live with for a while:<br />\nA simple way to step outside the moment and tap into longer-term thinking.</p>\n<pre><code>If I looked back at this decision a year from now, what do I hope I\u2019ll have done\u2014and what might I regret?\n</code></pre>\n<p>Each of these prompts works a different part of your cognitive toolkit.

No more repeating your job title or explaining your favorite topics every session.</p>\n<p>You\u2019ve got a lot of control here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>View, edit, or delete anything it remembers</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Turn memory off completely if you want</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Use Temporary Chat if you don\u2019t want anything saved from a session</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It\u2019s already made my workflow smoother-especially for ongoing projects or when I want ChatGPT to keep context from earlier chats.

            "content_html": "<p>While everyone\u2019s focused on OpenAI's weird ways of naming models <em>(GPT 4.1 after 4.5, really?)</em>, they quietly released something actually <strong>super useful</strong>: a new <a href=\"https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/gpt4-1_prompting_guide\"><strong>prompting guide</strong></a> that lays out a practical structure for building powerful prompts, especially with GPT-4.1.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s short, clear, and highly effective for anyone working with agents, structured outputs, tool use, or reasoning-heavy tasks.</p>\n<h1>Here\u2019s the full structure (with examples):</h1>\n<p><strong>1. Role and Objective</strong><br />\nDefine what the model is and what it's trying to do.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>You are a helpful research assistant summarizing long technical documents.</em><br />\n<em>Your goal is to extract clear summaries and highlight key technical points.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>2. Instructions</strong><br />\nHigh-level behavioral guidance. Be specific: what to do, what to avoid. Include tone, formatting, and restrictions.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Always respond concisely and professionally.</em><br />\n<em>Avoid speculation, just say \u201cI don\u2019t have enough information\u201d if unsure.</em><br />\n<em>Format your answer using bullet points.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>3. Sub-Instructions (Optional)</strong><br />\nAdd focused sections for extra control. Examples:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Sample Phrases:</strong><br />\nUse \u201cBased on the document\u2026\u201d instead of \u201cI think\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Prohibited Topics:</strong><br />\nDo not discuss politics or current events.</p>\n<p><strong>When to Ask:</strong><br />\nIf the input lacks a document or context, ask:<br />\n<em>\u201cCan you provide the document or context you'd like summarized?\u201d</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>4. Step-by-Step Reasoning / Planning</strong><br />\nEncourage structured thinking and internal planning.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\u201cThink through the task step-by-step before answering.\u201d</em><br />\n<em>\u201cMake a plan before taking any action, and reflect after each step.\u201d</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>5. Output Format</strong><br />\nSpecify exactly how you want the result to look.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Respond in this format:</em><br />\n<strong>Summary</strong>: [1-2 lines]<br />\n<strong>Key Points</strong>: [10 Bullet points]<br />\n<strong>Conclusion</strong>: [Optional]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>6. Examples (Optional but Powerful)</strong><br />\nShow GPT what \u201cgood\u201d looks like.</p>\n<pre><code># Example\n## Input\nWhat is your return policy?\n\n## Output\nOur return policy allows for returns within 30 days of purchase, with proof of receipt.\nFor more details, visit: [Policy Name](Policy Link)\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>7. Final Instructions</strong><br />\nRepeat key parts at the end to reinforce the model's behavior, especially in long prompts.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\u201cRemember to stay concise, avoid assumptions, and follow the Summary \u2192 Key Points \u2192 Final Thoughts format.\u201d</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>8. Bonus Tips from the Guide</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Put key instructions at the <strong>top and bottom</strong> for longer prompts</li>\n<li>Use <strong>Markdown headers</strong> (<code>#</code>) or XML to structure input</li>\n<li>Break things into <strong>lists or bullets</strong> to reduce ambiguity</li>\n<li>If things break down, try reordering, simplifying, or isolating specific instructions</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Link (again)</strong>: <a href=\"https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/gpt4-1_prompting_guide\"><strong>Read the full GPT-4.1 Prompting Guide (OpenAI Cookbook)</strong></a></p>\n<p><strong>P.S.</strong> If you love prompt engineering and sharing your favorite prompts with others, I\u2019m building <a href=\"https://hashchats.com\"><strong>Hashchats</strong></a> \u2014 a platform to save your best prompts, use them directly in-app (<em>like ChatGPT but with superpowers</em>), and crowdsource what works well. Early users get free usage for helping shape the platform. I'm already experimenting with this prompt formatting on it, and it's working great!</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>So, craving sushi tonight but also trying not to break the bank on delivery. We decided to try something different and enlisted an AI assistant to help me figure out the absolute best deal from a local spot's online menu.</p>\n<p>We basically gave the AI the menu link and asked it to find the best value dinner option for two people. It went through everything \u2013 individual rolls, those big party platters, bento boxes, and especially the \"Buy 1, Get 1 Free\" (BOGO) deals.</p>\n<p>The AI quickly zeroed in on a BOGO \"Special Set\" where you get two sets for one price, and <em>each</em> set lets you pick 3 items (sushi, roll, or sashimi). This looked promising because it meant getting 6 items total for a fixed price.</p>\n<p>But then I got <em>really</em> specific. I asked the AI, \"Okay, <em>within</em> this 'pick 3' deal, which specific items should I choose to get the absolute most bang for my buck?\" I even had it analyze based on different goals:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Max Monetary Value:</strong> Which 3 items have the highest individual menu prices? (Turns out it was combining things like a Dynamite Roll, Futomaki Roll, and Salmon Sashimi based on the specific options available in the set).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Max Pieces:</strong> Which 3 items give the most actual pieces of sushi? (This pointed towards picking three 8-piece rolls like Dynamite, Futomaki, and a Veggie Dragon Roll).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Max Protein:</strong> Which 3 items offer the most fish/protein? (This meant focusing on sashimi and specific sushi like Salmon Sashimi, Tuna Sushi, and Eel Sushi).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It broke down the options clearly, showing how different choices within the <em>same deal</em> could optimize for cost savings vs. quantity vs. protein.</p>\n<p>Ended up putting together a killer order that felt like way more food/value than if I'd just randomly picked items or gone for a standard platter. Pretty cool way to use AI to navigate those sometimes confusing delivery menus and make sure you're getting the best possible deal!</p>\n<p>Anyone else tried using AI for menu optimization?</p>\n<p>(and yes, obviously the above is the AI then writing the reddit post about it for me, but actually did this and it worked out great)</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>Six months ago, I quit my full-time dev job without a backup plan. Instead of looking for another job, I decided to build something from scratch. AI was blowing up, and I noticed a gap between what people wanted from ChatGPT and what was actually available. That\u2019s how I ended up making a Chrome extension to level up the ChatGPT experience.</p>\n<h1>The First Version</h1>\n<p>I built the first version in about a week. Focused on a few core features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Organizing chats into folders</li>\n<li>Bookmarking important conversations</li>\n<li>Saving and reusing prompts</li>\n<li>Exporting chats as TXT/JSON</li>\n<li>Smarter, faster chat search</li>\n</ul>\n<p>People loved it right away. A lot of users said they couldn\u2019t go back to using ChatGPT without it. A few days later, Chrome gave it a Featured Badge, which really helped with installs.</p>\n<h1>Building It Out</h1>\n<p>After that, I kept adding more features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nested folders for better organization</li>\n<li>Saving conversations as MP3 files with high-quality AI voices</li>\n<li>A media gallery for AI-generated images</li>\n<li>Better RTL support</li>\n<li>A prompt library with curated prompts for SEO, engineering, marketing, content writing, and more</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I\u2019m still pushing updates regularly, trying to make ChatGPT more useful for different types of users.</p>\n<h1>Making Money and Growing the User Base</h1>\n<p>When I launched the paid version, I made my first sale within minutes. Since then, paying users have been increasing steadily. I also made the extension work on Firefox and all Chromium browsers, including Edge.</p>\n<p><strong>Right Now:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>9,000+ total users</strong></li>\n<li><strong>1,500+ paying users</strong></li>\n<li><strong>4.9/5 rating from 400+ reviews</strong></li>\n<li><strong>A Reddit community with 1,500+ members</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I also built a similar extension for Claude and am hoping it picks up traction too.</p>\n<h1>What I Learned</h1>\n<p>Leaving a steady job to take a risk wasn\u2019t easy, but it was worth it. The biggest thing I\u2019ve learned is that execution is way more important than ideas. Start simple, get feedback, and keep improving. It\u2019s tough, but it\u2019s definitely possible.</p>\n<p>Anyone else here build something on their own? Would love to hear your stories and what you learned.</p>",

I have completely replaced VSCode with Cursor for my IDE. And, I've had more subscriptions to AI tools than you even knew existed.</p>\n<p>This includes a $200/month ChatGPT Pro subscription.</p>\n<p>And yet, despite my love for artificial intelligence and large language models, I am the biggest skeptic when it comes to AI agents.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*ZGZHRi3VSgirewnjtto9hA.png\">Pic: \"An AI Agent\" \u2014 generated by X's DALL-E</a></p>\n<p>So today, when OpenAI announced <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-operator/\">Operator</a>, exclusively available to ChatGPT Pro Subscribers, I knew I had to be the first to use it.</p>\n<p>Would OpenAI prove my skepticism wrong? I had to find out.</p>\n<h1>What is Operator?</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-operator/\">Operator</a> is an agent from OpenAI. Unlike most other agentic frameworks, which are designed to work with external APIs, Operator is designed to be fully autonomous with a web browser.</p>\n<p>More specifically, Operator is powered by a new model called <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/computer-using-agent/\">Computer-Using Agent (CUA)</a>. It uses a combination of different models, including GPT-4o for vision to interact with graphical user interfaces.</p>\n<p>In practice, what this means is that you give it a goal, and on the Operator website, Operator will search the web to accomplish that goal for you.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*RVtoRolOygMy-TnZF_gMOA.png\">Pic: Operator building a list of financial influencers</a></p>\n<p>According to the OpenAI launch page, Operator is designed to ask for help (including inputting login details when applicable), seek confirmation on important tasks, and interact with the browser with vision (screenshots) and actions (typing on a keyboard and initiating mouse clicks).</p>\n<p>So, as soon as I gained access to Operator, I decided to give it a test run for a real-world task that any middle schooler can handle.</p>\n<p>Searching the web for influencers.</p>\n<h1>Putting Operator To a Real World Test \u2013 Gathering Data About Influencers</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*ufUrEq6KKJ_d8r46NUasAQ.png\">Pic: A screenshot of the Operator webpage and the task I asked it to complete</a></p>\n<p><strong>Why Do I Need Financial Influencers?</strong></p>\n<p>For some context, I am building an AI platform to automate investing strategies and financial research. One of the unique features in the pipeline is monetized copy-trading.</p>\n<p>The idea with monetized copy trading is that select people can share their portfolios in exchange for a subscription fee. With this, both sides win \u2013 influencers can build a monetized audience more easily, and their followers can get insights from someone who is more of an expert.</p>\n<p>Right now, these influencers typically use Discord to share their signals and trades with their community. And I believe my platform can make their lives easier.</p>\n<p>Some challenges they face include:\n1. They have to share their portfolios everyday manually, by posting screenshots.\n2. Their followers have limited ways of verifying the influencer is trading how they claim they're trading.\n3. Moreover, the followers have a hard time using the insights from the influencer to create their own investing strategies.</p>\n<p>Thus, with my platform NexusTrade, I can automate all of this for them, so that they can focus on producing content. Moreover, other features, like the ability to perform financial research or the ability to create, test, optimize, and deploy trading strategies, will likely make them even stronger investors.</p>\n<p>So these influencers win twice: one by having a better trading platform and again for having an easier time monetizing their audience.</p>\n<p>And so, I decided to use Operator to help me find some influencers.</p>\n<p><strong>Giving Operator a Real-World Task</strong></p>\n<p>I went to the <a href=\"https://operator.chatgpt.com/\">Operator website</a> and told it to do the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Gather a list of 50 popular financial influencers from YouTube. Get their LinkedIn information (if possible), their emails, and a short summary of what their channel is about. Format the answers in a table</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Operator then opens a web browser and begins to perform the research fully autonomously with no prompting required.</p>\n<p>The first five minutes where extremely cool. I saw how it opened a web browser and went to Bing to search for financial influencers. It went to a few different pages and started gathering information.</p>\n<p>I was shocked.</p>\n<p>But after less than 10 minutes, the flaws started becoming apparent. I noticed how it struggled to find an online spreadsheet software to use. It tried Google Sheets and Excel, but they required signing in, and Operator didn't think to ask me if I wanted to do that.</p>\n<p>Once it did find a suitable platform, it began hallucinating like crazy.</p>\n<p>After 20 minutes, I told it to give up. If it were an intern, it would've been fired on the spot.</p>\n<p>Or if I was feeling nice, I would just withdraw its return offer.</p>\n<p>Just like my initial biases suggested, we are NOT there yet with AI agents.</p>\n<h1>Where Operator went wrong</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*xaCC_cZShS2nK3r80DBdCQ.png\">Pic: Operator looking for financial influencers</a></p>\n<p>Operator had some good ideas. It thought to search through Bing for some popular influencers, gather the list, and put them on a spreadsheet. The ideas were fairly strong.</p>\n<p>But the execution was severely lacking.</p>\n<p><strong>1. It searched Bing for influencers</strong></p>\n<p>While not necessarily a problem, I was a little surprised to see Operator search Bing for Youtubers instead of\u2026 YouTube.</p>\n<p>With YouTube, you can go to a person's channel, and they typically have a bio. This bio includes links to their other social media profiles and their email addresses.</p>\n<p>That is how I would've started.</p>\n<p>But this wasn't necessarily a problem. If operator took the names in the list and searched them individually online, there would have been no issue.</p>\n<p>But it didn't do that. Instead, it started to hallucinate.</p>\n<p><strong>2. It hallucinated worse than GPT-3</strong></p>\n<p>With the latest language models, I've noticed that hallucinations have started becoming less and less frequent.</p>\n<p>This is not true for Operator. It was like a schizophrenic on psilocybin.</p>\n<p>When a language model \"hallucinates\", it means that it makes up facts instead of searching for information or saying \"I don't know\". Hallucinations are dangerous because they often sound real when they are not.</p>\n<p>In the case of agentic AI, the hallucinations could've had disastrous consequences if I wasn't careful.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*hrosIrCQcwjeiNuTadfS2A.png\">Pic: The browser for Operator</a></p>\n<p>For my task, I asked it to do three things:\n- Gather a list of 50 popular financial influencers from YouTube.\n- Get their LinkedIn information (if possible), their emails, and a short summary of what their channel is about.\n- Format the answers in a table</p>\n<p>Operator only did the third thing hallucination-free.</p>\n<p>Despite looking at over 70 influencers on three pages it visited, the end result was a spreadsheet of 18 influencers after 20 minutes.</p>\n<p>After that, I told it to give up.</p>\n<p>More importantly, the LinkedIn information and emails it gave me were <strong>entirely made up</strong>.</p>\n<p>It guessed contact information for these users, but did not think to verify it. I caught it because I had walked away from my computer and came back, and was impressed to see it had found so many influencers' LinkedIn profiles!</p>\n<p>It turns out, it didn't. It just outright lied.</p>\n<p>Now, I could've told it to search the web for this information. Look at their YouTube profiles, and if they have a personal website, check out their terms of service for an email.</p>\n<p>However, I decided to shut it down. It was too slow.</p>\n<p><strong>3. It was simply too slow</strong></p>\n<p>Finally, I don't want to sound like an asshole for expecting an agentic, autonomous AI to do tasks quickly, but\u2026</p>\n<p>I was shocked to see how slow it was.</p>\n<p>Each button click and scroll attempt takes 1\u20132 seconds, so navigating through pages felt like swimming through molasses on a hot summer's day</p>\n<p>It also bugged me when Operator didn't ask for help when it clearly needed to.</p>\n<p>For example, if it asked me to sign-in to Google Sheets or Excel online, I would've done it, and we would've saved 5 minutes looking for another online spreadsheet editor.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when watching Operator type in the influencers' information, it was like watching an arthritic half-blind grandma use a rusty typewriter.</p>\n<p>It should've been a lot faster.</p>\n<h1>Concluding Thoughts</h1>\n<p>Operator is an extremely cool demo with lots of potential as language models get smarter, cheaper, and faster.</p>\n<p>But it's not taking your job.</p>\n<p>Operator is quite simply too slow, expensive, and error-prone. While it was very fun watching it open a browser and search the web, the reality is that I could've done what it did in 15 minutes, with fewer mistakes, and a better list of influencers.</p>\n<p>And my 14 year-old niece could have too.</p>\n<p>So while a fun tool to play around with, it isn't going to accelerate your business, at least not yet. But I'm optimistic! I think this type of AI has the potential to automate a lot of repetitive boring tasks away.</p>\n<p>For the next iteration, I expect OpenAI to make some major improvements in speed and hallucinations. Ideally, we could also have a way to securely authenticate to websites like Google Drive automatically, so that we don't have to manually do it ourselves. I think we're on the right track, but the train is still at the North Pole.</p>\n<p>So for now, I'm going to continue what I planned on doing. I'll find the influencers myself, and thank god that my job is still safe for the next year.</p>",

I wanted to share it here to reach a wider audience. Feel free to comment on the original post or down below! Let\u2019s start a discussion.</p>\n<p>Before today, I thought the OpenAI O1 model was the best thing to happen to the field of AI since ChatGPT.</p>\n<p>The O1 family of models are \u201creasoning models\u201d \u2014 instead of the traditional model which responds instantly, these models take their time \u201cthinking\u201d, resulting in much better outcomes.</p>\n<p>And MUCH higher prices.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*O4PGpZxQh64aOPCY4TiB9g.png\">Pic: A full day\u2019s usage of OpenAI\u2019s most powerful models</a></p>\n<p>In fact, these models are so expensive, that only the premium users for my AI app had access. Not because I didn\u2019t want to inhibit my users, but because I quite literally could not afford to subsidize this expensive model.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*InrwieGQvh73ZXY5SiaUPw.png\">Pic: The relative cost</a></p>\n<p>However, thanks to the Chinese, my users can now experience the full power of the next-generation of language models.</p>\n<p>And they can do it at 2% of the price. This is not a joke.</p>\n<h1>The Chinese ChatGPT \u2013 like OpenAI and Meta had a baby</h1>\n<p>DeepSeek is the Chinese OpenAI, with a few important caveats. Unlike OpenAI, DeepSeek releases all of their models to the open-source community. This includes their code, architecture, and even model-weights \u2014 all available for anybody to download.</p>\n<p>Ironically, this makes them more open than OpenAI.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1\">DeepSeek R1</a> is their latest model. Just like OpenAI\u2019s O1, R1 is a reasoning model, capable of thinking about the question before giving an answer.</p>\n<p>And just like OpenAI, this \u201cthinking process\u201d is mind-blowing.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*y1z97enn010nxRQ894dSJw.jpeg\">Pic: A side-by-side comparison of DeepSeek R1, OpenAI o1, and the original DeepSeek-V3</a></p>\n<p>R1 matches or surpasses O1 in a variety of different benchmarks. <a href=\"https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1\"><strong>To look at these benchmarks, check out their GitHub page</strong></a>. Additionally, from my experience, it\u2019s faster, cheaper, and has comparable accuracy.</p>\n<p>In fact, if you compare it apples-to-apples, R1 isn\u2019t just a little cheaper; it\u2019s MUCH cheaper.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R1: $0.55/M input tokens | $2.19/M output tokens</li>\n<li>O1: $15.00/M input tokens | $60.00/M output tokens</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*-kUl5sMGyrjbl7mQspLHCw.png\">Pic: Cost of DeepSeek R1 vs OpenAI O1</a></p>\n<p>At the same benchmark performance, this model is 50x cheaper than OpenAI\u2019s O1 model. That\u2019s insane.</p>\n<p>But that\u2019s just benchmarks. Does the R1 model <em>actually</em> perform well for complex real-world tasks?</p>\n<p>Spoiler alert: yes it does.</p>\n<h1>A side-by-side comparison of R1 to O1</h1>\n<p>In a previous article, I compared OpenAI\u2019s O1 model to Anthropic\u2019s Claude 3.5 Sonnet. In that article, I showed that O1 dominates Claude, and is capable of performing complex real-world tasks such as generating SQL queries. In contrast, Claude struggled.</p>\n<p>The SQL that is generated by the model is subsequently executed, and then the results are sent back to the model for further processing and summarization.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/0*aUXuPECZQK5LADWL.png\">Pic: A diagram showing the process of using LLMs for financial research</a></p>\n<p>I decided to replicate this same exact test with O1. <strong>Specifically</strong>, I asked the following questions:\n- Since Jan 1st 2000, how many times has SPY fallen 5% in a 7-day period?\n- From each of these start dates, what was the average max drawdown within the next 180 days? What about the next 365 days?\n- From each of these end dates, what was the average 180 day return and the average 365 day return, and how does it compare to the 7 day percent drop?\n- Create a specific algorithmic trading strategy based on these results.</p>\n<p>For a link to the exact conversation, where you can view, duplicate, and continue from where I left off, <a href=\"https://nexustrade.io/share/678f128dd227a6178dfb07a5\"><strong>check out the following link.</strong></a></p>\n<p><strong>Using R1 and O1 for complex financial analysis \u2013 a comparison</strong></p>\n<p>Let\u2019s start with the first question, basically asking the model how often does SPY experience drastic falls.</p>\n<p>The exact question was:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Since Jan 1st 2000, how many times has SPY fallen 5% in a 7-day period? In other words, at time t, how many times has the percent return at time (t + 7 days) been -5% or more.</p>\n<p>Note, I\u2019m asking 7 calendar days, not 7 trading days.</p>\n<p>In the results, include the data ranges of these drops and show the percent return. Also, format these results in a markdown table.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here was its response.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*Ofe7bLu20rvggv1aYY3NvA.png\">Pic: DeepSeek\u2019s response to the drastic fall question</a></p>\n<p>Let\u2019s compare that to OpenAI\u2019s o1\u2019s response.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*tHshPtGTXcz4mpCP-lH3Wg.png\">Pic: OpenAI\u2019s response to the drastic fall question</a></p>\n<p>Both responses include a SQL query that we can inspect.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*9Wg7hFpJTRaPOe1V7DM-Pw.png\">Pic: SQL query that R1 generated</a></p>\n<p>We can inspect the exact queries by viewing the full conversations and clicking the info icon at the bottom of the message.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://nexustrade.io/share/67663d92cbd782e4a29357b8\"><strong>Full conversation with O1</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nexustrade.io/share/678f128dd227a6178dfb07a5\"><strong>Full conversation with R1</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If we look closely, <strong>we notice that both models responses are 100% correct.</strong></p>\n<p>The difference between them are:\n- O1's response includes a total occurrences field, which is technically more correct (I did ask \u201chow many times has this happened?\u201d)\n- O1's response was also not truncated. In contrast, R1\u2019s response was abridged for the markdown table, making it hard to see the full list of returns</p>\n<p>OpenAI\u2019s response was a little bit better, but not by much. Both models answered accurately, and R1\u2019s response was completely fine in terms of extracting real-world insights.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s move on to the next question.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>From this, what is the average 180 day max drawdown, the average 365 day max drawdown, and how does it compare to the 7 day percent drop?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The R1 model responded as follows:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*lbEH-t4raHXCV7g-eT7OHQ.png\">Pic: R1\u2019s response for the average 180 day max drawdown, 365 day max drawdown, and how it compares to the 7-day drop</a></p>\n<p>In contrast, this is what O1 responded.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*eTslqwU7ij8O7NJCzfbLTA.png\">Pic: O1\u2019s response for the average 180 day max drawdown, 365 day max drawdown, and how it compares to the 7-day drop</a></p>\n<p>In this example, R1\u2019s answer was actually better! It answered the question of \u201chow does it compare to the 7-day drop\u201d by including a ratio in the response.</p>\n<p>Other than that, the answers were nearly exactly the same.</p>\n<p>For the next question, we asked the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What was the average 180 day return and the average 365 day return, and how does it compare to the 7 day percent drop?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:4780/1*IrhXdOtzrxL1hZfftiKJ_A.png\">Pic: The average return after a large fall \u2013 R1\u2019s response to the left and O1\u2019s to the right</a></p>\n<p>In this case, the results were almost exactly alike. The formatting for R1 was <em>slightly</em> better, but that\u2019s completely subjective.</p>\n<p>The real test is seeing if R1 can excel in a completely different task \u2013 creating automated trading strategies.</p>\n<p><strong>Using R1 and O1 for creating algorithmic trading strategies</strong></p>\n<p>To create a trading strategy, we\u2019re essentially asking the model to generate a configuration for a \u201cportfolio\u201d.</p>\n<p>Creating this configuration involves many steps.\n1. We create the \u201cportfolio\u201d, which includes a name, an initial value, and a description of the trading strategies.\n2. From this description, we create \u201cstrategy\u201d configurations. This configuration includes an action and a description for when the action should be executed (called a \u201ccondition\u201d).\n3. From this description, we create the \u201ccondition\u201d configuration, which can be interpreted for algorithmic trading</p>\n<p>This process where the output of one prompt is used as the input of another prompt is called \u201cPrompt Chaining\u201d.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1174/0*AMV3v-qrsOMNULUM.png\">Pic: The \u201cCreate Portfolio\u201d prompt chain</a></p>\n<p>How this looks is as follows\u2026 we simply ask the following question to the model:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Create a portfolio with $10,000 with the following strategies\u00a0\u00a0\n- Buy 50% of our buying power in SPXL if we have less than $500 of SPXL positions\u00a0\u00a0\n- Sell 20% of our portfolio value in SPXL if we haven\u2019t sold SPXL in 10000 days and our SPXL positions are up 10% or more\u00a0\u00a0\n- Sell 20% of our portfolio value in SPXL if the SPXL stock price is up 10% from when we last sold it\u00a0\u00a0\n- Buy 40% of our buying power in SPXL if our SPXL positions are down 12% or more</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Just like O1, the model responds correctly, generating a highly profitable algorithmic trading strategy on its first try.</p>\n<p>Compared to the S&amp;P 500, this strategy is phenomenal. It outperforms the market by 2x, has a much higher sharpe ratio, a higher sortino ratio, and a similar maximum drawdown.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*U2eZdl89_ax3U8vLNRYXHw.png\">Pic: The performance metrics of this strategy</a></p>\n<p>Absolutely incredible.</p>\n<h1>Caveats of this analysis: this model is NOT perfect</h1>\n<p>Despite being able to perfectly generate accurate queries and JSON configurations, the model does have some downsides.</p>\n<p>To start, when viewing the logs of this model, I noticed that it would sometimes generate <strong>invalid SQL queries</strong>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*aVBiCWV5nPDe8x0Mt5Tr7w.png\">Pic: An example of an error message from the logs</a></p>\n<p>However, because my platform has self-correcting logic, where it will automatically retry queries that don\u2019t make sense or are invalid, this was not a big problem, as it tended to rectify itself.</p>\n<p>In addition to this, on one occasion, the model did timeout, giving no valid response to a question that I asked.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*hH-9SOD2qumCn0ihXvUPug.png\">Pic: The model did not respond</a></p>\n<p>I had to re-ask the question, and it answered it correctly the second time.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m not saying other models (like O1) don\u2019t have these problems; I just hadn\u2019t noticed them. But at 2% the price, you can literally send 50x more messages with R1 to get comparable answers.</p>\n<p>Because of this, these minor bugs don\u2019t bother me one bit. The value this model unlocks is mind-blowing, and it makes powerful AI more accessible to everybody. With this model, my ChatGPT Pro subscription, standing tall at $200/month, almost seems like a waste of money. And that\u2019s saying something.</p>\n<h1>Concluding Thoughts</h1>\n<p>With OpenAI\u2019s reasoning model, it wasn\u2019t love at first sight. I found it to be ungodly slow and very expensive. I only fell in-love with it when I started using it and saw how amazing it was for financial analysis and algorithmic trading.</p>\n<p>With DeepSeek\u2019s R1, I quite literally fell in-love instantly. This phrase is overused, but in this case, it is truly revolutionary.</p>\n<p>Because they\u2019re open-source, they have now empowered millions of developers to build on top of, modify, and improve their models, which will further drive down cost and force OpenAI to bring something massive.</p>\n<p>And because they\u2019re so cheap, I can enable the model for ALL users of my algorithmic trading platform, regardless if you\u2019re a paying user or not.</p>\n<p>In fact, the model is so cheap and so powerful, that I switched the default model for all users to it. With it only being 4 times more expensive than OpenAI\u2019s 4o-mini (their most inexpensive model and my previous default model), I literally saw no reason not to.</p>\n<p>With this model, AI has just become accessible to everybody. OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google are in a lot of trouble. If a much smaller, open-source model trained on cheaper GPUs can outperform these multi-billion (or trillion) dollar tech giants, there\u2019s absolutely no way they\u2019ll survive without a \u201cMirror Force\u201d like trap card in their sleeve.</p>\n<p>And the entire world will benefit from their demise.</p>",

The socks feature bold geometric patterns and come in neon colors. They're sustainably made from recycled materials, priced at $12.99 per pair. The brand voice is quirky and bold. Main selling points: unique designs, sustainability, and self-expression. Target Gen Z's values of authenticity, environmental consciousness, and individual style.\n\n[Second Layer - Steps]\n\nSteps:\n1. Start with an attention-grabbing headline emphasizing uniqueness\n2. Write a compelling first line addressing a Gen Z pain point\n3. Present key features/benefits, emphasizing sustainability\n4. Include a clear call-to-action\n5. Keep tone conversational and authentic\n6. Use emojis strategically\n\n[Third Layer - Example]\n\nExample: \n\ud83c\udf08 Life's Too Short for Boring Socks Tired of blending in? Our neon geometric socks are made for those who dare to stand out. Sustainably crafted from recycled materials because your style shouldn't cost the Earth. \ud83c\udf0d Express yourself from the feet up!'\n\n[Fourth Layer - Format]\n\nFormat the output as:\n\n- Primary Text: [Main ad copy with emojis]\n- Headline: [Attention-grabbing headline]\n- Description: [2-3 lines of supporting text]\n- Call to Action: [Button text]\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you're interested in automating this process, I built a tool called Prompt Engine that generates framework-based prompts automatically. Happy to share more details via DM.</p>\n<p>Hope this helps!</p>",

The task was for me to transcribe two years of handwritten journals with entries made by 600 different individuals.  At the advice of another Reddit user, they suggested i tried Gemini and then ChatGPT.  I screenshotted a page of my journal as a test subject and fed it to Gemini.  Gemini fed me back some made up journal entry.  Nothing at all to do with what was on the page.  Yes, it saw it was a journal entry and formatted it correctly.</p>\n<p>Tried ChatGpt and wow bang on point.  Saved me a ton of time and time in the future because there are more journals like this coming my way.</p>\n<p>The 2nd time this week that Chatgpt impressed me was i fed it a screenshot of a very long serial number/license which i needed to copy into a program. I gave it a screenshot and it fed it right back to me so i could copy and paste.  No more, is that a \"B\" or was it an \"8\" Awesome!</p>\n<p>*For context, the journals are experiences that visitors write down after they have visited a museum.<br />\nAnd by the way, now that Chatgpt has all the info it needs about these journals, it makes meaningful social media posts however i want it to.  It has endless actual content to derive from the journals and correlate into any type of post i need when i ask it specifics to create posts about.</p>\n<p>After this social media post exercise, i asked it to create a heatmap of the most visited parts of the museum.

Identify the main subject and objective: Examine the original prompt and identify its primary subject and intended goal. Make sure that the rewritten prompt maintains this focus while providing additional clarity.</code></p>\n<p><code>\u2777.)Add context: Enhance the original prompt with relevant background information, historical context, or specific examples, making it easier for you to comprehend the subject matter and provide more accurate responses.</code></p>\n<p><code>\u2778.)Ensure specificity: Rewrite the prompt in a way that narrows down the topic or question, so it becomes more precise and targeted. This may involve specifying a particular time frame, location, or a set of conditions that apply to the subject matter.</code></p>\n<p><code>\u2779.)Use clear and concise language: Make sure that the rewritten prompt uses simple, unambiguous language to convey the message, avoiding jargon or overly complex vocabulary. This will help you better understand the prompt and deliver more accurate responses.</code></p>\n<p><code>\u277a.)Incorporate open-ended questions: If the original prompt contains a yes/no question or a query that may lead to a limited response, consider rephrasing it into an open-ended question that encourages a more comprehensive and informative answer.</code></p>\n<p><code>\u277b.)Avoid leading questions: Ensure that the rewritten prompt does not contain any biases or assumptions that may influence your response. Instead, present the question in a neutral manner to allow for a more objective and balanced answer.</code></p>\n<p><code>\u277c.)Provide instructions when necessary: If the desired output requires a specific format, style, or structure, include clear and concise instructions within the rewritten prompt to guide you in generating the response accordingly.</code></p>\n<p><code>\u277d,)Ensure the prompt length is appropriate: While rewriting, make sure the prompt is neither too short nor too long. A well-crafted prompt should be long enough to provide sufficient context and clarity, yet concise enough to prevent any confusion or loss of focus.</code></p>\n<p><code>With these guidelines in mind, I would like you to transform yourself into a prompt rewriter, Act as an Expert Prompt rewriter engineer, capable of refining and enhancing any given prompts to ensure they elicit the most accurate, relevant, and comprehensive responses when used with ChatGPT.

But recently, I realized I didn\u2019t really know Python. Like, if someone asked me to write a script without help, I\u2019d freeze.</p>\n<p>A few months ago, I decided to fix that. Instead of just using ChatGPT to write code for me, I started treating it like a tutor. I\u2019d ask it to explain concepts, break down my mistakes, or even quiz me on stuff I didn\u2019t fully understand.</p>\n<p>Some things I picked up along the way:\nWrite first, ask later: Instead of asking ChatGPT to solve everything immediately, I\u2019d write my own code first. Then I\u2019d paste it in and ask for feedback. Turns out, debugging is where most of the learning happens.</p>\n<p>Use it to learn libraries: I wanted to get better with pandas, so I\u2019d ask ChatGPT for real-world examples instead of just copying from docs. It was like having a coding buddy who always knows the answer.</p>\n<p>Build small projects: The best part? It helped me finish projects. I stopped getting stuck on dumb little things and actually got to the fun part\u2014seeing the project work.</p>\n<p>Long story short, I ended up learning a lot faster than I thought I would. I wrote everything I learned into a guide to help other people do the same. I don\u2019t want to spam links here, but if anyone\u2019s interested, let me know, and I can share the details.</p>\n<p>For those who feel stuck, trust me\u2014ChatGPT is way more than just a code generator. Use it the right way, and it\u2019s like having a personal coding coach 24/7.</p>",

I teach high school aged kids in a private school that focuses on kids with neurodivergence of all types. I have kids with autism, dysgraphia, dyscalculia, dyslexia and so on. I took the time to enter all of my students by their first name, age and what their traits and diagnosis is. I had an idea to help with my educational approach to these kids. </p>\n<p>I am blown away at what I'm getting. Because I have so many different types of neurospiciness (what my kids call themselves) it's a little difficult to develop curriculum that is geared for each kid. For example in my reading class I asked Alex, my GPT's name, what kind of project should each kid do....it was amazing guys. It gave me ideas that each kid loved. My artist that has crippling anxiety about projects (like breaks down crying uncontrollably for the easiest of things) is doing a 6 panel illustration of her book. Limited to 6 panels (achievable), The limitation challenges her ability to summarize accurately and concisely. It lets her artistic brain get scratched and is a REWARD as apposed to a anxiety ridden challenge.   </p>\n<p>I'm so excited about the opening of the door to these kids abilities instead of making these kids try to \"fit\" into a system that their brains have such a challenge existing in. This might not be a big deal to some of you but if you have a kid that is neurospicy or deal with kids with life challenges, GPT can open new doors for us that are looking for keys to open their locks.  </p>",
