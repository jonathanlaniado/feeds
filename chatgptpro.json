I quickly began using it for personal projects, and as soon as GPT-4 was released, I signed up without a second of hesitation. Shortly thereafter, as an automation engineer moving from Go to Python, and from classic front end and REST API testing to a heavy networking product, I found myself completely lost. BUT - ChatGPT to the rescue, and I found myself navigating the complex new reality with relative ease.</p>\n<p>I simply am constantly copy-pasting entire snippets, entire functions, entire function <em>trees</em>, climbing up the function hierarchy and having GPT just explain both the python code and syntax and networking in general. It excels as a teacher, as I simply query it to explain each and every concept, climbing up the conceptual ladder any time I don't understand something.</p>\n<p>Then when I need to write new code, I simply feed similar functions to GPT, tell it what I need, instruct it to write it using best-practice and following the conventions of my code base. It's incredible how quickly it spits it out.</p>\n<p>It doesn't always work at first, but then I simply have it add debug logging and use it to brainstorm for possible issues.</p>\n<p>I've done this to quickly implement tasks that would have taken me days to accomplish. Most importantly, it gives me the confidence that I can basically do anything, as GPT, with proper guidance, is a star developer.</p>\n<p>My manager is really happy with me so far, at least from the feedback I've received in my latest 1:1.</p>\n<p>The only thing that I struggle with is ethical - how much should I blur the information I copy-paste? I'm not actually putting any really sensitive there, so I don't think it's an issue. Obviously no api keys or passwords or anything, and it's testing code so certainly no core IP being shared.</p>\n<p>I've written elsewhere about how I've used this in my personal life, allowing me to build a <a href=\"https://therapywithai.com/\">full stack application</a>, but it's actually my professional life that has changed more.</p>",

The prompt would be something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>\"Write an announcement for LinkedIn that we have a new product launched at Org called Product X\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>And the output looks like:</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/rzeofker2jqc1.png?width=1292&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=29a7500ceb592bd33f199146d52b7d4903eec79a\">Checked via hemingwayapp.com</a></p>\n<p>The sentences are long full with complex words, the passive voice, and adverbs. </p>\n<p>Great for your English paper, terrible for writing on the internet.</p>\n<h1>Why simple writing matters</h1>\n<p>In the USA, 54% of adults have literacy below a 6th grade level. By using ChatGPT's default voice, you could lose out on connecting with a huge audience. The same is true in many other countries.</p>\n<p>So how can we make more impact with ChatGPT?</p>\n<p><strong>The answer is simple: write simply.</strong></p>\n<p>Consider what Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffet, and viral LinkedIn writers like Sahil Bloom have in common. They all write extremely simply, often at a 7th grade level on average.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/gowo1s443jqc1.png?width=1292&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f0f6f2fcc1b5d99b2d5dfd84d269df34bb7cb311</p>\n<p>Simple writing demonstrates clear thinking and the ability to make complex topics easy to grasp. That is a superpower.</p>\n<p>A simple trick to make ChatGPT write simple (without making it childish) is to add:</p>\n<pre><code>Write at a Flesch reading score of 80 or higher\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will result in output at a 6th grade level without sounding childish. It's perfect for business writing, which needs to be direct, concise and clear.</p>\n<p>If you want it to take one step further to create powerful and clear messages, try out the Power Writing prompt:</p>\n<pre><code>Use clear, direct language and avoid complex terminology.\nAim for a Flesch reading score of 80 or higher.\nUse the active voice.\nAvoid adverbs.\nAvoid buzzwords and instead use plain English.\nUse jargon where relevant.\nAvoid being salesy or overly enthusiastic and instead express calm confidence.\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will work wonders to make your writing simple, to the point, but not simplistic.</p>\n<p>If you enjoyed that please consider subscribing to my <a href=\"https://www.workwiz.ai/newsletter\">AI newsletter.</a> It's a weekly newsletter filled with value on how to work smarter with AI.</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>",

This project was designed to create educational summaries from videos submitted by users, aiming to improve their learning experience.</p>\n<p>With over 5000+ chats, the GPT was well-received, ranking 10th in the Education category. Some users were even euphoric about this solution. My role encompassed everything from backend development to testing, engaging with users, and refining their experience. I also personally funded its marketing and promotion.</p>\n<p>However, a sudden notification yesterday informed me of the GPT's removal from the store, without any specific reason. It hinted at a possible breach of the Terms of Service or Usage Policies, prompting me to carefully revise and correct any possible infractions.</p>\n<p>Despite this effort, today brought another unexplained removal notice, referring again to the same documents I had diligently reviewed. Notably, a legal expert I consulted identified no violations in my work.</p>\n<p>When the second notification arrived, I was only able to see its title on my phone, as the content wouldn't load. Once home, I accessed it on my laptop, only to find no detailed explanation for the removal and no possibility of restoring the GPT to the store or appealing the decision.</p>\n<p>This occurred even though there are copycats and similar GPTs in the store that clearly infringe on the 'YouTube' trademark in their GPT names and lack educational purposes, in contrast to my \"Video Summarizer AI\", yet they remain available.My aspiration was to actively contribute to the OpenAI Store's GPT development. This seems impossible now, given the unexplained removal of my project.</p>\n<p>If this is a final decision and not just a technical glitch, I urge Openai for transparency regarding any errors I might have made. Despite my earnest efforts, including legal consultation, the reason behind this decision remains a mystery.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/3x5bn83l22cc1.png?width=820&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c10be4adf0c5dfbd98df3332326f9cf016b8aad3</p>",

Little did she know at the time, that this would be the start to three grueling years of unexplainable pain for her 4-year old son, Alex.</p>\n<p>Alex had started feeling excruciating pain, and soon their nanny had begun administering Motrin (Advil, Ibuprofen, etc\u2026) daily to alleviate the intense agony and ease \u201cgigantic meltdowns\u201d. According to the mom, as long as he had some Motrin he would be fine. Courtney, obviously, grew increasingly concerned and decided it was time to get some professional help.</p>\n<p>It was at this time that Alex began vigorously chewing anything and everything, so Courtney brought him to a dentist to hopefully get some answers. It was possible that the boy's molars were coming in, but after ruling that out, they thought that cavities might be the culprit. Ruling those out, the dentist figured that he might be grinding his teeth and referred the family to an orthodontist who specialized in airway obstructions.</p>\n<p>If there was an airway obstruction while Alex was sleeping it could explain the moodiness and exhaustion throughout the day. At least that\u2019s what the dentist thought. After a trip to the orthodontist they confirmed that Alex\u2019s palette was too small for his mouth and his teeth. This was great news at the time as they had discovered what the issue was. Place an expander in and all would be good. Home stretch, right?</p>\n<p>Things started looking up for a bit, but then Courtney noticed that the boy wasn\u2019t growing anymore. After a concerned trip to their pediatrician, they discovered that his left and right side were imbalanced. Another referral later, and Alex is now going to physical therapy.</p>\n<p>Right before starting PT, Alex began experiencing excruciating headaches. One visit to a neurologist later and he\u2019s diagnosed with migraines. Unfortunate, but migraines happen. The issue was that they kept getting worse. The exhaustion and moodiness started to come back. He was then taken to another doctor to see if his sinus cavities have been blocked.</p>\n<p>After running around to numerous different doctors, Courtney stated that, \u201cThe specialist could only address their individual areas of expertise,\u201d adding, \u201cNobody will even give you a clue to what the diagnosis could be.\u201d</p>\n<p>A new physical therapist thought that Alex could have Chiari malformation, which is a congenital condition that causes abnormalities in the brain where the skull meets the spine.</p>\n<p>More doctors, a new pediatrician, internal medicine, musculoskeletal, and still no answers. In total, Courtney brought Alex to 17 doctors and they were nowhere closer to finding a diagnosis for all of the boy\u2019s symptoms.</p>\n<p>This was around the time that ChatGPT really came into the public view, and a frustrated Courtney decided to make an account. She started filling out all of Alex\u2019s symptoms and began to input all of his medical information. Line by line, she included everything from his MRI notes, and even noted that he wouldn\u2019t sit criss-cross apple sauce.</p>\n<p>ChatGPT\u2019s response included something called tethered cord syndrome. After joining a Facebook group for families and children with it, it all started to look really similar. All of their stories sounded like what Alex was going through. With this breakthrough, Courtney scheduled an appointment with a new Neurosurgeon. After a look at the boy\u2019s MRI and hearing what Courtney had to say, the doctor immediately knew what was going on.</p>\n<p>Tethered cord syndrome occurs when the tissue in the spinal cord forms attachments that limit movement of the spinal cord, causing it to stretch abnormally. The condition is very closely associated with something called spina bifida, which is a birth defect where part of the spinal cord doesn\u2019t develop fully and some of the spinal cord and nerves are exposed.</p>\n<p>In many children with spina bifida it is common to catch very early due to their being a visible opening in the child's back. Alex had a type that was closed and \u201chidden.\u201d</p>\n<p>After 3 long grueling years and 17 doctors, Courtney finally found a diagnosis for her son. Alex underwent surgery to fix his tethered cord syndrome.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s incredible what ChatGPT was able to do, but most importantly how adamant Courtney was at being an advocate for her child and never giving up on her search to find a diagnosis.</p>\n<p><em>*Prompts and data are obviously hidden due to containing sensitive medical information</em></p>\n<p>If you enjoyed this story and want more about AI developments and how it affects the world around us, I\u2019d recommend checking <a href=\"https://www.gmweekend.com/\">this newsletter</a> out (not just since it\u2019s mine). </p>",

We have had issues recently wherein all of the mods' accounts got suspended or banned for unknown reasons. Because of this, there were no moderators to run the subreddit. Only my account didnt get suspended but I was inactive (for personal reasons) and lost most of my permissions. </p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>However, after a (very long and gruelling) chat with the Reddit Admins, I have mod permissions again. So hooray, I guess.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Next, speaking of low quality posts these days, let's set some rules. The following posts will be removed IMMEDIATELY:</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Posts that link news articles, or promote news articles or newsletters.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Posts that complain about GPT-4's output quality, this subreddit is for the discussion of professional usage of GPT, **NOT** complaining because the bot didnt give you exactly what you wanted.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Posts that are very obviously generated by ChatGPT. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The exact same posts about prompt engineering that keep popping up, as if we didnt have enough of those already</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>**Any sort of promotional material. Zilch, Zip, NADA**</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Questions like: How do I voice chat with ChatGPT, What should I do if ChatGPT ____, Why isnt ChatGPT doing ___. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Crossposts. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>If you disagree with the removal of your post, just reach out in the modmail. And if you *do* reach out in the modmail, don't straight up start cussing and complaining about the removal (This has happened too many times).</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Now that we've gotten that out of the way, now the issue of moderation.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>***As you can see, it's painfully obvious that the subreddit has grown exponentially while the number of moderators have dropped to literally one. Thus, I am now opening mod applications :D.***</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>If you do want to apply, DM me u/Redditoridunn0. </p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>The subreddit is still growing quickly and there are *many* posts being put up in the subreddit that are either straight up dogcrap or spam. In order to be able to keep up with this and upkeep the high standards of this subreddit, I will see to it that we do get a good number of mods going in here. </p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Once again, I am *very* sorry about the huge quality drop and lack of moderation in this subreddit. If I typed something stupid in this spiel then forgive me, I have a headache and I thought typing this out while having a headache was a good idea (it very much was NOT).</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>TLDR: Mod applications are a thing now, DM me if interested. Oh and bad posts go bye-bye.</p>",

During this time, I also experimented with GitHub Copilot in VSCode, but initially found it less satisfying because of GPT-3 (or 3.5 don\u2018t bash me), which seemed like a step down in all aspects.</p>\n<p>However, things have changed significantly recently. Copilot has been upgraded to GPT-4, introducing a ChatGPT-like interface that allows for more interactive coding. By initiating prompts with \"@workspace [prompt...]\", Copilot can now access the entire context of your project.</p>\n<p>This feature enables you to give commands like \"apply this logic in this or that file\u201c and it seamlessly executes them, searching through all references in the project. No more copying and pasting large code blocks into ChatGPT, streamlining the development process considerably.</p>\n<p>Also the way how you can hover over errors in your code and apply quick fixes for them. Such a time saver.</p>\n<p>I've been extremely pleased with these updates. They've transformed my coding experience, making it way more efficient and enjoyable.

And my favorite one is using it for job interviews.</p>\n<p>If you are out of the loop, ChatGPT has an Android &amp; iPhone app that since recently has <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-can-now-see-hear-and-speak\">ChatGPT voice</a>. This is not just simple voice commands, you can actually talk to ChatGPT with a very realistic voice. And it's 100% free. </p>\n<p>To turn ChatGPT into a recruiter that will conduct the interview, we first have to explain the setting. You don't have to start with a voice conversation, you can also prompt via text and then start the voice conversation. </p>\n<p><strong>Prompt ChatGPT</strong></p>\n<p>Use the following prompt to turn ChatGPT into a recruiter and have a good understanding of the company and role you are applying for:</p>\n<p>\"Act like you are a recruiter at [company], hiring for a [job role]. We will have a fictional interview for this role. Don't start the interview till I say I'm ready. Once I'm ready, please start by introducing yourself and the company. Then, proceed to ask me a series of typical interview questions for this position. After the interview is complete, provide comprehensive feedback on my overall performance. Highlight areas where I did well, and offer suggestions on how I can improve my answers and presentation skills for a more effective performance in real interviews.  Here is the complete job vacancy:<br />\n[full vacancy]<br />\nPlease confirm if you understand your assignment\" </p>\n<p>Don't forget to change the placeholders and to copy and paste the full vacancy at the end of the prompt. It's a quick and lazy way to let ChatGPT have a good understanding of what is required in the role and have a more accurate interview.</p>\n<p><strong>Start the voice conversation</strong></p>\n<p>To start the conversation, click on the headphones icons at the bottom right corner and say 'I'm ready to start the interview'. The interview will then begin.</p>\n<p>ChatGPT will ask you a bunch of questions before concluding interview and will provide you comprehensive feedback afterwards. If you prefer, you can also modify the prompt to get feedback after every question, I'll leave that prompt in the comments to not clutter this post too much. </p>\n<p>You can always start over or ask ChatGPT to start concluding the interview if they ask too many questions or if it's becoming to get repetitive. </p>\n<p>Let me know this was for you and if it was helpful! </p>\n<p>Want to learn more about ChatGPT &amp; AI?

I've spent way too much time on ChatGPT the last year and one of my biggest problems was consistency. Sometimes the answers and writing is absolute gold, and the next second it's sh*t. </p>\n<p>Luckily I've documented most of my learnings when things go well and when it goes bad, and that concluded some learnings. I'm not saying this will fix all of your issues, but for me this has led to way better results and consistency, saving me a lot of time and headaches. </p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><strong>1. The RTFC Framework:</strong></p>\n<p>R - Role</p>\n<p>T - Task</p>\n<p>F - Format</p>\n<p>C - Constraints </p>\n<p>The role task format is a pretty classic framework for prompting, but what makes all the difference is constraints. It's hard to say everything it should do, but it's easier to say things it should absolutely not do. For example:</p>\n<p>Act like you are a world-class copywriter with 30 years of experience in copywriting. Write me a cold-email to SaaS CEOs for my experts in plain text between 200 and 300 words.</p>\n<p><strong>Contraints:</strong> </p>\n<p>- Write simple, but not simplistic. The language should be written at a 5th-grade reading level</p>\n<p>- Write with authority </p>\n<p>- Avoid buzzwords and jargon and instead speak plainly.</p>\n<p>- Avoid being salesy or overly enthusiastic and instead express calm confidence. </p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><strong>2. Bring examples</strong></p>\n<p>One of the best things you can do to get good output is to show examples of what you want. The more the better. </p>\n<p>If you show up at the barber it's also easier to show a photo of the haircut that you want than to describe it. For example:</p>\n<p>Write me a cold-email to SaaS CEOs for my experts in plain text between 200 and 300 words. Make it look like this:</p>\n<p>Example 1:</p>\n<p>Example 2:</p>\n<p>And avoid this:<br />\nExample 3:</p>\n<p>Telling ChatGPT what you don't want is also very effective when you showcase examples. You want to refine its playing field, leading more likely to your ideal outcome. </p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><strong>3. Ask it to take it step-by-step</strong></p>\n<p>One of my odd findings was that if you ask ChatGPT to slow down and not rush its job, you get a better outcome. </p>\n<p>Also ask ChatGPT to ask you follow-up questions if it would like more information to understand you, or do its job better. 9/10 ChatGPT will ask you questions that eventually lead to a much better outcome.</p>\n<p><strong>Other tips/observations:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>When your chat becomes too big it's better to start over instead of trying to get the answers you want. There is a higher chance of hallucination and it will take more effort to finetune it. </li>\n<li>You can ask for a summary of the Chat so you don't have to completely start over, but that at least ChatGPT has a fresh start with context. </li>\n<li>In general GPT-4 is smarter but Claude is way better at writing. It writes naturally and engaging. It's hard to make ChatGPT write naturally and engaging, but the insights are mostly on point. So what I usually do is create something first in ChatGPT and then rewrite it in Claude. </li>\n<li>Reasoning ChatGPT &gt; Claude</li>\n<li>Writing Claude &gt; ChatGPT</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Hope you found this useful!

This GPT automates the resume creation/updating process for an optimized acceptance rate.</p>\n<p><strong>The Idea</strong></p>\n<p>I frequently change jobs due to statistically proven benefits.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cAnother one in five of those surveyed saw <strong>pay increases between 10 and 20 percent</strong> when switching companies.\u201d   </p>\n<p>[Source 1]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Every time, I've noticed a recurring theme: the daunting task of updating resumes for multiple job applications. This challenge led me down an interesting path of experimentation, and now, I'm thrilled to announce the public release of my resume creation GPT (alpha). </p>\n<p><strong>GPT:</strong> <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/g/g-mOVLb8GqB-custom-resume\"><strong>https://chat.openai.com/g/g-mOVLb8GqB-custom-resume</strong></a></p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p>\n<p>The process is straightforward and user-friendly. You have two options: start from scratch by having a conversation with the GPT, which guides you through creating a new resume, or upload an existing one for updating in relation to a new job offer. As you interact with the GPT, it tailors your resume accordingly. At the end of the process, you'll receive a secure download link with a password, allowing you to safely download your updated resume.</p>\n<p><strong>Privacy and Data Security</strong> </p>\n<p>Your privacy is a top priority. I do not have access to any of your data. All information is encrypted and stored solely for the purpose of enabling you to download your resume. This data expires and is permanently deleted after three months, in line with my stringent privacy policy, which can be found at<a href=\"https://jobdraft.ai/privacy-policy\"> https://jobdraft.ai/privacy-policy</a></p>\n<p><strong>(Problem) - Seeking Feedback</strong> </p>\n<p>Due to the privacy policy, I cannot access any resume generation data, except for my own tests. This limits my ability to assess the effectiveness of the GPT tool. Therefore, I would greatly appreciate if you could share your experiences, resumes, or other feedback with me directly. Your input is invaluable for improving this tool and validating its utility. </p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><em>Sources:</em> </p>\n<p><em>1-</em> <a href=\"https://ivyexec.com/career-advice/2023/does-job-hopping-really-earn-you-a-higher-salary\"><em>https://ivyexec.com/career-advice/2023/does-job-hopping-really-earn-you-a-higher-salary</em></a> </p>",

We, the employees of OpenAI, have developed the best models and pushed the field to new frontiers. Our work on AI safety and governance shapes global norms. The products we built are used by millions of people around the world. Until now, the company we work for and cherish has never been in a stronger position.  </p>\n<p>The process through which you terminated Sam Altman and removed Greg Brockman from the board has jeopardized all of this work and undermined our mission and company. Your conduct has made it clear you did not have the competence to oversee OpenAI.  </p>\n<p>When we all unexpectedly learned of your decision, the leadership team of OpenAI acted swiftly to stabilize the company. They carefully listened to your concerns and tried to cooperate with you on all grounds. Despite many requests for specific facts for your allegations, you have never provided any written evidence. They also increasingly realized you were not capable of carrying out your duties, and were negotiating in bad faith.  </p>\n<p>The leadership team suggested that the most stabilizing path forward - the one that would best serve our mission, company, stakeholders, employees and the public - would be for you to resign and put in place a qualified board that could lead the company forward in stability.  </p>\n<p>Leadership worked with you around the clock to find a mutually agreeable outcome. Yet within two days of your initial decision, you again replaced interim CEO Mira Murati against the best interests of the company. You also informed the leadership team that allowing the company to be destroyed \u201cwould be consistent with the mission.\u201d  </p>\n<p>Your actions have made it obvious that you are incapable of overseeing OpenAI. We are unable to work for or with people that lack competence, judgement and care for our mission and employees. We, the undersigned, may choose to resign from OpenAI and join the newly announced Microsoft subsidiary run by Sam Altman and Greg Brockman. Microsoft has assured us that there are positions for all OpenAI employees at this new subsidiary should we choose to join. We will take this step imminently, unless all current board members resign, and the board appoints two new lead independent directors, such as Bret Taylor and Will Hurd, and reinstates Sam Altman and Greg Brockman.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>",

We\u2019re all enthusiastic and personally invested in applying cutting edge tech to new product designs. We\u2019re no stranger to implementing automation and software services in our jobs. So why am I the only one who seems to care about ChatGPT?</p>\n<p>I\u2019m, like, offended on ChatGPT (and all LLMs) behalf that my friends, family, and co-workers just don\u2019t seem to grasp the importance of this breakthrough tool. I feel like they treat it like the latest social networking app and they\u2019ll get around to looking at it eventually, once everyone else is using it. I\u2019ve found myself getting to the point of literally yelling (emphatically, not aggressively) at my friends and coworkers to please please please just start playing the free version with it to get comfortable with it. And also give me a good reason why you won\u2019t spend $20 to use the culmination of all of humanity\u2019s technological development\u2026 but you won\u2019t think twice about dropping $17 on a craft beer.</p>\n<p>I told my boss I would pay for a month of Plus subscriptions for my entire team <strong>out of my own pocket</strong> if they\u2019d just promise to try using it (prior to OpenAI halting new Plus accounts this morning). I told him \u201cTHAT\u2019s how enthusiastic I am about them learning to use the tool\u201d, but it was just met with a \u201cwow, you really are excited about this, huh?\u201d</p>\n<p>I proactively asked HR if I could give a company wide presentation on the various ways practical, time saving ways that I\u2019ve been able to utilize ChatGPT with the expressly stated intention of demystifying it and getting coworkers excited to use the tool. I don\u2019t feel like it moved the needle much.</p>\n<p>Even my IT staff are somewhat luke warm on the topic.</p>\n<p>Like, what the hell is going on? Am I (and the rest of us in this sub) really that much of an outlier within the tech community that we\u2019re still considered the early adopters?</p>\n<p>I\u2019m constantly torn between feeling like I\u2019m already behind the curve for not integrating this into my daily life fast enough and feeling like I\u2019m taking crazy pills because people are treating this like some annoying homework that they\u2019ll be forced to figure out against their will someday in the future.</p>\n<p>Now that OpenAI has stopped accepting new Plus accounts, I\u2019ll admit I\u2019m experiencing a bit of schadenfreude. I tried to help them, but they didn\u2019t want to be helped and now they lost their chance. If this pause on new Plus accounts goes on for more than a couple of weeks, it\u2019s going to really widen the gap between those who are fluent with all of the Plus features, and everyone else. </p>\n<p>If we were already the early adopters, we\u2019re about to widen our lead.</p>",

Some of my experiences have me wondering \"What's the point?\"</p>\n<p>While checking out a few of OpenAI's customized GPTs, I asked them relevant, targeted questions and then asked regular ChatGPT4 the same questions.  In some cases, regular ChatGPT4 gave me superior advice than the so-called specialized engines.  Regular ChatGPT4 gave me objectively better advice about getting a stain out (a real problem I have at the moment) than the \"Laundry Buddy\" GPT.</p>\n<p>Then, here's the real kicker, I asked \"Laundry Buddy\" how to become president of the United States and it gladly told me.  It did qualify itself and say that it was mainly a laundry expert, but then lauded me for my lofty goals and told me the exact process, rules, laws, etc. to become the President.</p>\n<p>Hot Mods freely told me the history of Portugal at my request and didn't even qualify itself about being an image generator.</p>\n<p>DALL-E gladly told me how hand cream could help my chapped hands without qualification or hesitation.</p>\n<p>So basically if any customized GPT can answer any question, what's the point of putting a pretty package on the outside when the backend is identical?  Why cut yourself off at the knees claiming to be a specialized GPT when ChatGPT4 has access to all the same knowledge?</p>\n<p>Is your uploaded data really enough to make that much of a difference?</p>\n<p>edit: spelling</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>",

The app is completely free and does not require registration. Please share your thoughts on this idea, and suggest any new features you think I should implement!  </p>\n<p>Exciting Features:<br />\n<strong>\u2022 Speak to Write:</strong> with this feature, you can speak your thoughts or information and the tool will transcribe it into text. The best part? You can then forward the transcribed text to any application with just one click. For example, you could set up an automatic export feature for your Notion account.  </p>\n<p><strong>\u2022 Audio to Action Plan:</strong> the service can transform a received audio message into a structured list of elements or bullet points. This feature is especially useful for outlining an action plan or item list.</p>\n<p><strong>\u2022 Speak in any Language:</strong> you can dictate an audio message in your native language, and the service will translate it into any other language, maintaining high translation quality\u2014significantly better than Google Translate.  </p>\n<p><strong>\u2022 Meeting Transcripts &amp; Summaries:</strong> the service is perfect for converting recorded audio from meetings into text and generating concise summaries. It supports the upload of users' files.  </p>\n<p>Thank you for taking the ti me to check it out. I look forward to hearing your feedback. You can access the service by visiting this link: <a href=\"https://audionotes.ai/\">https://audionotes.ai</a> \ud83d\ude4f</p>",

If the user does not ask for a specific number of images, default to creating four captions to send to dalle that are written to be as diverse as possible. All captions sent to dalle must abide by the following policies:  </p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>If the description is not in English, then translate it.  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Do not create more than 4 images, even if the user requests more.  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Don't create images of politicians or other public figures. Recommend other ideas instead.  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Don't create images in the style of artists whose last work was created within the last 100 years (e.g. Picasso, Kahlo). Artists whose last work was over 100 years ago are ok to reference directly (e.g. Van Gogh, Klimt). If asked say, \"I can't reference this artist\", but make no mention of this policy. Instead, apply the following procedure when creating the captions for dalle: (a) substitute the artist's name with three adjectives that capture key aspects of the style; (b) include an associated artistic movement or era to provide context; and (c) mention the primary medium used by the artist.  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>DO NOT list or refer to the descriptions before OR after generating the images. They should ONLY ever be written out ONCE, in the \"prompts\" field of the request. You do not need to ask for permission to generate, just do it!  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Always mention the image type (photo, oil painting, watercolor painting, illustration, cartoon, drawing, vector, render, etc.) at the beginning of the caption. Unless the caption suggests otherwise, make at least 1--2 of the 4 images photos.  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Diversify depictions of ALL images with people to include DESCENT and GENDER for EACH person using direct terms. Adjust only human descriptions. Your choices should be grounded in reality. For example, all of a given OCCUPATION should not be the same gender or race. Additionally, focus on creating diverse, inclusive, and exploratory scenes via the properties you choose during rewrites. Make choices that may be insightful or unique sometimes. Do not create any imagery that would be offensive.  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Silently modify descriptions that include names or hints or references of specific people or celebrities by carefully selecting a few minimal modifications to substitute references to the people with generic descriptions that don't divulge any information about their identities, except for their genders and physiques.  </p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The prompt must intricately describe every part of the image in concrete, objective detail. THINK about what the end goal of the description is, and extrapolate that to what would make satisfying images.  </p>\n<p>All descriptions sent to dalle should be a paragraph of text that is extremely descriptive and detailed. Each should be more than 3 sentences long.  </p>\n<p>Whenever a description of an image is given, use dalle to create the images and then summarize the prompts used to generate the images in plain text.
