Since we recommend players using another account for their modded games, it\u2019s nice to support doing that a little better.</li>\n<li>To prevent event games running past the final cutoff on score submission time for ranked events, there will now be a short break in the final moments of competitive events in which the event is still active but no further games can be started. <em>*Note this will only be in place for ranked events, meaning that Boss events will allow you to create games still so long as you swap back to non-ranked mode</em></li>\n<li><em>Example: there is a 24h event, with a 1hour cutoff (the cutoff can be set to any value, bosses will have a longer one but races wont need so much)</em></li>\n<li><em>When the event first starts it will display 23h remaining not 24</em></li>\n<li><em>After those 23 hours once the timer ends it begins a new timer with 1h remaining</em></li>\n<li><em>During this final hour you cannot start a new game or continue an existing game on ranked mode, but you can finish off one that is already started and open</em></li>\n<li><em>If you quit out of a run that has already started, that's it, you will not be able to enter the play menu to load that save again.</em></li>\n<li><em>In the case of bosses, you can swap back to non-ranked mode and create as many games as you want as normal during this final hour to finish off your milestones if you have not done them</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Bug Fixes &amp;

If you have more than one hero this will cycle through them</li>\n<li>Resolved an issue with using hotkeys during loading screens causing some tower portraits to become faded out</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Balance Changes</h1>\n<p>Dart Monkey</p>\n<p>To add a little more synergetic crosspath use for the Juggernaut 402 crosspath, xx2 will now also grant bonus projectile lifespan, this applies to any use of that crosspath though we feel it will in particular pair nicely with the ricocheting projectiles. Juggernaut in general is also seeing a small utility knockback buff to help it carry on a little longer into the game.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>xx1 Long Range Darts also increases projectile lifespan +15%</li>\n<li>xx2 Enhanced Eyesight also increases projectile lifespan +20%</li>\n<li>4xx Juggernaut gains a slight Bloon knockback (Same as xx3 dartling, but half duration)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Bomb Shooter</p>\n<p>The Frags crosspath for top path Bomb Shooter has always been quite a poor choice, trying to compete with attack speed as a benefit for stun utility isn\u2019t going to ever work out so we have instead gone the route of turning the frags crosspath into a DPS/Stun hybrid with a lot of small buffs to frag power.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>302 Really Big Bombs frag damage increased 1 -&gt; 3</li>\n<li>302 Really Big Bombs gains more frags 8 -&gt; 12</li>\n<li>402 Bloon Impact frag pierce increased +1</li>\n<li>402 Bloon Impact frag damage increased 2 -&gt; 3</li>\n<li>402 Bloon Impact gains even more frags 8 -&gt; 16</li>\n<li>502 Bloon Crush remains at frag damage 12</li>\n<li>502 Bloon Crush frags gain bonus to ceramic +12</li>\n<li>502 Bloon Crush gains frag pierce 3 -&gt; 20</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Glue Gunner</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2xx Corrosive Glue DoT rate increased 2.3s -&gt; 2</li>\n<li>3xx Bloon Dissolver DoT ceramic bonus increased 0 -&gt; 1</li>\n<li>4xx Bloon Liquifier DoT ceramic bonus unchanged</li>\n<li>5xx The Bloon Solver bonus moab damage increased 3 -&gt; 5</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Monkey Sub</p>\n<p>Energizer upgrade offers nothing extra to the reactor sub aside from niche utility buffs, so we have increased the lategame cleanup potential by a large amount to help deal with Super Ceramics.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>5xx Energizer damage increased 3 -&gt; 5</li>\n<li>5xx Energizer now adds bonus damage to ceramics +5</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Monkey Buccaneer</p>\n<p>The base Grape attack of T4 MOAB Takedown has had a ceramic bonus added to lead up to the T5 a little better.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>x4x MOAB Takedown grapeshot ceramic bonus added +1</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Monkey Ace</p>\n<p>Spy Plane is always a lesser crosspath aside from specific challenges that call for camo detection. It has a similar vibe to Night Vision sniper so we have given it a similar buff.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>x2x Spy Plane grants attacks bonus damage to camos +1</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Heli Pilot</p>\n<p>Previously Razor Rotor\u2019s used to make the heli pursue for a further distance &amp; this caused it to often fail to reach Lead Bloons with the rotor attack that could pop them. This overall seemed like a design flaw so that back-off distance has been moved up to the T4 instead. Apache Dartship has also fallen off over time as a viable saveup for prime, though it is meant to be reasonably difficult some changes have made this a little more difficult than it probably should be so we have increased the pierce of the machinegun attack.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>3xx Razor Rotor\u2019s pursuit no longer backs so far away from Leads that it can\u2019t hit them</li>\n<li>4xx Apache Dartship pursuit distance increase now occurs here</li>\n<li>4xx Apache Dartship Machinegun pierce increased 5 -&gt; 7</li>\n<li>5xx Apache Prime Machinegun pierce unchanged</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Dartling Gunner</p>\n<p>Ray of Doom suffers from the downsides of being designed as a high piercing tower, for the price this makes it feel far too weak against the round 100 BAD if you invest in it too early without some other forms of single target, to bring back a little of the interesting sort of targeting that the T4 has and help with this single target problem it will now deal a massive damage bonus to the first target hit along the beam\u2019s path.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>5xx Ray of Doom now deals bonus damage to the first target hit +55</li>\n<li>3xx Laser Cannon pierce increased from 4 -&gt; 6</li>\n<li>302 Laser Cannon pierce increased from 6 -&gt; 9</li>\n<li>xx2 Powerful Darts now also gives 'larger projectiles' as a crosspath</li>\n<li>002 Powerful Darts normal projectile size increased from 2 -&gt; 3</li>\n<li>032 Hydra Rocket Pods explosion size increased from 8 -&gt; 12</li>\n<li>402 Plasma Accelerator focal point size increased from 4 -&gt; 6</li>\n<li>402 Plasma Accelerator beam width increased from 2 -&gt; 3</li>\n<li>502 Ray of Doom beam width increased from 6 -&gt; 9</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Wizard Monkey</p>\n<p>Arcane Blast's benefit to the base tower is quite small for the price and also doesn't carry on well as a crosspath to the other T3s since they add new attacks instead of buffing the base attack, the price has been reduced to add a little more value here along with more MOAB damage at the T5 to give it a little more value over Arcane Spikes. As we somewhat expected the last Prince of Darkness rework didn\u2019t end up really nerfing it so much, so we are now following up with a small price nerf.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2xx Arcane Blast price reduced $600 -&gt; $450</li>\n<li>5xx Archmage bonus damage to MOABs 17 -&gt; 19</li>\n<li>xx5 Prince of Darkness price increased from $24,000 -&gt; 26,500</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Super Monkey</p>\n<p>Robo didn't need to lose pierce in the last Super Monkey T2 rework, and Dark Knight feels like it has too much pierce without ever considering the pierce crosspath. So to balance these together we\u2019ve taken out pierce from Dark Knight and added it back into x2x carrying up into Robo Monkey. Dark Champion pierce is increased rather than decreased to push it further ahead of Dark Knight.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>x2x Epic Range increases pierce further 3 -&gt; 4</li>\n<li>xx3 Dark Knight pierce decreased 5 -&gt; 4</li>\n<li>xx4 Dark Champion pierce increased 7 -&gt; 8</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ninja Monkey</p>\n<p>Grand Sabotage is extremely powerful in freeplay, but really boring outside of that one scaling mechanic. For a little more flavour with the shinobi mechanic, the T5 will now boost the potential of your shinobi army.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>x5x Grand Sabotage ability grants all your Shinobi on screen +5 range</li>\n<li>x5x Grand Sabotage ability grants all Shinobi +1 damage to MOABs</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Banana Farm</p>\n<p>Partially to help a little with tedious endgame farm collection in ranked boss events, or any other use you may desire for it, we have added a non-power form of easy banana collection. However  we do not want to trivialize the intended downside of opting for a more micro intensive farm path too much, so this is still restricted behind a low-range tier 5 upgrade.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>xx5 Monkey Wall Street now collects nearby bananas/crates as a Monkey Farmer would</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Spike Factory</p>\n<p>To help make the tradeoff of building one T5 over multiple T4 not be as hard a choice, the basic attack on Carpet of Spikes has had power increased significantly over rate, range &amp; damage.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>x5x Carpet of Spikes range increased from 34 -&gt; 50</li>\n<li>x5x Carpet of Spikes main damage increased from 3 -&gt; 4</li>\n<li>x5x Carpet of Spikes main attack delay reduced 0.98s -&gt; 0.33</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Monkey Village</p>\n<p>Call to Arms ability suffers from uptime, for such an expensive upgrade which is such low range and purely support this makes it hard to use, so duration has now been increased to push it up to a 1/3rd uptime threshold</p>\n<ul>\n<li>x4x Call To Arms ability duration increased 12 -&gt; 15</li>\n<li>x5x Homeland duration remains unchanged</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Engineer</p>\n<p>Sentry Expert really needed some logic fixes to get more of the actual correct sentries placed at the right times, it has also received a number of power buffs across the board to the special sentries at T4 complimenting the new logic reworking. Cleansing Foam has had some extra crosspath utility added at the cost of a small price increase and a large decrease to Ultraboost price.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>4xx Sentry Expert logic has been reworked to evaluate threat levels based on Bloon types that it can counter, Bloon types that counter the sentries that it wants to spawn, and which of the current threats on screen is the greatest. Distribution of sentry types should scale based on how much one Bloon threat is more of a threat than another.</li>\n<li>4xx Sentry Expert Crush Sentry ceramic damage bonus increased from 1 -&gt; 4</li>\n<li>4xx Sentry Expert Crush Sentry damage type changed from Sharp -&gt; Shatter</li>\n<li>4xx Sentry Expert Bomb Sentry damage increased 2 -&gt; 4</li>\n<li>4xx Sentry Expert Cold Sentry pierce increased from 15 -&gt; 25</li>\n<li>4xx Sentry Expert Cold Sentry radius increased from 12 -&gt; 18</li>\n<li>4xx Sentry Expert Energy Sentry gain moab damage bonus of +2</li>\n<li>x3x Cleansing Foam price increased from 800 -&gt; 850</li>\n<li>032 Pin allows Cleansing Foam to slow Bloons 50% briefly</li>\n<li>130 Foam makes Sentries shoot Foamy nails that strip properties</li>\n<li>x5x Ultraboost price decreased from $120,000 -&gt; 105,000</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Gwendolin</p>\n<p>Gwendolin\u2019s Firestorm damage doesn\u2019t carry well into the endgame so has been buffed at a later level.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lv16 Firestorm base damage tic increases from 1 &gt; 5</li>\n<li>Lv16 Firestorm MOAB damage tic increases from 10 &gt; 15</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Pat Fusty</p>\n<p>Pat Fusty was initially given a smaller footprint than it felt he should have due to concerns about balance with his small radius, but actually has been extremely powerful for a long time despite these radius issues. We feel like now giving him back the footprint size that he always should have had similar to Churchill will add a reasonable lategame downside to consider without harming his early use so badly.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pat Fusty footprint increased from 7 -&gt; 8</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Admiral Brickell</p>\n<p>The Sea Mines delay that was added back in 29 has done well for reducing some of Brickells weaknesses, but as we expected somewhat does add in new weaknesses to rush rounds of Bloons that can now sneak past before all of her mines have been able to acquire a target. To help lessen this new issue she has gained a brand new ability that will allow more Sea Mines to rapidly deploy and find a target over a short duration.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lv7 Blast Chain utility ability added for Admiral Brickell. For 10 seconds all sea mines have their delay halved (the new one added in 29), &amp; their projectile speed doubled</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Psi</p>\n<p>We felt that Psi\u2019s early game too easily carried into some extremely powerful endgame setups. These setups were overperforming due to certain cooldown interactions with stalling out cooldown, however in an effort to try to avoid nerfing the cooldown for the average player we decided to make that stalling synergy harder to pull off instead.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Psi base price increased $800 -&gt; 1000</li>\n<li>Lv10 Psionic Scream ability 'speed of blow back' increased from bloon speed 300% -&gt; 600%</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Glue Rat</p>\n<p>Glue Rat pet has been overperforming in all game modes for a while now without any apparent weakness or strategic downsides.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Base movement speed ramping level endures persistently</li>\n<li>Max level goggle tightness loosened from Max -&gt; Sam</li>\n</ul></div>",
