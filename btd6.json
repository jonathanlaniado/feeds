5%</li>\n<li>Round 121+ natural income generation remains at 2%</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Dart Monkey</p>\n<p>As Sharpshooter\u2019s crit occurrence didn\u2019t feel frequent enough the overall attack rate has been increased also just to lead better into the T5\u2019s already high rate of fire. Along with this all Crossbow criticals have been standardized, overall with T5 criticals occurring more frequently in exchange for a slight reduction in base pierce to improve Sharp Shot crosspath value. Apex Plasma Master excels generally for the cheapest paragon &amp; how easy it is to start scaling early degrees so is seeing a rate decrease.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>xx4 Sharpshooter attack cooldown reduced from 0.75 &gt; 0.6</li>\n<li>xx5 Crossbow Master attack cooldown unchanged</li>\n<li>xx4 Sharpshooter crit rate changed from 8-12 shots to every 10th</li>\n<li>xx5 Crossbow Master crit rate changed from 4-8 shots to every 5th</li>\n<li>xx5 Crossbow Master pierce reduced from 10 &gt; 8</li>\n<li>Apex Plasma Master attack cooldown increased from 0.3 &gt; 0.35</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Tack Shooter</p>\n<p>The Tack Zone\u2019s all-purpose high single target &amp; grouped DPS plus cleanup utility scales too well with so many options, as this is primarily intended to be the single-target damage path. To reinforce this we have traded off damage for a bonus to MOABs in order to nerf its unbuffed cleanup potential, so watch out for cluster and Super Ceramics now. Ring of Fire should pick up in that area for cleanup use &amp; general destruction but it has more pierce than it really needs in most scenarios with other important stats sitting lower to compensate for high pierce, so we have shifted this high pierce more into requiring the pierce crosspath in exchange for more base power and an overall buff. Inferno Ring\u2019s meteor will now also follow target priority since that was a fun idea that was worth adding.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>xx5 Tack Zone damage reduced from 2 &gt; 1</li>\n<li>xx5 Tack Zone gains bonus damage to MOABs +1</li>\n<li>4xx Ring of Fire attack cooldown reduced 0.4725 &gt; 0.315 (buff of +25 &gt; 50%)</li>\n<li>4xx Ring of Fire pierce reduced from 60 &gt; 40</li>\n<li>4xx Ring of Fire damage increased from 3 &gt; 5</li>\n<li>5xx Inferno Ring damage increased from 4 &gt; 8</li>\n<li>5xx Inferno Ring MOAB bonus reduced from 6 &gt; 4</li>\n<li>5xx Inferno Ring attack speed unchanged</li>\n<li>5xx Inferno Ring Meteor now follows Target Priority</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ice Monkey</p>\n<p>Arctic Wind hardly gets used for its actual basic intended purpose, which would be cool to see used for more than just causing ice platform bug reports.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Arctic Wind aura slow amount increased from 40 &gt; 60%</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Glue Gunner</p>\n<p>We want to achieve an effect with Bloon Solver\u2019s acid burning through the layers quickly but not instantly, though we haven\u2019t so far achieved a good balance of this along with eliminating Super Ceramics in a timely manner, causing it to be disappointing or impractical on shorter maps. To solve this while retaining the vision we have boosted the ceramic bonus up significantly along with preventing this bonus from overflowing into the children layers.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>5xx Bloon Solver DoT's Ceramic bonus damage increased from 2 -&gt; 8</li>\n<li>5xx Bloon Solver DoT\u2019s increased Ceramic damage will not skip through extra children layers upon breaking the ceramic layer</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sniper Monkey</p>\n<p>After the lower tier nerfs Elite Sniper still remains just a bit too good even without considering its cash production.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>x5x Elite Sniper price increased from $13,000 &gt; 14,500</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Monkey Buccaneer</p>\n<p>Monkey Pirates is great for the first couple MOABs but with the long ability cooldown it very quickly falls off after that point, we have pushed it and Pirate Lord\u2019s base stats up to feel more competitive especially with possible Brickell synergy. Trade Empire farming power even with the water requirement feels like it takes off too easily, so the bonus cash it provides will now require T4 Favored Trades for the full benefit.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>x4x Monkey Pirates Grapes damage increased 1 &gt; 2</li>\n<li>x4x Monkey Pirates Grapes ceramic bonus increased 1 &gt; 2</li>\n<li>x4x Monkey Pirates Cannonball explosion damage increased 2 &gt; 3</li>\n<li>x4x Monkey Pirates Cannonball explosion moab bonus increased 0 &gt; 6</li>\n<li>x4x Monkey Pirates price increased $4500 &gt; 4900</li>\n<li>x5x Pirate Lord Grapes damage increased 5 &gt; 10</li>\n<li>x5x Pirate Lord Grapes ceramic bonus increased 5 &gt; 10</li>\n<li>x5x Pirate Lord Grapes burn damage increased 1 -&gt; 9</li>\n<li>x5x Pirate Lord Cannonball explosion damage increased 2 -&gt; 5</li>\n<li>x5x Pirate Lord Cannonball explosion moab bonus increased 0 -&gt; 10</li>\n<li>x5x Pirate Lord Cannonball frags damage increased 1 -&gt; 10</li>\n<li>x5x Pirate Lord Cannonball frags moab bonus increased 0 -&gt; 5</li>\n<li>xx5 Trade Empire cash per round per merchant when applied to xx3 Merchantmen reduced $20 -&gt; $15</li>\n<li>xx5 Trade Empire cash per round per merchant when applied to xx4 Favored Trades remains at $20</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Monkey Ace</p>\n<p>To help you work towards the new Ace Paragon we have reduced Spectre\u2019s lategame ceramic weakness with improved targeting for the bomb projectiles &amp; a large increase to their bonus Ceramic damage to help out later on, to change focus on these projectiles we have also shifted damage around for the darts to deal single target with the bombs providing ceramic AoE cleanup. Flying Fortress\u2019s value drops off by the lategame when you can realistically afford it, so following on with this dart single target focus change at T4 we have added a large MOAB damage bonus to Flying Fortress darts.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>xx4 Spectre darts &amp; bombs now both have a weaker homing effect</li>\n<li>xx4 Spectre dart damage increased from 2 &gt; 3</li>\n<li>xx4 Spectre bomb damage reduced from 3 &gt; 2</li>\n<li>xx4 Spectre bomb ceramic bonus increased from 2 &gt; 4</li>\n<li>xx5 Flying Fortress darts now deal bonus damage to MOABs +10</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Heli Pilot</p>\n<p>Heli\u2019s Razor Rotors don\u2019t scale with higher tiers so improvements have been made specifically to that attack for Dartship &amp; Apache Prime. Support Chinook use is too niche outside of farming for the high cost, so the upgrade cost along with that effective cash gain amount from ability usage has been lowered to retain the same farming while improving niche use. Downdraft has more general use throughout the game and scales better than the more expensive MOAB Shove upgrade though they both see use, so the price of these upgrades has been swapped around. Faster Darts xx1 upgrade will now increase the attack distance of Heli Dart attacks in order to assist with cluttering issues where large numbers of Helis will push each other away from nearby targets.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>4xx Apache Dartship rotors damage increased 2 &gt; 4</li>\n<li>4xx Apache Dartship rotors pierce increased 10 -&gt; 20</li>\n<li>5xx Apache Prime rotors damage increased 2 &gt; 8</li>\n<li>5xx Apache Prime rotors pierce increased 10 -&gt; 40</li>\n<li>x4x Support Chinook price reduced 12,000 -&gt; 10,500</li>\n<li>x4x Support Chinook crate cash reduced $1800 -&gt; 1650</li>\n<li>x3x Downdraft price increased 3000 -&gt; 3500</li>\n<li>xx3 MOAB Shove price reduced 3500 -&gt; 3000</li>\n<li>xx1 Faster Darts also increases attack distance of dart attacks by +30%</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Mortar Monkey</p>\n<p>It has been hard for The Bloon Solver &amp; The Biggest One to exist so close in the same price range when they fill the same role but with The Biggest One being simply better and more versatile, so we have ramped The Biggest One to fill a better role but for a higher cost. Artillery Battery\u2019s special stun bonus is completely ineffective against targets which are impossible to stun, so it is receiving a small damage bonus to these targets to compensate. Other similarly priced decamo options are able to decamo DDTs, so Signal Flare feels like a far lesser choice here having this basic decamo utility locked behind Monkey Knowledge, so that\u2019s being freed up.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>4xx The Big One shockwave gains bonus to ceramic +1</li>\n<li>5xx The Biggest One price increased from $28,000 -&gt; $36,000</li>\n<li>5xx The Biggest One can now stun MOAB Class Bloons at a reduced rate</li>\n<li>MOAB 0.3s, BFB/DDT 0.2s, ZOMG 0.1s</li>\n<li>x4x Artillery Battery deals bonus dmg to BADs &amp; Bosses targets &gt; 4</li>\n<li>x5x Pop &amp; Awe deals bonus dmg to BADs &amp; Bosses targets &gt; 10</li>\n<li>x5x Pop &amp; Awe grants all other x4x mortars bonus dmg to BADs &amp; Bosses &gt; 6</li>\n<li>xx3 Signal Flare can now decamo DDTs</li>\n<li>Paint Stripper MK now instead allows xx4 Shattering Shells to remove Fortification from DDT's</li>\n<li>xx4 Shattering Shells DoT damage per tic increased 1 &gt; 5</li>\n<li>xx5 Blooncineration DoT damage per tic remains at 5</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Dartling Gunner</p>\n<p>Rocket Storm being cheaper than its T3 when the T3 is more of a decent stepping stone into the good T4 didn\u2019t quite sit right, so these prices have just been swapped. Buckshot pierce has been increased to help make its attacks cut through more for a chunkier hit. Focused Firing\u2019s distance bonus on 203 due to how it is setup with projectile speed dropoff was a bit less than this written \u201825%\u2019 realistically closer to 18.75%, so this number has been increased enough to give it roughly a true 30% increase in distance.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>x3x Hydra Rockets price reduced from $5250 &gt; 5100</li>\n<li>x4x Rocket Storm price increased from $5100 &gt; 5250</li>\n<li>xx3 Buckshot dartling pierce increased 4 -&gt; 6</li>\n<li>xx5 Bloon Exclusion Zone pierce remains at 6</li>\n<li>203 Focused Firing distance bonus 25% &gt; 40%</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Wizard Monkey</p>\n<p>Wall of Fire\u2019s exceptional T2 power needs to be moved around for improved crosspathing, along with a slight nerf to Phoenix as it is currently performing too well, and both of these upgrades are shifting some of their power into Dragon\u2019s Breath so it can stand out as more than just a buff to WoF &amp; a stepping stone to Phoenix. Shimmer is prone to missing a lot of camo Bloons due to the low attack rate, we do want it to be slower than other decamos to account for the larger radius and better T5 so we are making the radius benefit more noticable and lowering price</p>\n<ul>\n<li>020 Wall of Fire pierce per tic reduced from 15 -&gt; 10</li>\n<li>021 Wall of Fire pierce per tic reduced from 19 -&gt; 15</li>\n<li>020 Wall of Fire damage Tic rate reduced 0.1 -&gt; 0.15</li>\n<li>020 Wall of Fire wall spawn rate reduced 5.5 -&gt; 6.5</li>\n<li>120 Wall of Fire duration increased 4.5 -&gt; 5.5</li>\n<li>120 Wall of Fire no longer auto-targets but gains a target marker (like x3x Engineer)</li>\n<li>030 Dragon's Breath base damage increased 1 &gt; 2</li>\n<li>030 Dragon's Breath WoF damage Tic rate remains 0.1</li>\n<li>030 Dragon's Breath WoF pierce per tic increased 15 -&gt; 20</li>\n<li>x4x Summon Phoenix price increased $4000 -&gt; 4500</li>\n<li>x4x Summon Phoenix pierce reduced 10 &gt; 8</li>\n<li>xx3 Shimmer radius increased 70 &gt; 80</li>\n<li>xx3 Shimmer price reduced $1700 &gt; 1500</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Super Monkey</p>\n<p>Ultravision is a lackluster crosspath with so many other ways to get camo detection cheaper &amp;/or for more towers. The Anti-Bloon is expensive but as a quite underused tower feels it doesn\u2019t live up to the super monkey name for that cost, for now the ability is seeing a cooldown decrease. We feel Legend of the Night\u2019s base tower is more usable now after recent buffs, so without a total need to lean entirely on the passive ability for use we are increasing this cooldown to prevent some issues.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>x5x The Anti Bloon ability cooldown reduced 45 -&gt; 30s</li>\n<li>xx2 Ultravision grants bonus damage to camo bloons +1</li>\n<li>xx5 Legend of the Night cooldown increased 120 &gt; 180s</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ninja Monkey</p>\n<p>Sticky Bomb feels like it is in a very strong point right now in a lot of situations, though flash bomb isn\u2019t good enough without a great deal of support leading into it, this shift should open up for challenge viability especially in Alternate Bloon Rounds games.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>xx3 Flash Bomb price reduced $2750 &gt; 2250</li>\n<li>xx4 Sticky Bomb price increased $4500 &gt; 5000</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Alchemist</p>\n<p>Transforming Tonic has always had a large struggle with pierce, rather than directly throwing onto the base pierce we have added crosspathing pierce &amp; rate benefits for transformation enjoyers to now choose between.

The goal is to allow stat and visual changes to existing towers for even more fun and flexibility with visuals, memes, and Content Browser submissions</li>\n<li>Map Editor: Not sure if we can pull off both Mods and Map Editor in 2023 but we will go for it. In game tools to create and submit maps will be a huge avenue for community creativity that we want to open up!</li>\n<li>Bosses, Paragons, Towers, and Maps: Even with big features planned we will not forget about the core game and will continue to bring out fun and challenging new gameplay all year.</li>\n<li>Teams+: Contested Territories is just the beginning of what we can do together as Teams, so look for more ways to play with Friends, even as we continue to be dedicated to awesome single-player, offline gameplay as always</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Disclaimer: Not official patch notes, and I don't have insider information :(</p></div>",

We will also share a roadmap soo for other CT changes planned for future updates.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>CT Event #2 will run for 7 days - everyone agreed the first one was too long, so we will now try 7 days on, 7 days off and be open to future duration tweaks</li>\n<li>Degradation back to neutral timer increased from 24 to 28 hours - coming back the next day at a similar time and seeing your owned tiles neutral if not captured was disheartening. We increased to 28 hours so there is a window of overlap that will not throw off point balance too much. We want to make small, iterative changes here as there are many balance consequences.</li>\n<li>Degradation curve changed to maintain the challenge of beating the new best score for longer - tiles will now not degrade at all for 4 hours, then degrade more slowly from there and not reach such high values at the end of the curve</li>\n<li>Team creation cost will be increased significantly - we elected to have generous Team creation with the low 200MM cost and that helped generate a lot of Teams, but many players seemed to create Teams and join an instance only to not participate. By increasing this cost to 2000MM we are making Team creation a more considered decision, which we hope will direct more casually interested players to join already created public Teams</li>\n<li>Added 3 buckets of matchmaking to pool teams together with others of similar activity - we\u2019re not giving much detail here intentionally, as it is complex and iterative but the intent is to connect similarly motivated Teams together</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Additions</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Added CT event prop to main menu to indicate live events</li>\n<li>Added more detail to tile capture messages in the team feed</li>\n<li>Added visual feedback for Master Builder\u2019s self boosting effect</li>\n<li>Added popup for unlocking Team Flair items</li>\n<li>Added hover info to \u2018kick pending\u2019 in teams</li>\n<li>Added a \u201cscore eco\u201d stat to local Teams score UI, which displays the current expected score increase when scores are added to the leaderboards - intended to clarify the relative rate of earning for each Team and inform tactical decisions about which tiles and ownerships to go after</li>\n<li>Added player Online status settings for friends &amp; teams, with Invisibility settings for privacy</li>\n<li>Added player restrictions preventing team hopping during active CT events</li>\n<li>Added pages to Friend\u2019s Teams tab for better organization</li>\n<li>CT Tile Victory will no longer display rewards that you didn\u2019t earn (CT Points/Relics) if you beat the map but did not beat the capture score</li>\n<li>Technical integration of Nexus.gg to enable curator codes - we will share more information about this separately when sign-up pages are ready</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Fixes</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Purchasing Hero Booster from the upgrades page now refreshes the UI correctly to display the new level</li>\n<li>042 Dartling Gunner no longer loses lead popping on the ability</li>\n<li>Resolved an issue where the save state of ultraboost stacks would be forgotten after creating Master Builder</li>\n<li>Resolved an issue where camo trap could miss DDTs if another Bloon passed over it at the same time</li>\n<li>Resolved an issue where selling an IMF Loan at the same time and taking a loan would not immediately try to pay back the loan with that tower\u2019s sellback</li>\n<li>Resolved Bloon Traps re-placing within the map terrain after reloading a save</li>\n<li>Resolved xx2 Spike Factory buff applying to other towers &amp; allowing extra buffs to be applied</li>\n<li>Some Master Builder Sentries will no longer see but fail to hit Camos</li>\n<li>Resolved a crash that could occur with xx4 Necromancer</li>\n<li>Royal Treatment relic now allows Psi to target Purple Bloons</li>\n<li>Bigger Bloons Sabotage no longer also applies to Boss Bloons</li>\n<li>Relic related Life/Shield regeneration functions should no longer interfere with Mana Shield</li>\n<li>Resolved a crash related to restarts in Monkey Teams</li>\n<li>Fixed some UI softlock scenarios</li>\n<li>Local co-op lobby once again shows cosmetics of the lobby host</li>\n<li>Team Vice Mayors can have leadership transferred to them without having to first be demoted again</li>\n<li>Resolved some CT messages not displaying through into Team Feed</li>\n<li>Resolved an error that could occur removing team members</li>\n<li>Resolved some incorrect localizations with Teams &amp; CT</li>\n<li>Resolved a common crash on the CT Base Island menu</li>\n<li>Resolved a crash that could occur when returning to main menu from a race defeat</li>\n<li>Resolved a crash that could occur when leaving menu after joining a guild</li>\n<li>Resolved issues with ghost notifications in the team inventory tab</li>\n<li>Resolved Team Join button sometimes failing to work &amp; a few other Team Join related issues</li>\n<li>Resolved a crash that could occur logging out on Android devices</li>\n<li>Resolved an issue introduced in 32.1 that would cause some players to see an empty \u2018global teams\u2019 field in their CT rewards</li>\n</ul></div>",

Please restart your storefront or be patient if it does not appear for you, these updates can take some time to be rolled out to every region due to how the storefronts are set up.</p>\n<h1>Key New Features</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Massive new Event system - Contested Territories!</li>\n<li>We set out to make this big, inspired by Bloons Monkey City\u2019s instanced six player, single challenge framework but pushing it to be truly next level for BTD6. Big was an understatement - we\u2019ve made a whole new game inside the game!</li>\n<li>Now with 90 players per instance across six player-selected Teams (see below), Contested Territories combines a massive map of 150+ unique PvE challenge-based tiles with the PvP competition of vying for the best score</li>\n<li>With a range of difficulties that increase across Regular, Relic, and Banner tiles, the intent is to allow all player levels and styles to participate. Less experienced players can concentrate on Regular tiles, while more competitive players can duke it out over Relic and Banner tiles. Regular tiles give balanced rewards, Relic tiles give more Team Trophies and Relic Knowledge, and Banner tiles give the most points for the competitive leaderboards.</li>\n<li>More details available on our preview reddit post below, as well as the in-event info button: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/btd6/comments/va7jwc/contested_territory_overview_sneak_peek/\">Link</a></li>\n<li>We\u2019ve spent extra time polishing and balancing this huge new system, so thank you for your patience! As always: feedback welcome on reddit and Discord.</li>\n<li>All new player-selected Teams feature!</li>\n<li>To support Contested Territories and other future features, we\u2019ve added a guilds/clans system called Teams</li>\n<li>Up to 15 players can join together, manage membership, set tactical targets, unlock CT-specific boosts, and unlock a range of cosmetic items to customize your Team</li>\n<li>Closely linked with the Friends system to make it easier to invite or join up with in-game Friends</li>\n<li>Earn Team Trophies from Contested Territory to spice up your Player Teams with cosmetics including Team Banners, Icons &amp; Frames to decorate your team page plus all sorts of 3D items to customize your Team Base Tile</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>New Awesome</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>New Paragon tower, the Engineer Master Builder</li>\n<li>Yes, your Sentry Paragon is back! We ultimately chose Master Builder for the name as it represents the range of abilities better and relates more closely to the awesome construction exo suit that the art team had fun designing</li>\n<li>Deploying 3 powerful activated sentry types that explode on sell and deploy their own sub sentries, the Master Builder maintains its own powerful nail attack that overclocks itself every round</li>\n<li>Pushing for higher Paragon degrees improves nail gun attacks, activated sentry attacks, and activated sentry explosions on sell</li>\n<li>Master Builder is very expensive, almost as much as the Ascended Shadow, so farm hard and check the nets if you want methods to practice, like Hbomb\u2019s here: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TU5LH-tZiRQ\">The Fastest Way To Farm</a> <br />\nOr Ethan Reid\u2019s farming comparison here: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SAIPAl5LGQ\">This is the Best Banana Farm in BTD6!

Quarry\u2019s zig zag path may look long, but the Bloons move faster on those downslope water channels.

Current enabled Monkey Knowledge for a save game will now be locked upon creation of that game</li>\n<li>Behind the scenes refactoring to Hero Skin Data to improve load time &amp; memory</li>\n<li>Changes to Boss auto-play behavior, if a Boss or its spawn are on screen the game &amp; next round always starts immediately. If a Boss is not on screen then the game does not start automatically, play button is shown, &amp; if you have auto-start toggled off then the game will stop between rounds.</li>\n<li>Added a new checkpoint at round 20 for boss events</li>\n<li>Restart functionality added to the pause menu in Race modes</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Bug Fixes &amp;

2400</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Bomb Shooter</p>\n<p>Has been a standout tier 3 for long enough, T4 remaining unchanged to still encourage more focussed use over low tier spam.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>x3x MOAB Mauler bonus MOAB damage 18 -&gt;

Permafrost was previously reduced to a lower price than we\u2019d like to try increase desirability of this crosspath, but as the reworks to metal freeze have had more success there in pulling this path ahead we want to add a little back on here.

We did a looking forward message in Update 30 where we announced work on new Bosses and Paragons, Contested Territories, and an in-game Mods system. We\u2019ll continue that effort to keep the player community updated on our plans at least a couple times a year, and since Contested Territories has been such a huge feature to complete it\u2019s now that time!</p>\n<p>We\u2019ll keep this caveat in place each time. Unless otherwise noted, what we discuss in this section are plans, and we need to be able to make adjustments to these, as we\u2019ve had to this year based on how much time and effort we put into the Geraldo Hero and Contested Territories. We\u2019ll do our best to give context when we make changes, and as always we appreciate your patience, understanding, and support!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Game Size and Value:</li>\n<li>We celebrated BTD6\u2019s 4th anniversary this past June, and we took a look back on the volumes of work that we\u2019ve added to the game since launch.</li>\n<li>INFOGRAPHIC HERE</li>\n<li>By any and all means of comparison, BTD6 is far bigger and stronger than it was 4 years ago, and all that time we have not changed (outside of currency exchange rates applied by storefronts) purchase price, IAP prices, or introduced any paid DLC. Recently when we compared the current size and value of BTD6 with other games, we concluded that we were underpriced.</li>\n<li>While we do not intend to add paid DLC or change IAP prices, we have decided to raise the purchase price by US$2 on mobile platforms and US$4 on desktop platforms. We feel this change is the best way to reflect the current value of the game while still respecting the past purchases of all existing owners of the game by not changing pricing for them.</li>\n<li>We plan to make these price changes on August 18th, two weeks following this update, so that any of your friends and family or wishlist holders still have time to get the game at the current price. As we understand the current state of inflation and that all households around the world are not equal, we will continue to run periodic sales to give everyone a chance to play Bloons TD 6.</li>\n<li>Creators</li>\n<li>We almost got Nexus.gg Creator code support in Update 32; we\u2019re taking more time with it and will release it with a 32.x update - this will allow viewers to add codes to the game that will share part of any IAP revenue with their favorite Creator.</li>\n<li>The Nexus.gg folks have been amazing to work with and we truly hope this will allow a virtuous cycle between player, Creator, and game developer. Ninja Kiwi doesn\u2019t think that paid sponsorships is good for the game-Creator-viewer/player ecosystem, but we think that Nexus.gg and Creator codes can be.</li>\n<li>Stay tuned to our socials for more information. The program will start with a selected group of Creators that we\u2019re already working with for previews and feedback, but Nexus.gg will have a signup page for other Creators who are interested. More news soon!</li>\n<li>Update 33</li>\n<li>Ace Paragon: Rounding out the land, sea, and air equation, we\u2019re eager to reveal what could be bigger than the BIG plane.</li>\n<li>New Boss - Dreadbloon: Inspired by the Monkey City boss and even more deadly in BTD6, with damage reduction, recurring shields, and rotating immunity to whole tower categories!</li>\n<li>2 new maps, pushing for one from the Reddit contest winners</li>\n<li>Quality of life, balance changes, bug fixes, and other improvements we can make</li>\n<li>Update 34</li>\n<li>Last update for the year!</li>\n<li>New Tower - Beast Handler: we\u2019re not saying anything but the name for this one, and we look forward to all of the speculation</li>\n<li>2 more maps - we\u2019re sensitive to community feedback about wanting more maps, so wanting to get another two in for end of year holidays</li>\n<li>More quality of life, balance changes, and improvements</li>\n<li>Further Out</li>\n<li>Console: We still have plans to release BTD6 on PlayStation and Xbox this year. Taking heaps of work to make it feel as native as possible but we really want to make 4 player couch co-op happen! Switch is not in production but we will consider after PlayStation and Xbox.</li>\n<li>Mods: Another huge amount of work to get this right, so we have to delay this until next year to get this right. The goal is to allow stat and visual changes to existing towers for even more fun and flexibility with visuals, memes, and Content Browser submissions</li>\n<li>Map Editor: Not sure if we can pull off both Mods and Map Editor in 2023 but we will go for it. In game tools to create and submit maps will be a huge avenue for community creativity that we want to open up!</li>\n<li>Bosses, Paragons, Towers, and Maps: Even with big features planned we will not forget about the core game and will continue to bring out fun and challenging new gameplay all year.</li>\n<li>Teams+: Contested Territories is just the beginning of what we can do together as Teams, so look for more ways to play with Friends, even as we continue to be dedicated to awesome single-player, offline gameplay as always</li>\n</ul></div>",

This overall seemed like a design flaw so that back-off distance has been moved up to the T4 instead. Apache Dartship has also fallen off over time as a viable saveup for prime, though it is meant to be reasonably difficult some changes have made this a little more difficult than it probably should be so we have increased the pierce of the machinegun attack.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>3xx Razor Rotor\u2019s pursuit no longer backs so far away from Leads that it can\u2019t hit them</li>\n<li>4xx Apache Dartship pursuit distance increase now occurs here</li>\n<li>4xx Apache Dartship Machinegun pierce increased 5 -&gt; 7</li>\n<li>5xx Apache Prime Machinegun pierce unchanged</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Dartling Gunner</p>\n<p>Ray of Doom suffers from the downsides of being designed as a high piercing tower, for the price this makes it feel far too weak against the round 100 BAD if you invest in it too early without some other forms of single target, to bring back a little of the interesting sort of targeting that the T4 has and help with this single target problem it will now deal a massive damage bonus to the first target hit along the beam\u2019s path.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>5xx Ray of Doom now deals bonus damage to the first target hit +55</li>\n<li>3xx Laser Cannon pierce increased from 4 -&gt; 6</li>\n<li>302 Laser Cannon pierce increased from 6 -&gt; 9</li>\n<li>xx2 Powerful Darts now also gives 'larger projectiles' as a crosspath</li>\n<li>002 Powerful Darts normal projectile size increased from 2 -&gt; 3</li>\n<li>032 Hydra Rocket Pods explosion size increased from 8 -&gt; 12</li>\n<li>402 Plasma Accelerator focal point size increased from 4 -&gt; 6</li>\n<li>402 Plasma Accelerator beam width increased from 2 -&gt; 3</li>\n<li>502 Ray of Doom beam width increased from 6 -&gt; 9</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Wizard Monkey</p>\n<p>Arcane Blast's benefit to the base tower is quite small for the price and also doesn't carry on well as a crosspath to the other T3s since they add new attacks instead of buffing the base attack, the price has been reduced to add a little more value here along with more MOAB damage at the T5 to give it a little more value over Arcane Spikes. As we somewhat expected the last Prince of Darkness rework didn\u2019t end up really nerfing it so much, so we are now following up with a small price nerf.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2xx Arcane Blast price reduced $600 -&gt; $450</li>\n<li>5xx Archmage bonus damage to MOABs 17 -&gt; 19</li>\n<li>xx5 Prince of Darkness price increased from $24,000 -&gt; 26,500</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Super Monkey</p>\n<p>Robo didn't need to lose pierce in the last Super Monkey T2 rework, and Dark Knight feels like it has too much pierce without ever considering the pierce crosspath. So to balance these together we\u2019ve taken out pierce from Dark Knight and added it back into x2x carrying up into Robo Monkey. Dark Champion pierce is increased rather than decreased to push it further ahead of Dark Knight.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>x2x Epic Range increases pierce further 3 -&gt; 4</li>\n<li>xx3 Dark Knight pierce decreased 5 -&gt; 4</li>\n<li>xx4 Dark Champion pierce increased 7 -&gt; 8</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ninja Monkey</p>\n<p>Grand Sabotage is extremely powerful in freeplay, but really boring outside of that one scaling mechanic. For a little more flavour with the shinobi mechanic, the T5 will now boost the potential of your shinobi army.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>x5x Grand Sabotage ability grants all your Shinobi on screen +5 range</li>\n<li>x5x Grand Sabotage ability grants all Shinobi +1 damage to MOABs</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Banana Farm</p>\n<p>Partially to help a little with tedious endgame farm collection in ranked boss events, or any other use you may desire for it, we have added a non-power form of easy banana collection. However we do not want to trivialize the intended downside of opting for a more micro intensive farm path too much, so this is still restricted behind a low-range tier 5 upgrade.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>xx5 Monkey Wall Street now collects nearby bananas/crates as a Monkey Farmer would</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Spike Factory</p>\n<p>To help make the tradeoff of building one T5 over multiple T4 not be as hard a choice, the basic attack on Carpet of Spikes has had power increased significantly over rate, range &amp; damage.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>x5x Carpet of Spikes range increased from 34 -&gt; 50</li>\n<li>x5x Carpet of Spikes main damage increased from 3 -&gt; 4</li>\n<li>x5x Carpet of Spikes main attack delay reduced 0.98s -&gt; 0.33</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Monkey Village</p>\n<p>Call to Arms ability suffers from uptime, for such an expensive upgrade which is such low range and purely support this makes it hard to use, so duration has now been increased to push it up to a 1/3rd uptime threshold</p>\n<ul>\n<li>x4x Call To Arms ability duration increased 12 -&gt; 15</li>\n<li>x5x Homeland duration remains unchanged</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Engineer</p>\n<p>Sentry Expert really needed some logic fixes to get more of the actual correct sentries placed at the right times, it has also received a number of power buffs across the board to the special sentries at T4 complimenting the new logic reworking. Cleansing Foam has had some extra crosspath utility added at the cost of a small price increase and a large decrease to Ultraboost price.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>4xx Sentry Expert logic has been reworked to evaluate threat levels based on Bloon types that it can counter, Bloon types that counter the sentries that it wants to spawn, and which of the current threats on screen is the greatest. Distribution of sentry types should scale based on how much one Bloon threat is more of a threat than another.</li>\n<li>4xx Sentry Expert Crush Sentry ceramic damage bonus increased from 1 -&gt; 4</li>\n<li>4xx Sentry Expert Crush Sentry damage type changed from Sharp -&gt; Shatter</li>\n<li>4xx Sentry Expert Bomb Sentry damage increased 2 -&gt; 4</li>\n<li>4xx Sentry Expert Cold Sentry pierce increased from 15 -&gt; 25</li>\n<li>4xx Sentry Expert Cold Sentry radius increased from 12 -&gt; 18</li>\n<li>4xx Sentry Expert Energy Sentry gain moab damage bonus of +2</li>\n<li>x3x Cleansing Foam price increased from 800 -&gt; 850</li>\n<li>032 Pin allows Cleansing Foam to slow Bloons 50% briefly</li>\n<li>130 Foam makes Sentries shoot Foamy nails that strip properties</li>\n<li>x5x Ultraboost price decreased from $120,000 -&gt; 105,000</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Gwendolin</p>\n<p>Gwendolin\u2019s Firestorm damage doesn\u2019t carry well into the endgame so has been buffed at a later level.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lv16 Firestorm base damage tic increases from 1 &gt; 5</li>\n<li>Lv16 Firestorm MOAB damage tic increases from 10 &gt; 15</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Pat Fusty</p>\n<p>Pat Fusty was initially given a smaller footprint than it felt he should have due to concerns about balance with his small radius, but actually has been extremely powerful for a long time despite these radius issues. We feel like now giving him back the footprint size that he always should have had similar to Churchill will add a reasonable lategame downside to consider without harming his early use so badly.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pat Fusty footprint increased from 7 -&gt; 8</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Admiral Brickell</p>\n<p>The Sea Mines delay that was added back in 29 has done well for reducing some of Brickells weaknesses, but as we expected somewhat does add in new weaknesses to rush rounds of Bloons that can now sneak past before all of her mines have been able to acquire a target. To help lessen this new issue she has gained a brand new ability that will allow more Sea Mines to rapidly deploy and find a target over a short duration.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lv7 Blast Chain utility ability added for Admiral Brickell. For 10 seconds all sea mines have their delay halved (the new one added in 29), &amp; their projectile speed doubled</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Psi</p>\n<p>We felt that Psi\u2019s early game too easily carried into some extremely powerful endgame setups. These setups were overperforming due to certain cooldown interactions with stalling out cooldown, however in an effort to try to avoid nerfing the cooldown for the average player we decided to make that stalling synergy harder to pull off instead.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Psi base price increased $800 -&gt; 1000</li>\n<li>Lv10 Psionic Scream ability 'speed of blow back' increased from bloon speed 300% -&gt; 600%</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Glue Rat</p>\n<p>Glue Rat pet has been overperforming in all game modes for a while now without any apparent weakness or strategic downsides.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Base movement speed ramping level endures persistently</li>\n<li>Max level goggle tightness loosened from Max -&gt; Sam</li>\n</ul></div>",

Juggernaut in general is also seeing a small utility knockback buff to help it carry on a little longer into the game.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>xx1 Long Range Darts also increases projectile lifespan +15%</li>\n<li>xx2 Enhanced Eyesight also increases projectile lifespan +20%</li>\n<li>4xx Juggernaut gains a slight Bloon knockback (Same as xx3 dartling, but half duration)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Bomb Shooter</p>\n<p>The Frags crosspath for top path Bomb Shooter has always been quite a poor choice, trying to compete with attack speed as a benefit for stun utility isn\u2019t going to ever work out so we have instead gone the route of turning the frags crosspath into a DPS/Stun hybrid with a lot of small buffs to frag power.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>302 Really Big Bombs frag damage increased 1 -&gt; 3</li>\n<li>302 Really Big Bombs gains more frags 8 -&gt; 12</li>\n<li>402 Bloon Impact frag pierce increased +1</li>\n<li>402 Bloon Impact frag damage increased 2 -&gt; 3</li>\n<li>402 Bloon Impact gains even more frags 8 -&gt; 16</li>\n<li>502 Bloon Crush remains at frag damage 12</li>\n<li>502 Bloon Crush frags gain bonus to ceramic +12</li>\n<li>502 Bloon Crush gains frag pierce 3 -&gt; 20</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Glue Gunner</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2xx Corrosive Glue DoT rate increased 2.3s -&gt; 2</li>\n<li>3xx Bloon Dissolver DoT ceramic bonus increased 0 -&gt; 1</li>\n<li>4xx Bloon Liquifier DoT ceramic bonus unchanged</li>\n<li>5xx The Bloon Solver bonus moab damage increased 3 -&gt; 5</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Monkey Sub</p>\n<p>Energizer upgrade offers nothing extra to the reactor sub aside from niche utility buffs, so we have increased the lategame cleanup potential by a large amount to help deal with Super Ceramics.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>5xx Energizer damage increased 3 -&gt; 5</li>\n<li>5xx Energizer now adds bonus damage to ceramics +5</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Monkey Buccaneer</p>\n<p>The base Grape attack of T4 MOAB Takedown has had a ceramic bonus added to lead up to the T5 a little better.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>x4x MOAB Takedown grapeshot ceramic bonus added +1</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Monkey Ace</p>\n<p>Spy Plane is always a lesser crosspath aside from specific challenges that call for camo detection. It has a similar vibe to Night Vision sniper so we have given it a similar buff.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>x2x Spy Plane grants attacks bonus damage to camos +1</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Heli Pilot</p>\n<p>Previously Razor Rotor\u2019s used to make the heli pursue for a further distance &amp; this caused it to often fail to reach Lead Bloons with the rotor attack that could pop them. This overall seemed like a design flaw so that back-off distance has been moved up to the T4 instead. Apache Dartship has also fallen off over time as a viable saveup for prime, though it is meant to be reasonably difficult some changes have made this a little more difficult than it probably should be so we have increased the pierce of the machinegun attack.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>3xx Razor Rotor\u2019s pursuit no longer backs so far away from Leads that it can\u2019t hit them</li>\n<li>4xx Apache Dartship pursuit distance increase now occurs here</li>\n<li>4xx Apache Dartship Machinegun pierce increased 5 -&gt; 7</li>\n<li>5xx Apache Prime Machinegun pierce unchanged</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Dartling Gunner</p>\n<p>Ray of Doom suffers from the downsides of being designed as a high piercing tower, for the price this makes it feel far too weak against the round 100 BAD if you invest in it too early without some other forms of single target, to bring back a little of the interesting sort of targeting that the T4 has and help with this single target problem it will now deal a massive damage bonus to the first target hit along the beam\u2019s path.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>5xx Ray of Doom now deals bonus damage to the first target hit +55</li>\n<li>3xx Laser Cannon pierce increased from 4 -&gt; 6</li>\n<li>302 Laser Cannon pierce increased from 6 -&gt; 9</li>\n<li>xx2 Powerful Darts now also gives 'larger projectiles' as a crosspath</li>\n<li>002 Powerful Darts normal projectile size increased from 2 -&gt; 3</li>\n<li>032 Hydra Rocket Pods explosion size increased from 8 -&gt; 12</li>\n<li>402 Plasma Accelerator focal point size increased from 4 -&gt; 6</li>\n<li>402 Plasma Accelerator beam width increased from 2 -&gt; 3</li>\n<li>502 Ray of Doom beam width increased from 6 -&gt; 9</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Wizard Monkey</p>\n<p>Arcane Blast's benefit to the base tower is quite small for the price and also doesn't carry on well as a crosspath to the other T3s since they add new attacks instead of buffing the base attack, the price has been reduced to add a little more value here along with more MOAB damage at the T5 to give it a little more value over Arcane Spikes. As we somewhat expected the last Prince of Darkness rework didn\u2019t end up really nerfing it so much, so we are now following up with a small price nerf.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2xx Arcane Blast price reduced $600 -&gt; $450</li>\n<li>5xx Archmage bonus damage to MOABs 17 -&gt; 19</li>\n<li>xx5 Prince of Darkness price increased from $24,000 -&gt; 26,500</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Super Monkey</p>\n<p>Robo didn't need to lose pierce in the last Super Monkey T2 rework, and Dark Knight feels like it has too much pierce without ever considering the pierce crosspath. So to balance these together we\u2019ve taken out pierce from Dark Knight and added it back into x2x carrying up into Robo Monkey. Dark Champion pierce is increased rather than decreased to push it further ahead of Dark Knight.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>x2x Epic Range increases pierce further 3 -&gt; 4</li>\n<li>xx3 Dark Knight pierce decreased 5 -&gt; 4</li>\n<li>xx4 Dark Champion pierce increased 7 -&gt; 8</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ninja Monkey</p>\n<p>Grand Sabotage is extremely powerful in freeplay, but really boring outside of that one scaling mechanic. For a little more flavour with the shinobi mechanic, the T5 will now boost the potential of your shinobi army.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>x5x Grand Sabotage ability grants all your Shinobi on screen +5 range</li>\n<li>x5x Grand Sabotage ability grants all Shinobi +1 damage to MOABs</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Banana Farm</p>\n<p>Partially to help a little with tedious endgame farm collection in ranked boss events, or any other use you may desire for it, we have added a non-power form of easy banana collection. However  we do not want to trivialize the intended downside of opting for a more micro intensive farm path too much, so this is still restricted behind a low-range tier 5 upgrade.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>xx5 Monkey Wall Street now collects nearby bananas/crates as a Monkey Farmer would</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Spike Factory</p>\n<p>To help make the tradeoff of building one T5 over multiple T4 not be as hard a choice, the basic attack on Carpet of Spikes has had power increased significantly over rate, range &amp; damage.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>x5x Carpet of Spikes range increased from 34 -&gt; 50</li>\n<li>x5x Carpet of Spikes main damage increased from 3 -&gt; 4</li>\n<li>x5x Carpet of Spikes main attack delay reduced 0.98s -&gt; 0.33</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Monkey Village</p>\n<p>Call to Arms ability suffers from uptime, for such an expensive upgrade which is such low range and purely support this makes it hard to use, so duration has now been increased to push it up to a 1/3rd uptime threshold</p>\n<ul>\n<li>x4x Call To Arms ability duration increased 12 -&gt; 15</li>\n<li>x5x Homeland duration remains unchanged</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Engineer</p>\n<p>Sentry Expert really needed some logic fixes to get more of the actual correct sentries placed at the right times, it has also received a number of power buffs across the board to the special sentries at T4 complimenting the new logic reworking. Cleansing Foam has had some extra crosspath utility added at the cost of a small price increase and a large decrease to Ultraboost price.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>4xx Sentry Expert logic has been reworked to evaluate threat levels based on Bloon types that it can counter, Bloon types that counter the sentries that it wants to spawn, and which of the current threats on screen is the greatest. Distribution of sentry types should scale based on how much one Bloon threat is more of a threat than another.</li>\n<li>4xx Sentry Expert Crush Sentry ceramic damage bonus increased from 1 -&gt; 4</li>\n<li>4xx Sentry Expert Crush Sentry damage type changed from Sharp -&gt; Shatter</li>\n<li>4xx Sentry Expert Bomb Sentry damage increased 2 -&gt; 4</li>\n<li>4xx Sentry Expert Cold Sentry pierce increased from 15 -&gt; 25</li>\n<li>4xx Sentry Expert Cold Sentry radius increased from 12 -&gt; 18</li>\n<li>4xx Sentry Expert Energy Sentry gain moab damage bonus of +2</li>\n<li>x3x Cleansing Foam price increased from 800 -&gt; 850</li>\n<li>032 Pin allows Cleansing Foam to slow Bloons 50% briefly</li>\n<li>130 Foam makes Sentries shoot Foamy nails that strip properties</li>\n<li>x5x Ultraboost price decreased from $120,000 -&gt; 105,000</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Gwendolin</p>\n<p>Gwendolin\u2019s Firestorm damage doesn\u2019t carry well into the endgame so has been buffed at a later level.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lv16 Firestorm base damage tic increases from 1 &gt; 5</li>\n<li>Lv16 Firestorm MOAB damage tic increases from 10 &gt; 15</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Pat Fusty</p>\n<p>Pat Fusty was initially given a smaller footprint than it felt he should have due to concerns about balance with his small radius, but actually has been extremely powerful for a long time despite these radius issues. We feel like now giving him back the footprint size that he always should have had similar to Churchill will add a reasonable lategame downside to consider without harming his early use so badly.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pat Fusty footprint increased from 7 -&gt; 8</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Admiral Brickell</p>\n<p>The Sea Mines delay that was added back in 29 has done well for reducing some of Brickells weaknesses, but as we expected somewhat does add in new weaknesses to rush rounds of Bloons that can now sneak past before all of her mines have been able to acquire a target. To help lessen this new issue she has gained a brand new ability that will allow more Sea Mines to rapidly deploy and find a target over a short duration.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lv7 Blast Chain utility ability added for Admiral Brickell. For 10 seconds all sea mines have their delay halved (the new one added in 29), &amp; their projectile speed doubled</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Psi</p>\n<p>We felt that Psi\u2019s early game too easily carried into some extremely powerful endgame setups. These setups were overperforming due to certain cooldown interactions with stalling out cooldown, however in an effort to try to avoid nerfing the cooldown for the average player we decided to make that stalling synergy harder to pull off instead.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Psi base price increased $800 -&gt; 1000</li>\n<li>Lv10 Psionic Scream ability 'speed of blow back' increased from bloon speed 300% -&gt; 600%</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Glue Rat</p>\n<p>Glue Rat pet has been overperforming in all game modes for a while now without any apparent weakness or strategic downsides.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Base movement speed ramping level endures persistently</li>\n<li>Max level goggle tightness loosened from Max -&gt; Sam</li>\n</ul></div>",
