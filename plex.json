Obviously I don't want them in front of the TV all day but sometimes I just need to sit them down so I can have some peace haha.

It lets you handle tasks like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Adding movies and shows to Plex</strong> with simple commands.</li>\n<li><strong>Showing trailer links</strong> for titles you're curious about.</li>\n<li><strong>Distinguishing between 4K and non-4K content</strong> when making requests.</li>\n<li><strong>Providing progress updates and ETAs</strong> on downloads.</li>\n<li><strong>Offering direct links to watch content</strong> in Plex.</li>\n<li><strong>Supporting bulk requests</strong> (e.g., \"Add The Dark Knight, The Simpsons, and The Simpsons Movie.\")</li>\n<li><strong>Answering general questions and making recommendations</strong> about what to watch.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Why Did I Make This?</h3>\n<p>No big reason, really. I wanted to practice building Custom GPTs and had a bit of free time. It turned out to be pretty fun to use, especially for quickly finding and adding content. You can even share it with friends or family so they can make requests too.</p>\n<h3>Want to Try It Out?</h3>\n<p>If you already have Plex, Sonarr, Radarr, and Overseerr running, it only takes <strong>5-10 minutes</strong> to set up. You will also need a <strong>ChatGPT Plus subscription</strong>.</p>\n<p>I put together a <a href=\"https://github.com/UnderwaterOverground/Plex-Concierge\">GitHub Repo</a> with the steps and snippets I used for my setup. No need for extra hosting.</p>\n<p>Feel free to check it out and let me know if you give it a shot!</p>",

I hated the static recomendation rows that plex currently uses so I made this tool to dynamically change the displayed rows. I made a GUI to make it easier to use. I figured there was a good chance someone else would find this useful. Please let me know if there are any features you'd like to see implemented!</p>\n<p>The github readme has a full breakdown of features and screenshots of the GUI. The GUI took me awhile and I wouldn't be shocked if very specific user behavior may cause issues.

I watched it while it was airing but she didn't watch it with me. Fast forward to her being on maternity leave and she wants to watch it now. No problem, let me check my Justwatch app, it's not streaming anywhere. I'll just see if I can find it cheap used somewhere. Nope. For the price difference between new and used, I'll just get it new and use the digital codes for Fandango at home..... the codes are expired and Warner Bros. absolutely refuses to do anything.</p>\n<p>Started watching Westworld, using my Xbox as the player. Audio was desync'd. Bad. I'll just buy a Blu-ray  drive and rip it all. And host it on... </p>\n<p>Research, research research. I'll set up a Plex server (not jellyfin) I had one 10 years ago and I liked it. </p>\n<p>Host it on my PC and quickly fill up half of my 2tb drive. </p>\n<p>Do some more research and decide to build a NAS, I have most of a computer in a box somewhere, so it won't cost me that much. My old i7-6700k, 32gb RAM and a 500gb nvme. Set it up with TrueNAS scale and order a few hdd to get started. </p>\n<p>So now I'm 2 weeks into ripping my 4k collection and adding all the tv shows I like or haven't seen yet, movies that I haven't watched in awhile and cartoons for the kids.</p>\n<p>Now I've bought 4 12TB hddd, used 10TB of my 31TB sthidden (1 drive is for parity), have 6 family/friends that watch my Plex library regularly and have gone down the ARRs rabbit hole. </p>\n<p>Oh yeah, how is Plex ruining my marriage? I've spent so much time and money on this thing that I think she's getting jealous. Lol</p>",

I wasn't thinking about Black Friday discounts, but when I saw some ads for the 25% off I was kicking myself a bit. I thought \"might as well ask if I can get that retroactively applied. Worst they can say is no\". I wrote three sentences explaining what happened yesterday afternoon and this morning I got an email back telling me my Plex Pass has been cancelled and refunded so I can save an extra $30. I wouldn't have thrown a fit if I was told no, but they did a cool thing for me and I want to recognize that. Thanks Plex :)</p>",

I was going through my parents stuff and found a ton of DVDs and movies. I had been interested in making a server for a while, but this pushed me into it.

I want to primarily use it as my Plex media server (current Plex media server in second pic)  and possibly game servers like Beamng Drive MP and Assetto Corsa for example. I'm completely new to this sort of setup and don't really know where to start. I'll be putting the server under my house in the garage and I understand that I'll need to run 2 ethernet cables to it. I've heard things like Unraid and dockers are the way to go. Any suggestions or advice on how to get started in setting it up? Thanks in advance \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb</p>",

I dabble in all three and enjoy learning about them. Are there some things that I don't like about Plex? Yes. Are there things other platforms excel at, also yes. Does Plex do most of what Plex enthusiast are here for? Absolutely. But, going in to another subreddit to \"correct\" everyone on their \"ignorance\" or \"sins\" of supporting a platform, whether it's Plex or how you orient your toilet paper, is a bit abrasive. Very few Jellys post anything helpful. Oftentimes it's condescending towards those who are not well versed on networking and home server setups. If users need info on your platform, they will seek you out. Plex users don't post incessantly in the Jellyfin subreddit about it's virtues. No need to badger the ones that enjoy it. Instead offer solutions you found that may translate to solving issues users face with Plex. We CAN coexist peacefully.</p>\n<p>*End Rant* </p>",

I know that the Amazon fire sticks do the same auto play video ads on the screen so that's off the table, so my question is what options do I have for new players that have both wired and wireless network connections that aren't too expensive (Nvidia shield) and will still play most files?</p>\n<p>I'm sad to see the enshitification of Roku.

I have heard time and time again that Emby and/or Jellyfin are better for x, y, or z reasons, but that was not my experience at all. Both of them organized my libraries horrendously, where Plex handles them like a champ. Sometimes even Plex fumbles the ball a little, but never have I seen such a disorganized mess than I did on those other platforms. </p>\n<p>Maybe it's too harsh to fault the others for poor library organization, but IMO that's a huge part of the experience of watching your content. If you can't even find the show or movie you want to watch from your library, what's even the point? </p>\n<p>I do hope the others can catch up to Plex, because we need good competition in this space.

It is the first streaming device to fully support all DV profiles just like a physical UHD player (eg UB820). Kodi add-ons like Plex install as usual. TrueHD and DTS audio are also supported. Buy the Ugoos AM6b+, load up CoreElec onto a microSD card, install the Plex add-on and enjoy. I've completely replaced my Shield Pro 2019 last week and DV remuxes have never looked better.</p>\n<p>Long answer:</p>\n<p>For those that don't know, there is an open source project called \"CoreElec\". The goal of this project was to run Kodi natively on Linux. It is now very mature and about a year ago, the CoreElec team obtained Dolby certification for 2x \"generic\" Android TV streaming boxes. They are the Ugoos AM6b+ and the Minix U22X-J. Since then they've been hard a work adding Dolby Vision playback to the above 2x players.</p>\n<p>The CoreElec team has announced 2x weeks ago that their newest stable release fully plays back ALL Dolby Vision profiles, including P7 FEL flawlessly. These streaming boxes also handle both TrueHD and DTS codecs providing for an ideal Plex/remux experience.</p>\n<p>I personally tested the latest CoreElec release on the Ugoos AM6b+ and it is amazing. Plex is installed onto Kodi via PlexMod4Kodi. No issues playing back any native DV remuxes or hybrid DV remuxes. Support for all lossless audio as well as passthrough. SDR/HDR content plays back as usual.</p>\n<p>This is extremely exciting since this is the first time any streaming player can handle both Plex and P7 FEL marking an significant improvement onto the Shield Pro. </p>\n<p>Most people here won't care. But if you collect remuxes and have a DV enabled panel, upgrading to the Ugoos AM6b+ with CoreElec is - imo - mandatory.</p>",
