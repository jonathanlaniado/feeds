Even with the \"bad\" updates and the questionable choices, Plex is still vastly superior to Jellyfin.</p>\n<p>I was hoping the quality and feature gap would be much less given how long the two products have been available, but the rift is simply gigantic. This is disheartening because competition always breeds innovation. The Jellyfin devs simply can't seem to get out of their own way and deliver a quality product everybody can enjoy and use, rather than something that the devs deem good enough for their objectives.</p>\n<p>On the exact same hardware and the exact same media library Plex hums along nicely while Jellyfin consumes all host resources and is super slow for all actions. I would love to share my experiences with r/jellyfin but that sub is apparently not for general discussion and is meant only for product announcements. Again, no community involvement there.</p>\n<p>I've been a Plex lifetime subscription user for many years and have happily used it for that time. I've really been rooting for the Jellyfin guys for just as long. But alas, Plex is a superior product. Not simply because of more resources, but because of better product vision. Without a sea change at Jellyfin it will unfortunately remain that way.</p>",

This will separate out \"Doctor Who (1963)\" and \"Doctor Who (2005)\" with ease. You'll also see in photo that I have baked in the Season poster, which will automatically be picked up by Plex and used as your default poster after scanning.</p>\n<p>All this being said, you could dump 200GB worth of this onto your server, scan it once, and also have a full and complete library immediately.</p>\n<p>The only thing that could be left is giving each episode (all 700 of them) an Episode Poster. Coincidentally I did find someone who made all the posters, but the only way I see this working is if I manually sort and rename every single poster (yes, all 700 of them). <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/DV5sNYk.png\">I only did it on a few episodes just to see if it would work, and it did.</a></p>\n<p>If anyone knows a way to (easily) take file names, copy it, associate it to the right poster, and then rename the poster to an identical name, and then repeat ... I might give it a shot. <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/cKst89I.png\">But as of right now, I renamed four posters and then stopped while my eyes have not started bleeding.</a></p>",

I basically use Plex for watching my own media, and only very rarely stream Plex-hosted content, and even then its usually movies or shows from the 30s-50s. I pretty much stopped altogether once they started including advertisements though.</p>\n<p>First thing... If I happen to have a show or movie that Plex also offers via streaming, both versions of the media will show up in the Continue Watching section, which are virtually indestinguishable and the Plex-offered version contains ads. This freaked me out until I saw what was going on. The only way I can obviously tell the difference is that one contains a File Type option in a buried menu. I can't see a way to disable this from happening without disabling Plex streaming services entirely. This has been happening for a while and I'm curious if anyone has found a way around this, or if there's some new setting somewhere.</p>\n<p>Second... My wife was flipping around and we found a season of Price is Right from '82, so tried watching an episode. After about 10-ish mins, the very first ad it played was for Skyn condoms and fairly risque, and we were like wtf this is wildly inappropriate but kept watching anyway. When it got to the next ad break it was a 3 minutes cycle and in Spanish, so we just gave up watching altogether. Is there a way to at least keep the ads to G-rated ones, preferably in English?</p>\n<p>If I can't disable adult-oriented ads I'll need to disable Plex streaming entirely because of kids watching. The last thing I need is for Plex to show these types of commercials during kids cartoons or similar. Separate profiles are not a viable solution if we're all sitting together and watching something as a family.</p>",

It lets you handle tasks like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Adding movies and shows to Plex</strong> with simple commands.</li>\n<li><strong>Showing trailer links</strong> for titles you're curious about.</li>\n<li><strong>Distinguishing between 4K and non-4K content</strong> when making requests.</li>\n<li><strong>Providing progress updates and ETAs</strong> on downloads.</li>\n<li><strong>Offering direct links to watch content</strong> in Plex.</li>\n<li><strong>Supporting bulk requests</strong> (e.g., \"Add The Dark Knight, The Simpsons, and The Simpsons Movie.\")</li>\n<li><strong>Answering general questions and making recommendations</strong> about what to watch.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Why Did I Make This?</h3>\n<p>No big reason, really. I wanted to practice building Custom GPTs and had a bit of free time. It turned out to be pretty fun to use, especially for quickly finding and adding content. You can even share it with friends or family so they can make requests too.</p>\n<h3>Want to Try It Out?</h3>\n<p>If you already have Plex, Sonarr, Radarr, and Overseerr running, it only takes <strong>5-10 minutes</strong> to set up. You will also need a <strong>ChatGPT Plus subscription</strong>.</p>\n<p>I put together a <a href=\"https://github.com/UnderwaterOverground/Plex-Concierge\">GitHub Repo</a> with the steps and snippets I used for my setup. No need for extra hosting.</p>\n<p>Feel free to check it out and let me know if you give it a shot!</p>",

I hated the static recomendation rows that plex currently uses so I made this tool to dynamically change the displayed rows. I made a GUI to make it easier to use. I figured there was a good chance someone else would find this useful. Please let me know if there are any features you'd like to see implemented!</p>\n<p>The github readme has a full breakdown of features and screenshots of the GUI. The GUI took me awhile and I wouldn't be shocked if very specific user behavior may cause issues.

For the price difference between new and used, I'll just get it new and use the digital codes for Fandango at home..... the codes are expired and Warner Bros. absolutely refuses to do anything.</p>\n<p>Started watching Westworld, using my Xbox as the player. Audio was desync'd. Bad. I'll just buy a Blu-ray  drive and rip it all. And host it on... </p>\n<p>Research, research research. I'll set up a Plex server (not jellyfin) I had one 10 years ago and I liked it. </p>\n<p>Host it on my PC and quickly fill up half of my 2tb drive. </p>\n<p>Do some more research and decide to build a NAS, I have most of a computer in a box somewhere, so it won't cost me that much. My old i7-6700k, 32gb RAM and a 500gb nvme. Set it up with TrueNAS scale and order a few hdd to get started. </p>\n<p>So now I'm 2 weeks into ripping my 4k collection and adding all the tv shows I like or haven't seen yet, movies that I haven't watched in awhile and cartoons for the kids.</p>\n<p>Now I've bought 4 12TB hddd, used 10TB of my 31TB sthidden (1 drive is for parity), have 6 family/friends that watch my Plex library regularly and have gone down the ARRs rabbit hole. </p>\n<p>Oh yeah, how is Plex ruining my marriage? I've spent so much time and money on this thing that I think she's getting jealous. Lol</p>",

I want to primarily use it as my Plex media server (current Plex media server in second pic)  and possibly game servers like Beamng Drive MP and Assetto Corsa for example. I'm completely new to this sort of setup and don't really know where to start. I'll be putting the server under my house in the garage and I understand that I'll need to run 2 ethernet cables to it. I've heard things like Unraid and dockers are the way to go. Any suggestions or advice on how to get started in setting it up? Thanks in advance \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb</p>",

I dabble in all three and enjoy learning about them. Are there some things that I don't like about Plex? Yes. Are there things other platforms excel at, also yes. Does Plex do most of what Plex enthusiast are here for? Absolutely. But, going in to another subreddit to \"correct\" everyone on their \"ignorance\" or \"sins\" of supporting a platform, whether it's Plex or how you orient your toilet paper, is a bit abrasive. Very few Jellys post anything helpful. Oftentimes it's condescending towards those who are not well versed on networking and home server setups. If users need info on your platform, they will seek you out. Plex users don't post incessantly in the Jellyfin subreddit about it's virtues. No need to badger the ones that enjoy it. Instead offer solutions you found that may translate to solving issues users face with Plex. We CAN coexist peacefully.</p>\n<p>*End Rant* </p>",
