It also tells me about streams and bandwith too! </p>\n<p>Beneath that are my various queues, and beneath that is a little way to see the status of each service I'm running - a green light means it's all good and working properly!</p>\n<p>Lastly I have some average speedtest data (yay for slow Australian internet :( ), and the calendar so I know when things are coming out!</p>\n<p>It was definitely very satisfying getting it all working together, so I hope you like it too!</p>\n<p>Does anyone else have their own dashboards they want to share? Now that it's all done, I want to add more stuff, but can't think of anything else to add :P!</p></div>",
