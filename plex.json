It is the first streaming device to fully support all DV profiles just like a physical UHD player (eg UB820). Kodi add-ons like Plex install as usual. TrueHD and DTS audio are also supported. Buy the Ugoos AM6b+, load up CoreElec onto a microSD card, install the Plex add-on and enjoy. I've completely replaced my Shield Pro 2019 last week and DV remuxes have never looked better.</p>\n<p>Long answer:</p>\n<p>For those that don't know, there is an open source project called \"CoreElec\". The goal of this project was to run Kodi natively on Linux. It is now very mature and about a year ago, the CoreElec team obtained Dolby certification for 2x \"generic\" Android TV streaming boxes. They are the Ugoos AM6b+ and the Minix U22X-J. Since then they've been hard a work adding Dolby Vision playback to the above 2x players.</p>\n<p>The CoreElec team has announced 2x weeks ago that their newest stable release fully plays back ALL Dolby Vision profiles, including P7 FEL flawlessly. These streaming boxes also handle both TrueHD and DTS codecs providing for an ideal Plex/remux experience.</p>\n<p>I personally tested the latest CoreElec release on the Ugoos AM6b+ and it is amazing. Plex is installed onto Kodi via PlexMod4Kodi. No issues playing back any native DV remuxes or hybrid DV remuxes. Support for all lossless audio as well as passthrough. SDR/HDR content plays back as usual.</p>\n<p>This is extremely exciting since this is the first time any streaming player can handle both Plex and P7 FEL marking an significant improvement onto the Shield Pro. </p>\n<p>Most people here won't care. But if you collect remuxes and have a DV enabled panel, upgrading to the Ugoos AM6b+ with CoreElec is - imo - mandatory.</p>",

I've struggled with getting GPU hardware transcoding working, despite the fact that I seemingly met all the requirements. I thought maybe my \"older\" nvidia card's GPU core was to blame and recently updated to a 1660S with no appreciable improvement. I saw .5x transcoding for DoVi/HDR content with tone mapping, or ~1-2x if I disabled tone mapping.</p>\n<p>Banging my head against the wall, I came to realize I WAS STILL RUNNING 32 BIT PLEX. I had installed server SO LONG AGO that I never upgraded to 64 bit.</p>\n<p>Upgrading to 64 bit was the single most absurd performance improvement for server I've ever seen. I am now able to transcode 4K DoVi/HDR with tone mapping so fast that Plex is throttling (taking a break). My GPU use during transcodes went from 10-20% to 95%+.</p>\n<p>Yes, I know, don't transcode - in my home I run multiple Shields. But sometimes on the road that isn't an option. It's kind of wild to me my server never nudged me to see if I wanted to bump to 64.</p>\n<p><strong>How to check and upgrade (Windows)</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Open Task Manager</li>\n<li>Go to Details</li>\n<li>Right click on the top bar -&gt; Select Columns</li>\n<li>Check \"Platform\"</li>\n<li>Find Plex in the list - is it 32 bit?</li>\n<li>If so, go download server again and choose the 64 bit option.</li>\n<li>Run the installer; it will detect you are on 32 and uninstall/upgrade while maintaining all of your settings.</li>\n</ul>",

It's the first time I run into something like this and I'm confused as I don't know if I can have like two versions of the same episode which I can then choose on my TV or what.</p></div>",
