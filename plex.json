When selecting the opt-out radio buttons and saving your preferences, the only network requests sent are for Fullstory (a user tracking service) and Facebook. https://imgur.com/a/KoJlXgv</p>\n<p>Now, unless Plex is somehow managing their data sharing preferences through Fullstory (which would be <em>very</em> strange) and also has decided to for some reason not show you the opt-out state that's saved on their end, then they're not actually allowing their users to opt out of data sharing with a 3rd party vendor. </p>\n<p>If this assessment is wrong, it would be <strong>really helpful</strong> if someone from Plex could clarify.</p>\n<p>EDIT: See comments below, this may be broken only on some browsers?</p>",

A large button that is easy to press for my child.</p>\n<p>The button isn't wireless, but for my setup it's okay.  I have set up their own media section on the server, so their favorite shows are all jumbled together.  It doesn't matter if there are proper descriptions or posters for them since they won't be seen in the their selection.</p>\n<p>Plex code below isn't production quality, but for a couple hours of hacking and testing in-between fortnite games, it works.

My collection even further back(XBMC). I painstakingly go through the posters and cover art to make sure they are nice. I update files to better quality ones to keep up with better displays. Add interesting content as I find it. Content from multiple decades(1970s-current). You all know the drill.</p>\n<p>So with upgraded internet connection, I can finally start to watch Plex outside of my home. It is a burden of living well into the country side(services lag behind). So my wife offers one of her friends access to Plex. I don't take issue with it. In all honesty, I didn't mind load testing it. I wanted to experiment.</p>\n<p>This woman has watched Jaws 21 times in 30 days. I can't wrap my head around that. I like certain movies as well but damn not that much.</p></div>",
