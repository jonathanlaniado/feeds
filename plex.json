Which is totally untrue.</p>\n<p>I do have a fairly large library (\\~10TB) ... on a 10 yo Synology NAS and plex on a HP promini desktop pc with an I3, I was proud when I tested that it could manage 3 concurrent streams xD</p>\n<p>My library was shared with friends an family and all of them got an email stating that I've been profiting from this, most of them sent me a message asking what did I do and if I was ok ( xD)</p>\n<p>It is pretty infuriating that plex automatically suspends accounts without any advice, sending all contacts a notification like this. And I am sure this is automated and there is no human checking the activity of my library, as it is pretty low (maybe 10 streams a week at most, many weeks it is totally unused) and the hardware is totally unprepared to serve many users.</p>\n<p>And to top it all this is just a few months after I paid a lifetime subscription xD</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>I'd love to go back in time, delete plex and go to any open source alternative.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Edit: spelling, clarification</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Update: Plex has restored my account via email :)</p></div>",

Once I told them it was a server issue, they all started offering to help pay for any repairs necessary (which I turned down because I don't want to take money) and the tech-minded ones were offering troubleshooting assistance. It turns out that about half of them solely use my Plex now and don't have any other streaming services.</p>\n<p>The whole thing was pretty funny, and now I know that if I ever have an emergency where I can't call for help, I can just disconnect the power for the server and someone will come looking for me shortly.</p></div>",

My collection even further back(XBMC). I painstakingly go through the posters and cover art to make sure they are nice. I update files to better quality ones to keep up with better displays. Add interesting content as I find it. Content from multiple decades(1970s-current). You all know the drill.</p>\n<p>So with upgraded internet connection, I can finally start to watch Plex outside of my home. It is a burden of living well into the country side(services lag behind). So my wife offers one of her friends access to Plex. I don't take issue with it. In all honesty, I didn't mind load testing it. I wanted to experiment.</p>\n<p>This woman has watched Jaws 21 times in 30 days. I can't wrap my head around that. I like certain movies as well but damn not that much.</p></div>",

We immediately began an investigation and it does appear that a third-party was able to access a limited subset of data that includes emails, usernames, and encrypted passwords. Even though all account passwords that could have been accessed were hashed and secured in accordance with best practices, out of an abundance of caution we are requiring all Plex accounts to have their password reset.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So were these passwords encrypted, in which case they could be decrypted if the adversary got the key, or hashed? Hashed passwords leaking would be much less of an issue.</p>\n<p>Edit: Encryption and hashing is <strong>not</strong> the same thing.</p>\n<p>Edit2: Passwords were hashed with salt, not encrypted (<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/PleX/comments/wwb8uy/plex_breached_were_passwords_encrypted_or_hashed/ilkbawb/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3\">see this comment</a>)</p>\n<p>Edit3: Just for clarity this is the best case scenario. It\u2019s difficult to reverse hashed passwords unless they are very simple. Plex got the word out quickly so we have plenty of time to change our passwords. Kudos!</p>\n<p>This is why you never reuse password, use a password manager and enable 2fa wherever you can. :)</p></div>",

That's why I go through the trouble of configuring it. </p>\n<p>The truth is that, if I wanted to, I could just make a UPnP server and tell people to use BubbleUPnP and stuff . And it would basically work. <em>I</em> know I could definitely use it to play stuff from my tablet or TV. But the problem is my parents. I'd like them to use my content as well, and they constantly use it. And that's the whole reason I am using Plex, because it similar to playing stuff from other streaming sites.</p>\n<p>I am not opposed to Plex investing dev time in weird features or in trying to monetize in additional ways. But these changes shouldn't come in detriment of Plex's main job. And making the main page so complicated to use, telling users to use 'Discover' . Filling things up with 'Live TV' from weird internet channels. It's a lot of pollution. It's worse when these changes can happen overnight. If my parents are used to one UI and it suddenly changes and they need my in-person assistance to reorder the home page, then Plex has failed to do its main job. If it becomes harder to find my content, then plex has failed to do its main job.</p></div>",

Now it seems we're going in the opposite directions, specifically:</p>\n<p>1) There's a maybe 40% chance I can't play any given file on my Plex Apple TV client connected to a 1080P TV. Either no audio, or it dies a few moments into the video. I've tried all manner of streaming settings and often get the same effect on another Apple TV 4K connected to a 4K projector. The same files will play just fine on Infuse. I'll occasionally check the Plex forums and there's all manner of settings tweaks that don't quite work, and then someone swoops in and blames AppleTV, which might make sense if Infuse didn't work perfectly.</p>\n<p>2) The \"much better than the old sync\" Download feature on iOS is hot garbage. I've started traveling again and find this hugely frustrating. With the old sync feature I could flag 1-6 shows or movies before I went to bed, everything would transcode on the server overnight, and in the AM I could sync hours of content flawlessly in maybe 20 minutes over WiFi. With Downloads I'm lucky if I can get a 2 episodes of a single show and that's if I leave the iPad on, with Plex open, and babysit the thing.</p>\n<p>I get it that Plex wants to become a super-cool streaming company and do an IPO and be like Netflix Jr. and fly around on the G6 and do lines off Vegan Leather seats like the WeWork guy, but can we just get the basics of playing local media perfect before we launch crappy Live TV or allow me to search Netflix without using Netflix?!?!</p></div>",

Then about a year ago one of my friends said nothing works anymore. I went through all kinds of trouble shooting and even drove over to his house one time and got it working by cranking the quality way down (480p). He said after a while even that had to stop and buffer though so he gave up and just bought Netflix. Fast forward to a month ago, I set up my girlfriend on Plex but she has the same issues. I then realise they are the only ones on the same ISP. I reach out to a buddy whose partner just so happens to be high level at that ISP. And just last week they got back to me saying they have flagged it as pirating software and anything being sent through that will be throttled way down because of this.\nI'm getting them to set up a VPN to be able to use Plex. Just thought I would let people on here know that if Plex gets flagged and throttled by more and more ISPs this could be an issue for more.</p>\n<p>The ISP is Bell MTS</p>\n<p>Edit: Thanks guys, I'll try to switch the Port tonight and report back if that works!</p></div>",
