These videos have been stored away for decades and watching them used to be an ordeal, having to connect the video player to the TV.  After digitizing the video tapes, all I had to do was create a new library in Plex for these personal treasures that we can watch anytime and anywhere we want. </p>",

All you childless dickheads with your disposable incomes, free time, and easy holidays, can\u2019t understand the need to keep a 5 year-old occupied on a four-hour cross-country flight. But even the crunchiest of you typewriter-carrying, avocado-eating, child-free hipsters, can understand the utility of having All Holes Filled With Black Dongers 5 at your fingertips when you\u2019re at your off-grid AirBNB log cabin for a long weekend. </p>\n<p>Thank you for coming to my TED Talk.</p><div><br></div><img src=\"https://i.redd.it/3g7b9knphjge1.jpeg\" />",

I basically use Plex for watching my own media, and only very rarely stream Plex-hosted content, and even then its usually movies or shows from the 30s-50s. I pretty much stopped altogether once they started including advertisements though.</p>\n<p>First thing... If I happen to have a show or movie that Plex also offers via streaming, both versions of the media will show up in the Continue Watching section, which are virtually indestinguishable and the Plex-offered version contains ads. This freaked me out until I saw what was going on. The only way I can obviously tell the difference is that one contains a File Type option in a buried menu. I can't see a way to disable this from happening without disabling Plex streaming services entirely. This has been happening for a while and I'm curious if anyone has found a way around this, or if there's some new setting somewhere.</p>\n<p>Second... My wife was flipping around and we found a season of Price is Right from '82, so tried watching an episode. After about 10-ish mins, the very first ad it played was for Skyn condoms and fairly risque, and we were like wtf this is wildly inappropriate but kept watching anyway. When it got to the next ad break it was a 3 minutes cycle and in Spanish, so we just gave up watching altogether. Is there a way to at least keep the ads to G-rated ones, preferably in English?</p>\n<p>If I can't disable adult-oriented ads I'll need to disable Plex streaming entirely because of kids watching. The last thing I need is for Plex to show these types of commercials during kids cartoons or similar. Separate profiles are not a viable solution if we're all sitting together and watching something as a family.</p>",

I wanted to practice building Custom GPTs and had a bit of free time. It turned out to be pretty fun to use, especially for quickly finding and adding content. You can even share it with friends or family so they can make requests too.</p>\n<h3>Want to Try It Out?</h3>\n<p>If you already have Plex, Sonarr, Radarr, and Overseerr running, it only takes <strong>5-10 minutes</strong> to set up. You will also need a <strong>ChatGPT Plus subscription</strong>.</p>\n<p>I put together a <a href=\"https://github.com/UnderwaterOverground/Plex-Concierge\">GitHub Repo</a> with the steps and snippets I used for my setup.

I hated the static recomendation rows that plex currently uses so I made this tool to dynamically change the displayed rows. I made a GUI to make it easier to use. I figured there was a good chance someone else would find this useful. Please let me know if there are any features you'd like to see implemented!</p>\n<p>The github readme has a full breakdown of features and screenshots of the GUI. The GUI took me awhile and I wouldn't be shocked if very specific user behavior may cause issues.

I watched it while it was airing but she didn't watch it with me. Fast forward to her being on maternity leave and she wants to watch it now. No problem, let me check my Justwatch app, it's not streaming anywhere. I'll just see if I can find it cheap used somewhere. Nope. For the price difference between new and used, I'll just get it new and use the digital codes for Fandango at home..... the codes are expired and Warner Bros. absolutely refuses to do anything.</p>\n<p>Started watching Westworld, using my Xbox as the player. Audio was desync'd. Bad. I'll just buy a Blu-ray  drive and rip it all. And host it on... </p>\n<p>Research, research research. I'll set up a Plex server (not jellyfin) I had one 10 years ago and I liked it. </p>\n<p>Host it on my PC and quickly fill up half of my 2tb drive. </p>\n<p>Do some more research and decide to build a NAS, I have most of a computer in a box somewhere, so it won't cost me that much. My old i7-6700k, 32gb RAM and a 500gb nvme. Set it up with TrueNAS scale and order a few hdd to get started. </p>\n<p>So now I'm 2 weeks into ripping my 4k collection and adding all the tv shows I like or haven't seen yet, movies that I haven't watched in awhile and cartoons for the kids.</p>\n<p>Now I've bought 4 12TB hddd, used 10TB of my 31TB sthidden (1 drive is for parity), have 6 family/friends that watch my Plex library regularly and have gone down the ARRs rabbit hole. </p>\n<p>Oh yeah, how is Plex ruining my marriage? I've spent so much time and money on this thing that I think she's getting jealous. Lol</p>",

I wasn't thinking about Black Friday discounts, but when I saw some ads for the 25% off I was kicking myself a bit. I thought \"might as well ask if I can get that retroactively applied. Worst they can say is no\". I wrote three sentences explaining what happened yesterday afternoon and this morning I got an email back telling me my Plex Pass has been cancelled and refunded so I can save an extra $30. I wouldn't have thrown a fit if I was told no, but they did a cool thing for me and I want to recognize that. Thanks Plex :)</p>",

So, my question, is there ANY way to get some sort of skeleton file/folder list from PLEX so I can eventually start the process of re-acquiring everything I had? I know I'm probably pissing in the wind here but I thought I'd give it a shot.</p>",

I want to primarily use it as my Plex media server (current Plex media server in second pic)  and possibly game servers like Beamng Drive MP and Assetto Corsa for example. I'm completely new to this sort of setup and don't really know where to start. I'll be putting the server under my house in the garage and I understand that I'll need to run 2 ethernet cables to it. I've heard things like Unraid and dockers are the way to go. Any suggestions or advice on how to get started in setting it up? Thanks in advance \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb</p>",

I dabble in all three and enjoy learning about them. Are there some things that I don't like about Plex? Yes. Are there things other platforms excel at, also yes. Does Plex do most of what Plex enthusiast are here for? Absolutely. But, going in to another subreddit to \"correct\" everyone on their \"ignorance\" or \"sins\" of supporting a platform, whether it's Plex or how you orient your toilet paper, is a bit abrasive. Very few Jellys post anything helpful. Oftentimes it's condescending towards those who are not well versed on networking and home server setups. If users need info on your platform, they will seek you out. Plex users don't post incessantly in the Jellyfin subreddit about it's virtues. No need to badger the ones that enjoy it. Instead offer solutions you found that may translate to solving issues users face with Plex. We CAN coexist peacefully.</p>\n<p>*End Rant* </p>",

A few months ago it was forced arbitration that only had an accept button, next they filed a patent about inserting ads over HDMI, and today they announced video ads on the home screen before anything is selected (see link). I know that the Amazon fire sticks do the same auto play video ads on the screen so that's off the table, so my question is what options do I have for new players that have both wired and wireless network connections that aren't too expensive (Nvidia shield) and will still play most files?</p>\n<p>I'm sad to see the enshitification of Roku.
