Its seriously like pulling teeth, and the Plex application is too stupid to try to \"play at original quality\" when I have transcoding set to \"off\". If the money I spent on a Plexpass could go towards ANYTHING, it would be to have a setting for what my plex clients are forced to \"prefer\" as far as quality.   </p>\n<p>My friends and I all live in good areas of America, not the Congo or somewhere else where internet is just being invented, for the love of god, why does Plex default everyone to 720p@2mbps? I swear, I am going to need to hire someone to make a digital pamphlet on how to get going with Plex, because right now the application makes itself hard for newcomers to use.   </p>\n<p>First, explain what it is, and the benefits. Then, you have to explain how to pin only the good stuff to the lefthand side (vs the bs plex offerings).  </p>\n<p>Then finally, and this is the part that literally takes me months with some of my users, is explaining to them how to not butcher the quality. I'm not even joking that my sysadmin friend, a dude that manages AWS for a living, only FINALLY figured it out this morning (granted, this has a lot to do with head-in-ass syndrome \"but it currently looks <em>fine\"</em>).</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Its not even like my 3950x can't transcode or anything, I dont even see transcoding hit the CPU at all. Its the unrelenting frustration of how Plex handles client player quality, combined with the lackluster UI surrounding it, and the cherry on top is how fucking difficult it is to get each user to make the most out of the software. I swear to god, if I could just push a \"config\" to each client that signs up to use my plex server to have only my \"TV Shows\" and \"Movies\" pinned to the sidebar and the player quality set to original, the software would be perfect, but as its stands now, this is a giant blemish. </p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>And yes, I <em>understand</em> the official reason this is why it is, I just happen to find it complete farcical nonsense that only makes sense if you live in the developing world.</p></div>",

One major focus in this release was an upgrade of some of the core building blocks of the app (<a href=\"https://reactnative.dev\">React Native</a>, <a href=\"https://reactnavigation.org\">React Navigation</a>, and many others). The result is a faster, smoother app, which starts more quickly and transitions more smoothly between screens.</p>\n<p>The other major feature addition is the ability for Plexamp to be remotely controlled. Those with a good memory will remember that the older Plexamp v1 did have this feature, but lost it in the v3 upgrade. Bringing back remote control also unblocks work on a headless version of Plexamp for the Pi, and given that it means bundling a full HTTP server into the app, lots of other innovation is now possible.</p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy this new release, and thank you so much for all the love, helpful bug reports and and great feature suggestions along the way!</p>\n<h3></h3>\n<p><a href=\"#added-2\"></a>Added</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Much faster/smoother navigation.</li>\n<li>Support for being remote controlled.</li>\n<li>Translucent header.</li>\n<li>\u201cReconnect to Players\u201d setting (@C_RRooney).</li>\n<li>iOS: Setting to hide status bar.</li>\n<li>Android: Move to AAudio as default.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3></h3>\n<p><a href=\"#fixed-3\"></a>Fixed</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Respect sort order for library/albums when displaying expanded album view.</li>\n<li>Similar Artists page now uses the grid view.</li>\n<li>Sort Appears On albums by release date.</li>\n<li>Deletion icon in some menus was inconsistent.</li>\n<li>Controlling player streaming from TIDAL didn\u2019t load seekprint.</li>\n<li>Remote TIDAL now playing item could show out of date.</li>\n<li>TIDAL music added to library could play incorrect quality.</li>\n<li>Refresh and shuffle settings weren\u2019t working with remote control.</li>\n<li>Remote control could fail to connect.</li>\n<li>Play queue would not refresh after remote change.</li>\n<li>Repeat all didn\u2019t work with play queues of size one.</li>\n<li>Hitting |&lt; button on first track with repeat on didn\u2019t skip to the last track.</li>\n<li>Repeating offline shuffled play queues didn\u2019t always work.</li>\n<li>In some cases, AutoPlay didn\u2019t work at the end of a playlist.</li>\n<li>In light themes, music skip icons were the wrong color.</li>\n<li>Style/genre album counts could be incorrect.</li>\n<li>Incorrect margins switching between list and grid views.</li>\n<li>Crash initializing audio.</li>\n<li>Collections view could browse to the wrong collection in some cases (thanks <a href=\"/u/owen\">@Owen</a> R).</li>\n<li>Extreme memory usage with high resolution PNG posters.</li>\n<li>Opus albums wouldn\u2019t show bitrate.</li>\n<li>Improve sign-in screen field suggestions.</li>\n<li>Android: Double-tapping headphone button to skip could result in playback pausing (thanks to <a href=\"/u/doctorzeromd\">@doctorzeromd</a>).</li>\n<li>Android: Google Assistant driving mode could not browse the library.</li>\n<li>Android: Remove \u201chide status bar\u201d setting (for now, at least).</li>\n<li>iOS: Shuffle mode was toggled incorrectly in some cases.</li>\n<li>iOS: Slide Over player layout on some iPads.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Source: https://forums.plex.tv/t/221280/38</p></div>",

I always thought that using the web version through the media server was the only way to watch stuff but apparently there's a stand-alone mediaplayer too. Thanks to this reddit I discovered it and I'm gonna for sure test out if it's any better because I've been having some playback issues lately that weren't that bad but just a bit annoying.</p>\n<p>ANYWAY. Now I'm wondering... what else have I been missing all these years? What are things that I should for sure know about? :)</p>\n<p>ps. been using Plex on my Samsung TV too, just need to move it to my new place to get it back up and running.</p></div>",

After spending considerable money on new plex players (from a Flagship Samsung TV, to breaking down and buying an nVidia Shield Pro), and rebuilding and reconfiguring my Plex server, nothing significantly improved the issue.</p>\n<p>Just the other day, I was trying my hand at this again and while watching the live system monitoring on my router noticed that it would spike to 80-90Mbps during streaming, then drop to 10Mbps for at least a minute, and then spike to 80 again and playback would resume.Something clicked and I put my hand on the router and it was HOT. So I got a CPU fan with a thermostat controller and set it up to blow over the router when the probe (on the bottom of the router) exceeded 32C and turn off when it cooled to 30C. I can now stream even the highest bitrate 4K HDR videos in my collection for hours on end, only occasionally experiencing a short buffering blip!</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Edit since there are a few sour patch dorks replying: I have a Unifi USG-3P router, that also runs a VPN tunnel to my colocation network (plex streams outside of the tunnel) so it does have more processing going on than the supported configuration. It also is sitting on top of a hot Cisco fanless L3 switch, so there's more factors than just bad hardware. The moral of the story, is make sure your router has good ventilation where ever it is, and augment it with a fan if necessary.<br />\nIt's not a crappy Netgear router, but it also relies on passive cooling from the ambient air so this can still be useful for other residential routers people likely have.</p></div>",

I bought a synology nas after going back and forth for over a year about it and I just did a huge amount of work today getting plex set up locally, remote and transferring about 5k songs and 20 movies.  All this data was on a 10yr old WD 1tb external HD and mixed between laptops and such.  I've been spending years transferring these songs from place to place but have never been able to actually use them and never had a reason to properly organize it.  I'm over the moon right now!  </p>\n<p>As the title says, I definitely ran into some problems but between searching the different reddit forums I was able to solve everything.  You guys really created a huge bank of knowledge in answering all these questions. </p>\n<p>So here's a big thank you and kudos from me and all the other people who know how to use the search function \ud83e\udd23</p>\n<p>Next step is taking the old VHS home videos and getting them on plex.  </p>\n<p>Hopefully this is OK per the rules.  A little in jest about searching and appreciation for you guys.</p></div>",

It also tells me about streams and bandwith too! </p>\n<p>Beneath that are my various queues, and beneath that is a little way to see the status of each service I'm running - a green light means it's all good and working properly!</p>\n<p>Lastly I have some average speedtest data (yay for slow Australian internet :( ), and the calendar so I know when things are coming out!</p>\n<p>It was definitely very satisfying getting it all working together, so I hope you like it too!</p>\n<p>Does anyone else have their own dashboards they want to share? Now that it's all done, I want to add more stuff, but can't think of anything else to add :P!</p></div>",

My CPU is strong enough to serve dozens of original quality streams, as is my network. Why isn't the default for clients to be using the original quality, with it only lowering if their network can't handle it?</p>\n<p>Clients should be assumed to be lazy and do not want to fiddle with settings. I don't want my clients to have an inferior experience. I don't want them to tell me \"i tried plex , but the quality wasnt good so I went back to Netflix\".</p>\n<p>And you can't keep reaching out to people, because they think its creepy that you're always seeing what they watch.</p>\n<p>edit: Please don't comment saying you desire your clients to have a 720p limit. You can set whatever arbitrary limit you want already through the server settings. Im just asking for the ability to also set a default value for clients (that they can freely change to whatever they want)</p></div>",
