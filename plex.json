I am currently storing and hosting Plex on a Synology 923+ (so no hardware transcoding). This is fine most of the time. Me and 4 remote users all direct play on their home internet. </p>\n<p>I am helping someone replace their graphics card and power supply, so he is letting me buy his 1650 Super and 500W PSU for $50 (heyooo). From NVIDIA's chart, I saw that the 1650S should be able to transcode three 4K HDR HEVC streams. So the idea is to just complete the rest of a computer that can transcode my library and host my PMS. But what CPU should I use to power everything EXCEPT transcoding? Trying to use basically as little money as possible. </p>\n<p>CPU:?\nMobo:?\nRAM: any 2x8 DDR4\nGPU: 1650 Super\nStorage: 240GB Kingston SSD\nPSU: EVGA 500W White</p></div>",

Which is totally untrue.</p>\n<p>I do have a fairly large library (\\~10TB) ... on a 10 yo Synology NAS and plex on a HP promini desktop pc with an I3, I was proud when I tested that it could manage 3 concurrent streams xD</p>\n<p>My library was shared with friends an family and all of them got an email stating that I've been profiting from this, most of them sent me a message asking what did I do and if I was ok ( xD)</p>\n<p>It is pretty infuriating that plex automatically suspends accounts without any advice, sending all contacts a notification like this. And I am sure this is automated and there is no human checking the activity of my library, as it is pretty low (maybe 10 streams a week at most, many weeks it is totally unused) and the hardware is totally unprepared to serve many users.</p>\n<p>And to top it all this is just a few months after I paid a lifetime subscription xD</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>I'd love to go back in time, delete plex and go to any open source alternative.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Edit: spelling, clarification</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Update: Plex has restored my account via email :)</p></div>",

Once I told them it was a server issue, they all started offering to help pay for any repairs necessary (which I turned down because I don't want to take money) and the tech-minded ones were offering troubleshooting assistance.

My collection even further back(XBMC). I painstakingly go through the posters and cover art to make sure they are nice. I update files to better quality ones to keep up with better displays. Add interesting content as I find it. Content from multiple decades(1970s-current). You all know the drill.</p>\n<p>So with upgraded internet connection, I can finally start to watch Plex outside of my home. It is a burden of living well into the country side(services lag behind). So my wife offers one of her friends access to Plex. I don't take issue with it. In all honesty, I didn't mind load testing it. I wanted to experiment.</p>\n<p>This woman has watched Jaws 21 times in 30 days. I can't wrap my head around that. I like certain movies as well but damn not that much.</p></div>",

We immediately began an investigation and it does appear that a third-party was able to access a limited subset of data that includes emails, usernames, and encrypted passwords. Even though all account passwords that could have been accessed were hashed and secured in accordance with best practices, out of an abundance of caution we are requiring all Plex accounts to have their password reset.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So were these passwords encrypted, in which case they could be decrypted if the adversary got the key, or hashed? Hashed passwords leaking would be much less of an issue.</p>\n<p>Edit: Encryption and hashing is <strong>not</strong> the same thing.</p>\n<p>Edit2: Passwords were hashed with salt, not encrypted (<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/PleX/comments/wwb8uy/plex_breached_were_passwords_encrypted_or_hashed/ilkbawb/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3\">see this comment</a>)</p>\n<p>Edit3: Just for clarity this is the best case scenario. It\u2019s difficult to reverse hashed passwords unless they are very simple. Plex got the word out quickly so we have plenty of time to change our passwords. Kudos!</p>\n<p>This is why you never reuse password, use a password manager and enable 2fa wherever you can. :)</p></div>",

That's why I go through the trouble of configuring it. </p>\n<p>The truth is that, if I wanted to, I could just make a UPnP server and tell people to use BubbleUPnP and stuff . And it would basically work. <em>I</em> know I could definitely use it to play stuff from my tablet or TV. But the problem is my parents. I'd like them to use my content as well, and they constantly use it. And that's the whole reason I am using Plex, because it similar to playing stuff from other streaming sites.</p>\n<p>I am not opposed to Plex investing dev time in weird features or in trying to monetize in additional ways. But these changes shouldn't come in detriment of Plex's main job. And making the main page so complicated to use, telling users to use 'Discover' . Filling things up with 'Live TV' from weird internet channels. It's a lot of pollution. It's worse when these changes can happen overnight. If my parents are used to one UI and it suddenly changes and they need my in-person assistance to reorder the home page, then Plex has failed to do its main job. If it becomes harder to find my content, then plex has failed to do its main job.</p></div>",
