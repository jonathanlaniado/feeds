I want to primarily use it as my Plex media server (current Plex media server in second pic)  and possibly game servers like Beamng Drive MP and Assetto Corsa for example. I'm completely new to this sort of setup and don't really know where to start. I'll be putting the server under my house in the garage and I understand that I'll need to run 2 ethernet cables to it. I've heard things like Unraid and dockers are the way to go. Any suggestions or advice on how to get started in setting it up? Thanks in advance \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb</p>",

I dabble in all three and enjoy learning about them. Are there some things that I don't like about Plex? Yes. Are there things other platforms excel at, also yes. Does Plex do most of what Plex enthusiast are here for? Absolutely. But, going in to another subreddit to \"correct\" everyone on their \"ignorance\" or \"sins\" of supporting a platform, whether it's Plex or how you orient your toilet paper, is a bit abrasive. Very few Jellys post anything helpful. Oftentimes it's condescending towards those who are not well versed on networking and home server setups. If users need info on your platform, they will seek you out. Plex users don't post incessantly in the Jellyfin subreddit about it's virtues. No need to badger the ones that enjoy it. Instead offer solutions you found that may translate to solving issues users face with Plex. We CAN coexist peacefully.</p>\n<p>*End Rant* </p>",

A few months ago it was forced arbitration that only had an accept button, next they filed a patent about inserting ads over HDMI, and today they announced video ads on the home screen before anything is selected (see link). I know that the Amazon fire sticks do the same auto play video ads on the screen so that's off the table, so my question is what options do I have for new players that have both wired and wireless network connections that aren't too expensive (Nvidia shield) and will still play most files?</p>\n<p>I'm sad to see the enshitification of Roku.

Like many of you, I have contributed hours/years of meticulously organizing, tagging, curating and designing posters, etc., and at some point, it might not be something we can pass down (compared to a DVD collection that might end up at a yard sale), it might just go poof. So curious if anyone has a plan, and if so, share details so we can all learn. Because it\u2019s definitely worth passing down but doubtful my SO or kids could even fathom what to do with it.</p>",

So as part of my troubleshooting process, I downloaded both Emby and Jellyfin in an attempt to see whether the issue was Plex or some other part of my system (the issue ended up being something unrelated to Plex).</p>\n<p>All I can say is, wow, Plex is way ahead of the others from what little I saw. I have heard time and time again that Emby and/or Jellyfin are better for x, y, or z reasons, but that was not my experience at all. Both of them organized my libraries horrendously, where Plex handles them like a champ. Sometimes even Plex fumbles the ball a little, but never have I seen such a disorganized mess than I did on those other platforms. </p>\n<p>Maybe it's too harsh to fault the others for poor library organization, but IMO that's a huge part of the experience of watching your content. If you can't even find the show or movie you want to watch from your library, what's even the point? </p>\n<p>I do hope the others can catch up to Plex, because we need good competition in this space. I don't want to feel like Plex is the only good option. But based on my experience the last couple of days, they have some work to do.</p>",

It is the first streaming device to fully support all DV profiles just like a physical UHD player (eg UB820). Kodi add-ons like Plex install as usual. TrueHD and DTS audio are also supported. Buy the Ugoos AM6b+, load up CoreElec onto a microSD card, install the Plex add-on and enjoy. I've completely replaced my Shield Pro 2019 last week and DV remuxes have never looked better.</p>\n<p>Long answer:</p>\n<p>For those that don't know, there is an open source project called \"CoreElec\". The goal of this project was to run Kodi natively on Linux. It is now very mature and about a year ago, the CoreElec team obtained Dolby certification for 2x \"generic\" Android TV streaming boxes. They are the Ugoos AM6b+ and the Minix U22X-J. Since then they've been hard a work adding Dolby Vision playback to the above 2x players.</p>\n<p>The CoreElec team has announced 2x weeks ago that their newest stable release fully plays back ALL Dolby Vision profiles, including P7 FEL flawlessly. These streaming boxes also handle both TrueHD and DTS codecs providing for an ideal Plex/remux experience.</p>\n<p>I personally tested the latest CoreElec release on the Ugoos AM6b+ and it is amazing. Plex is installed onto Kodi via PlexMod4Kodi. No issues playing back any native DV remuxes or hybrid DV remuxes. Support for all lossless audio as well as passthrough. SDR/HDR content plays back as usual.</p>\n<p>This is extremely exciting since this is the first time any streaming player can handle both Plex and P7 FEL marking an significant improvement onto the Shield Pro. </p>\n<p>Most people here won't care. But if you collect remuxes and have a DV enabled panel, upgrading to the Ugoos AM6b+ with CoreElec is - imo - mandatory.</p>",

Around 60TB library. </p>\n<p>It has worked great for me and my family until last week I started upgrading media to 4k and now CPU is always 90-100% and yesterday only 2 users where watching and Plex was doing some media work in the background resulting in errors for viewer that movie stopped and they could not reach the server. </p>\n<p>Ideally I want to be able to have 5-8 connections at the same time. What GPU do I need for that? </p>\n<p>I currently have I7-2600 and 16gb RAM and no GPU. Advise needed.</p>",

I've struggled with getting GPU hardware transcoding working, despite the fact that I seemingly met all the requirements. I thought maybe my \"older\" nvidia card's GPU core was to blame and recently updated to a 1660S with no appreciable improvement. I saw .5x transcoding for DoVi/HDR content with tone mapping, or ~1-2x if I disabled tone mapping.</p>\n<p>Banging my head against the wall, I came to realize I WAS STILL RUNNING 32 BIT PLEX. I had installed server SO LONG AGO that I never upgraded to 64 bit.</p>\n<p>Upgrading to 64 bit was the single most absurd performance improvement for server I've ever seen. I am now able to transcode 4K DoVi/HDR with tone mapping so fast that Plex is throttling (taking a break). My GPU use during transcodes went from 10-20% to 95%+.</p>\n<p>Yes, I know, don't transcode - in my home I run multiple Shields. But sometimes on the road that isn't an option. It's kind of wild to me my server never nudged me to see if I wanted to bump to 64.</p>\n<p><strong>How to check and upgrade (Windows)</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Open Task Manager</li>\n<li>Go to Details</li>\n<li>Right click on the top bar -&gt; Select Columns</li>\n<li>Check \"Platform\"</li>\n<li>Find Plex in the list - is it 32 bit?</li>\n<li>If so, go download server again and choose the 64 bit option.</li>\n<li>Run the installer; it will detect you are on 32 and uninstall/upgrade while maintaining all of your settings.</li>\n</ul>",
