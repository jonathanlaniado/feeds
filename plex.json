We immediately began an investigation and it does appear that a third-party was able to access a limited subset of data that includes emails, usernames, and encrypted passwords. Even though all account passwords that could have been accessed were hashed and secured in accordance with best practices, out of an abundance of caution we are requiring all Plex accounts to have their password reset.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So were these passwords encrypted, in which case they could be decrypted if the adversary got the key, or hashed? Hashed passwords leaking would be much less of an issue.</p>\n<p>Edit: Encryption and hashing is <strong>not</strong> the same thing.</p>\n<p>Edit2: Passwords were hashed with salt, not encrypted (<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/PleX/comments/wwb8uy/plex_breached_were_passwords_encrypted_or_hashed/ilkbawb/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3\">see this comment</a>)</p>\n<p>Edit3: Just for clarity this is the best case scenario. It\u2019s difficult to reverse hashed passwords unless they are very simple. Plex got the word out quickly so we have plenty of time to change our passwords. Kudos!</p>\n<p>This is why you never reuse password, use a password manager and enable 2fa wherever you can. :)</p></div>",

Filling things up with 'Live TV' from weird internet channels. It's a lot of pollution. It's worse when these changes can happen overnight.

Now it seems we're going in the opposite directions, specifically:</p>\n<p>1) There's a maybe 40% chance I can't play any given file on my Plex Apple TV client connected to a 1080P TV. Either no audio, or it dies a few moments into the video. I've tried all manner of streaming settings and often get the same effect on another Apple TV 4K connected to a 4K projector. The same files will play just fine on Infuse. I'll occasionally check the Plex forums and there's all manner of settings tweaks that don't quite work, and then someone swoops in and blames AppleTV, which might make sense if Infuse didn't work perfectly.</p>\n<p>2) The \"much better than the old sync\" Download feature on iOS is hot garbage. I've started traveling again and find this hugely frustrating. With the old sync feature I could flag 1-6 shows or movies before I went to bed, everything would transcode on the server overnight, and in the AM I could sync hours of content flawlessly in maybe 20 minutes over WiFi. With Downloads I'm lucky if I can get a 2 episodes of a single show and that's if I leave the iPad on, with Plex open, and babysit the thing.</p>\n<p>I get it that Plex wants to become a super-cool streaming company and do an IPO and be like Netflix Jr. and fly around on the G6 and do lines off Vegan Leather seats like the WeWork guy, but can we just get the basics of playing local media perfect before we launch crappy Live TV or allow me to search Netflix without using Netflix?!?!</p></div>",

Then about a year ago one of my friends said nothing works anymore. I went through all kinds of trouble shooting and even drove over to his house one time and got it working by cranking the quality way down (480p). He said after a while even that had to stop and buffer though so he gave up and just bought Netflix. Fast forward to a month ago, I set up my girlfriend on Plex but she has the same issues. I then realise they are the only ones on the same ISP. I reach out to a buddy whose partner just so happens to be high level at that ISP. And just last week they got back to me saying they have flagged it as pirating software and anything being sent through that will be throttled way down because of this.\nI'm getting them to set up a VPN to be able to use Plex. Just thought I would let people on here know that if Plex gets flagged and throttled by more and more ISPs this could be an issue for more.</p>\n<p>The ISP is Bell MTS</p>\n<p>Edit: Thanks guys, I'll try to switch the Port tonight and report back if that works!</p></div>",

Its seriously like pulling teeth, and the Plex application is too stupid to try to \"play at original quality\" when I have transcoding set to \"off\". If the money I spent on a Plexpass could go towards ANYTHING, it would be to have a setting for what my plex clients are forced to \"prefer\" as far as quality.   </p>\n<p>My friends and I all live in good areas of America, not the Congo or somewhere else where internet is just being invented, for the love of god, why does Plex default everyone to 720p@2mbps? I swear, I am going to need to hire someone to make a digital pamphlet on how to get going with Plex, because right now the application makes itself hard for newcomers to use.   </p>\n<p>First, explain what it is, and the benefits. Then, you have to explain how to pin only the good stuff to the lefthand side (vs the bs plex offerings).  </p>\n<p>Then finally, and this is the part that literally takes me months with some of my users, is explaining to them how to not butcher the quality. I'm not even joking that my sysadmin friend, a dude that manages AWS for a living, only FINALLY figured it out this morning (granted, this has a lot to do with head-in-ass syndrome \"but it currently looks <em>fine\"</em>).</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Its not even like my 3950x can't transcode or anything, I dont even see transcoding hit the CPU at all. Its the unrelenting frustration of how Plex handles client player quality, combined with the lackluster UI surrounding it, and the cherry on top is how fucking difficult it is to get each user to make the most out of the software. I swear to god, if I could just push a \"config\" to each client that signs up to use my plex server to have only my \"TV Shows\" and \"Movies\" pinned to the sidebar and the player quality set to original, the software would be perfect, but as its stands now, this is a giant blemish. </p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>And yes, I <em>understand</em> the official reason this is why it is, I just happen to find it complete farcical nonsense that only makes sense if you live in the developing world.</p></div>",

One major focus in this release was an upgrade of some of the core building blocks of the app (<a href=\"https://reactnative.dev\">React Native</a>, <a href=\"https://reactnavigation.org\">React Navigation</a>, and many others). The result is a faster, smoother app, which starts more quickly and transitions more smoothly between screens.</p>\n<p>The other major feature addition is the ability for Plexamp to be remotely controlled. Those with a good memory will remember that the older Plexamp v1 did have this feature, but lost it in the v3 upgrade. Bringing back remote control also unblocks work on a headless version of Plexamp for the Pi, and given that it means bundling a full HTTP server into the app, lots of other innovation is now possible.</p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy this new release, and thank you so much for all the love, helpful bug reports and and great feature suggestions along the way!</p>\n<h3></h3>\n<p><a href=\"#added-2\"></a>Added</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Much faster/smoother navigation.</li>\n<li>Support for being remote controlled.</li>\n<li>Translucent header.</li>\n<li>\u201cReconnect to Players\u201d setting (@C_RRooney).</li>\n<li>iOS: Setting to hide status bar.</li>\n<li>Android: Move to AAudio as default.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3></h3>\n<p><a href=\"#fixed-3\"></a>Fixed</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Respect sort order for library/albums when displaying expanded album view.</li>\n<li>Similar Artists page now uses the grid view.</li>\n<li>Sort Appears On albums by release date.</li>\n<li>Deletion icon in some menus was inconsistent.</li>\n<li>Controlling player streaming from TIDAL didn\u2019t load seekprint.</li>\n<li>Remote TIDAL now playing item could show out of date.</li>\n<li>TIDAL music added to library could play incorrect quality.</li>\n<li>Refresh and shuffle settings weren\u2019t working with remote control.</li>\n<li>Remote control could fail to connect.</li>\n<li>Play queue would not refresh after remote change.</li>\n<li>Repeat all didn\u2019t work with play queues of size one.</li>\n<li>Hitting |&lt; button on first track with repeat on didn\u2019t skip to the last track.</li>\n<li>Repeating offline shuffled play queues didn\u2019t always work.</li>\n<li>In some cases, AutoPlay didn\u2019t work at the end of a playlist.</li>\n<li>In light themes, music skip icons were the wrong color.</li>\n<li>Style/genre album counts could be incorrect.</li>\n<li>Incorrect margins switching between list and grid views.</li>\n<li>Crash initializing audio.</li>\n<li>Collections view could browse to the wrong collection in some cases (thanks <a href=\"/u/owen\">@Owen</a> R).</li>\n<li>Extreme memory usage with high resolution PNG posters.</li>\n<li>Opus albums wouldn\u2019t show bitrate.</li>\n<li>Improve sign-in screen field suggestions.</li>\n<li>Android: Double-tapping headphone button to skip could result in playback pausing (thanks to <a href=\"/u/doctorzeromd\">@doctorzeromd</a>).</li>\n<li>Android: Google Assistant driving mode could not browse the library.</li>\n<li>Android: Remove \u201chide status bar\u201d setting (for now, at least).</li>\n<li>iOS: Shuffle mode was toggled incorrectly in some cases.</li>\n<li>iOS: Slide Over player layout on some iPads.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Source: https://forums.plex.tv/t/221280/38</p></div>",

A few DMs later and everything was running just like it would have been had I followed his instructions properly in the first place!</p>\n<p>So Chuck, Thank You!</p>\n<p>Plex is one of the best media management products I\u2019ve found and recommend it to anyone who asks.

I always thought that using the web version through the media server was the only way to watch stuff but apparently there's a stand-alone mediaplayer too. Thanks to this reddit I discovered it and I'm gonna for sure test out if it's any better because I've been having some playback issues lately that weren't that bad but just a bit annoying.</p>\n<p>ANYWAY. Now I'm wondering... what else have I been missing all these years? What are things that I should for sure know about? :)</p>\n<p>ps. been using Plex on my Samsung TV too, just need to move it to my new place to get it back up and running.</p></div>",
