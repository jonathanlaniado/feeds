The guesses have ranged from instant messaging to integration with the Cron calendar, and even the long-awaited offline mode ...</p>\n<p>However, Notion seems to have accidentally revealed what it will be. Today, a banner briefly appeared at the top of the Notion website:</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/seg94erzgibc1.jpg?width=3810&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69986e21d315d6b441ae2cf8873175ad9c8e5f64</p>\n<p>Shortly after, the banner was removed. So, we can look forward to a calendar integration! Whether it will be the integration of Cron remains to be seen. Cron is a separate calendar app that Notion acquired two years ago and can also manage data from Google Calendar. Through Cron, it would be possible to integrate Google Calendar into Notion.</p>\n<p>However, the banner does not mention Cron and instead refers to a \"Notion Calendar\". This could indicate a new native calendar functionality in Notion, independent of Cron.</p>\n<p>We don't know the details yet, but the anticipation is high since calendar functionality was certainly one of the most requested features by users \u2013 just behind offline mode... \ud83d\ude09</p>",

Does the lack of an offline mode bother you? </p>\n<p>Upon reflecting on this, it seems I have internet access 99% of the time when I want to access my notes, despite travelling a lot. But sometimes the connection is bad in a foreign country or when driving on a highway in the mountains, when I want to quickly check a note about local restaurants that I have taken notes on. I can imagine there could be occasions in the future, say, if I want to do some focused writing in a remote location where internet is unreliable.</p>\n<p>Please don't recommend local first alternatives. I absolutely need to have web access to my notes when I'm on a work computer.</p>",

Would it be possible for someone to aid me in setting up a KPI system so that it has a Log Interface that I use to log certain numbers, it updates the KPIs, and it shows me a progress bar as well as an on-track status for each KPI? I also need it to update every week and store the previous week's KPIs in an archive or Log. Something like the picture below. I know I have to link databases, have one database look up results from another, and all three aspects will probably be a database (Logging interface, actual KPI view, and archive). I looked at all the videos I could find, and I think <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyUhQFobvU0&amp;t=12s\">something similar to this video came closest</a> to what I wanted. </p>\n<p>I also need to feed some of the results (like sales, expenses, etc) into another, overall KPI board of my agency. But I guess that's something I could just do with sums and references. </p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/vyu38lpr9ltb1.png?width=1254&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c2faff3224576a968566e58637b9868f2ad51e5</p>\n<p>No need to give me an entire solution, only looking for tips that could help me along the way. Thank you very much!!! </p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Any templates, courses, solutions, suggestions, external tools I need - not a problem. I'll buy them and learn. But I need to get this done. Thanks!! </p>",
