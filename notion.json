For me it would be the loading times. By the time notion is up I've already forgotten what I was thinking about, making it unsuitable for capturing thoughts and ideas on the go. I also feel like notion is almost too flexible, like it can do almost anything but then because of that you have to spend a lot of time maintaining and organizing. I love all the markdown features though.</p></div>",
