I\u2019ve tried a bunch of apps and websites, but I haven\u2019t found one that has everything I need. It\u2019s been a bit overwhelming, so I thought I\u2019d reach out here for some recommendations. Thanks in advance!</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s what I\u2019m hoping to find:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Task Breakdown:</strong>\u00a0I need a way to split projects into smaller, manageable tasks or subcategories.</li>\n<li><strong>Progress Insights:</strong>\u00a0It would be great if the tool has features to analyze how I spend my time or track my habits.</li>\n<li><strong>Preferred Timing:</strong>\u00a0A feature to specify the best times for completing tasks would be super helpful.</li>\n<li><strong>Focus Sessions:</strong>\u00a0I\u2019d appreciate a way to schedule dedicated focus periods for specific tasks.</li>\n<li><strong>Recurring Task Scheduler:</strong>\u00a0I\u2019d love to set up and manage tasks that repeat regularly.</li>\n<li><strong>Smart Scheduling:</strong>\u00a0An AI-driven planner would be a huge bonus!</li>\n<li><strong>Flexible Deadlines:</strong>\u00a0I need a tool that can manage tasks with varying deadlines.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So far, I\u2019ve checked out the following apps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://Sunsama.com\">Sunsama</a><strong>:</strong>\u00a0It helps with task breakdowns and has some tracking features, but it\u2019s missing a perfect to do list.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://Cerefine.com\">Cerefine</a><strong>:</strong>\u00a0I\u2019ve just started using it, and it seems to check off a lot of my boxes. To-do list, habit tracking, and focus sessions. I\u2019d love to hear if anyone else has experience with it!</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://Notion.com\">Notion</a><strong>:</strong>\u00a0I like its flexibility, but it can be overwhelming. The complex interface, information overload, and numerous features can make it hard to stay organized.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://Omnifocus.com\">Omnifocus</a><strong>:</strong>\u00a0I like that it allows for detailed task management, but the lack of a web version is a downside.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://Asana.com\">Asana</a><strong>:</strong>\u00a0Good for organizing tasks and tracking progress, but it doesn\u2019t have features for recurring tasks.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://Skedpal.com\">Skedpal</a><strong>:</strong>\u00a0I found it helpful for scheduling tasks at specific times, but I\u2019m looking for something with more features.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If anyone has any suggestions or knows of tools that fit these needs, I would really appreciate it!</p>",

For that reason, the companies where I believe I could add the most value are the companies with products that I love, use the most, and recommend to others \u2014 Notion is at the top of that list.</p>\n<p>I have worked long hours for most of my career in hopes that I could learn skills across all functions of a business at an accelerated rate compared to a typical 9-5pm schedule. I started as a financial <strong>consultant</strong> (working with the largest financial institutions in the world like <strong>Bank of America &amp; TD Bank</strong>), then worked for a high-growth midmarket company (<a href=\"http://www.lemonade.com\"><strong>Lemonade</strong></a> insurance), and have spent most of the last 5 years as an early employee for growth stage VC-backed startups (<a href=\"http://www.knoetic.com\"><strong>Knoetic</strong></a>, <a href=\"http://www.thirdwork.xyz\"><strong>Thirdwork</strong></a>).</p>\n<p><strong>I have diverse experience problem-solving and pattern matching across operations, BD, and product, but at a high level consider my greatest strengths to be:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>1.</em> <strong><em>Being the interface between technical and business functions:</em></strong> <em>Starting my career as a backend engineer allows me to dig deep with data/eng teams, then condense complicated topics in a digestible way to the rest of the org</em></p>\n<p><em>2.</em> <strong><em>Relationship building</em></strong>: I grew <a href=\"http://www.thirdwork.xyz\"><strong><em>Thirdwork</em></strong></a> <em>from $0 - 800k in annualized revenue selling to early-stage and midmarket founders / executives, and led Sales &amp; Customer Success at</em> <a href=\"http://www.knoetic.com\"><strong><em>Knoetic</em></strong></a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>I have applied to multiple different roles at Notion over the last few months + sent personalized outreach to hiring managers in hopes of getting noticed, but I\u2019m sure Notion is receiving A LOT of applications for each job req\u2026If anyone has any suggestions on how to break through, I\u2019d love to hear them!</em> \ud83d\ude4f</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/19tU0KdLHRzisKIEZd1dHkTITazAnmL9P/view?usp=sharing\"><strong>My Resume</strong></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffwinkle/\"><strong>My LinkedIn</strong></a></p>\n<p>\u270c\ufe0f Jeff</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/ph4k31heg9kd1.jpg?width=400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b5b44078e740f5e91c9ed436ee0495f33822b75f</p>",

Been trying to use it since it first came out because it really really really looks good from far as the ultimate solution for organizing yourself, but I have come to the conclusion that this tool does, at least for me, more harm than good.</p>\n<p>Let's go over what my point is and what I am trying to get across:</p>\n<p>Jack of all and master of none. Most of the built-in tools that it provides are a half-assed version of what you could get from a tool that does only that certain thing. Let's go over some examples.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Need a database? Airtable is a better tool and offers a free plan</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Need to write down notes? Apple Notes, Google Keep, and Evernote(Free version or paid) are better and work offline</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Need to track habits? Notion is horrible for that. Use an actual habit tracker like Looper or other free tools so that the functionality is built in and you do not have to manually reset everything or have one built out that </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tracking todos? If you are tracking stuff for work that has to be tracked and done on time and not for <strong>\"aesthetic\"</strong> reasons then use a tool like Todoist or Asana. Both offer free versions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Wiki software? If you are using it personally, sorry but those fall under the notes category. If it is for a business then you should either be hosting it on your own as a DokuWiki or using something like confluence which is free for up to 10 users, BUT I can see just in this use case how notion helps.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Outlining? This is what brought me to Nion in the first place. I thought it was a better version of Workflowy, but it is not. Workflowy and Dynalist do a much better job of outlines.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Project management? I mean c'mon folks. If you take your business seriously then you should use something like Trello, Basecamp, Asana, and Monday. The list goes on and on and there are industry-specific tools for you that I have not mentioned.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I can't think of any single use case where Notion does something better than a tool that was built for that specific purpose and find myself going back to other tools and having to run back and forth between something that doesn't work and something that does.</p>\n<p>Notion has become a way for people to make extra money selling templates for things that you don't need, don't use, and won't make you more productive; because at the end of the day, the only reason to be using notion is for productivity. It reminds me of the aisle in Staples and Office Depot that sells daily planners that have designs on them and people only buy them because they <strong>look</strong> good. If it will not make you more productive, then you are using it as a toy and not as a tool.</p>\n<p>The real winners here are people who made businesses out of selling you a template for something that can be bought off the shelf and work better. Just feels really scammy.</p>\n<p>I don't want to shit on the developers because they have made a great product, but it feels like they have lost their core competency on what they are trying to build and are adding on features for a user base that will grow up and move on to big-boy tools. It seems like what they are making right now is for children and not professionals. Sorry for venting but this is just my opinion and hopefully it will help people who are having issues with using Notion to get things done because that's what really matters.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Later.</em></strong></p>",

The guesses have ranged from instant messaging to integration with the Cron calendar, and even the long-awaited offline mode ...</p>\n<p>However, Notion seems to have accidentally revealed what it will be. Today, a banner briefly appeared at the top of the Notion website:</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/seg94erzgibc1.jpg?width=3810&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69986e21d315d6b441ae2cf8873175ad9c8e5f64</p>\n<p>Shortly after, the banner was removed. So, we can look forward to a calendar integration! Whether it will be the integration of Cron remains to be seen. Cron is a separate calendar app that Notion acquired two years ago and can also manage data from Google Calendar. Through Cron, it would be possible to integrate Google Calendar into Notion.</p>\n<p>However, the banner does not mention Cron and instead refers to a \"Notion Calendar\". This could indicate a new native calendar functionality in Notion, independent of Cron.</p>\n<p>We don't know the details yet, but the anticipation is high since calendar functionality was certainly one of the most requested features by users \u2013 just behind offline mode... \ud83d\ude09</p>",

I can imagine there could be occasions in the future, say, if I want to do some focused writing in a remote location where internet is unreliable.</p>\n<p>Please don't recommend local first alternatives. I absolutely need to have web access to my notes when I'm on a work computer.</p>",

I've evolved it into some kind of Avatar: The Last Airbender theme because it resonates with me. In the end, I decided not to make a sort of RPG store/market, it just seemed unnecessary for my purposes.

Would it be possible for someone to aid me in setting up a KPI system so that it has a Log Interface that I use to log certain numbers, it updates the KPIs, and it shows me a progress bar as well as an on-track status for each KPI? I also need it to update every week and store the previous week's KPIs in an archive or Log. Something like the picture below. I know I have to link databases, have one database look up results from another, and all three aspects will probably be a database (Logging interface, actual KPI view, and archive). I looked at all the videos I could find, and I think <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyUhQFobvU0&amp;t=12s\">something similar to this video came closest</a> to what I wanted. </p>\n<p>I also need to feed some of the results (like sales, expenses, etc) into another, overall KPI board of my agency. But I guess that's something I could just do with sums and references. </p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/vyu38lpr9ltb1.png?width=1254&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c2faff3224576a968566e58637b9868f2ad51e5</p>\n<p>No need to give me an entire solution, only looking for tips that could help me along the way. Thank you very much!!! </p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Any templates, courses, solutions, suggestions, external tools I need - not a problem. I'll buy them and learn. But I need to get this done. Thanks!! </p>",

I've been diving deep into Notion for the past few years, and I'm continually amazed by its capabilities.</p>\n<p>I've seen many of you incorporate widgets to enhance the functionality and aesthetics of your Notion pages. This got me thinking: Why not design some fresh, free widgets for our community?</p>\n<p>Right now, I'm considering developing widgets like a habit tracker, mood tracker, and perhaps a water intake tracker.</p>\n<p>Got any widget ideas or suggestions? Drop them in the comments below! And if you're passionate about this and think you can add value to the project, slide into my DMs. Let's collaborate and bring something new to the Notion community!</p></div>",

For me it would be the loading times. By the time notion is up I've already forgotten what I was thinking about, making it unsuitable for capturing thoughts and ideas on the go. I also feel like notion is almost too flexible, like it can do almost anything but then because of that you have to spend a lot of time maintaining and organizing. I love all the markdown features though.</p></div>",
