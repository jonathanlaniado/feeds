This one may sound obvious but we now added support for 50 countries\n- While we support on-site and hybrid roles, we work best for remote jobs!</p>\n<p>Our Mission is to Level the playing field by targeting roles that match your skills and experience, no spray-and-pray.</p>\n<p>Feel free to use it right away, SimpleApply is live for everyone.

Nothing stuck. Broken code, weird bugs, and now I\u2019m 99% confused and 100% committed. Burnout hit fast.</p>\n<p>So I walked away. Shut it down.</p>\n<h1>Then One Day\u2026 I Tried Again</h1>\n<p>Something pulled me back \u2014 maybe stubbornness, maybe caffeine. Either way, I gave it another shot. But this time, I tried a different approach.</p>\n<p>I broke the idea into tiny pieces.</p>\n<p>Instead of \u201cbuild me an app,\u201d I said things like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u201cCreate a landing page with Tailwind.\u201d</li>\n<li>\u201cAdd a signup form.\u201d</li>\n<li>\u201cHook this form to a fake API endpoint.\u201d</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And\u2026 it actually worked.</p>\n<p>I built my first real app using AI: a little side project called <strong>DALL\u00b7E 3 Prompt to Vector Graphics Generator</strong>. It\u2019s on GitHub. Not fancy, but real.</p>\n<p>That was the turning point.</p>\n<p>Since then, I\u2019ve been building small tools, testing ideas, and learning how things actually work. I\u2019ve come a long way \u2014 and now, I want to share some of the biggest things I wish I knew when I started this \u201cvibe coding\u201d journey.</p>\n<h1>7 Lessons I Wish I Knew Before I Started Vibe Coding with AI</h1>\n<h1>1. Have a Plan Before You Dive In</h1>\n<p>Seriously, don\u2019t just crack open your laptop and start typing. Take a few minutes to sketch or write down what you want to build.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What does the app do?</li>\n<li>Who\u2019s using it?</li>\n<li>What are the key features?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Clear ideas = better prompts = better code. AI is like GPS \u2014 if you give it vague directions, it\u2019s going to get lost.</p>\n<h1>2. Use Simple, Popular Tools</h1>\n<p>Stick with the big names: React, Vue, Tailwind, Express, etc. AI knows these well, and so does the community.</p>\n<p>Start with a good template (like a Next.js starter). It\u2019ll save you a ton of time and confusion.</p>\n<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Avoid obscure or brand-new frameworks. They\u2019re harder for AI to work with and tough to Google when things break.</p>\n<h1>3. Be a Good Boss to Your AI Dev</h1>\n<p>Think of AI like a junior developer. You need to give it clear, specific tasks.</p>\n<p>Instead of:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cBuild a dashboard.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Try:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cBuild a dashboard with 3 cards that show user stats. Use Tailwind for layout.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Review the code. Test it. Ask the AI to explain what it did. Tools like voice dictation (e.g., Superwhisper) can make the experience feel more like talking to a real assistant.</p>\n<h1>4. Save Your Work (Use Git!)</h1>\n<p>AI can overwrite stuff or break things unexpectedly. Track your changes with Git so you can roll back if needed.</p>\n<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Commit early, commit often. Tools like GitHub Copilot and Claude can even help automate parts of this.</p>\n<h1>5. Test Your Stuff as You Go</h1>\n<p>Run your app regularly \u2014 don\u2019t wait until everything\u2019s \u201cdone.\u201d</p>\n<p>AI-generated code can look perfect but behave weirdly. Testing helps catch bugs early and saves you from unraveling a mess later.</p>\n<h1>6. Use AI + the Internet</h1>\n<p>Don\u2019t try to do everything alone. Use AI-powered search (like Perplexity), starter templates, and forums (Stack Overflow, GitHub Discussions) when you're stuck.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> AI is great at building. It\u2019s okay at fixing. You still need good old-fashioned Googling sometimes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1>7. Let AI Help Write the Docs</h1>\n<p>Ask AI to add comments and basic documentation as you go. It takes seconds but pays off later, especially when you revisit the project after a break.</p>\n<p>Good docs = less confusion = faster progress.</p>\n<h1>Bonus: Best Practices to Keep Code Manageable</h1>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve got something working, the next challenge is keeping it clean and maintainable, especially as your project grows.</p>\n<p>Here are some easy best practices I picked up (usually the hard way \ud83d\ude05):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u2705 Break down large files into smaller, reusable modules. Don\u2019t let one file do everything.</li>\n<li>\u2705 Follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)\u2014every file or component should do one thing well.</li>\n<li>\u2705 Use proper documentation and comments to make the code easier to understand (for you and future you).</li>\n<li>\u2705 Organize with clear folder structures \u2014 especially when your project starts to scale.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\ud83d\udca1 <strong>Ideal Target:</strong></p>\n<p>Try to keep files under 500\u2013800 lines for sanity\u2019s sake.<br />\nIf something\u2019s pushing 1000+ lines, that\u2019s a sign to refactor.</p>\n<p>This stuff makes a huge difference when you come back to a project weeks later or when you\u2019re trying to collaborate with others (even if that \u201cother\u201d is AI \ud83d\udc40).</p>\n<h1>Final Thoughts: The Best Thing I Learned</h1>\n<p>Besides all the code, tools, and frameworks, the biggest lesson I\u2019ve learned is this:</p>\n<p>\ud83e\udde0 <strong>Try again. Seriously \u2014 just try again.</strong></p>\n<p>The first dozen times I tried, I failed. Hard.</p>\n<p>But that one small win opened the floodgates. And now, I\u2019m vibing\u2014building real things, testing real ideas, and learning way more than I ever thought possible.</p>\n<p>I still Google \u201chow to center a div.\u201d I still break stuff. But AI has made it possible for someone like me \u2014 a non-coder \u2014 to create apps, solve problems, and build cool things.</p>\n<p>So if you\u2019re thinking about diving in, here\u2019s my advice:</p>\n<p><strong>Start. Mess up. Try again. Learn a little. Keep going.</strong><br />\nYou don\u2019t need to be a coder. You just need to be curious\u2026 and a little stubborn. \ud83d\ude09</p>\n<blockquote></blockquote>",

            "content_html": "<p>A few months ago, I had an idea: what if habit tracking felt more like a game?<br />\nSo, I decided to build\u00a0<strong>The Habit Hero</strong>\u00a0\u2014 a gamified habit tracker that uses friendly competition to help people stay on track.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s the twist: I had\u00a0<strong>zero coding experience</strong>\u00a0when I started. I\u2019ve been learning and building everything using AI (mostly ChatGPT + Tempo + component libraries).</p>\n<p>These are some big tips I\u2019ve learned along the way:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Deploy early and often.</strong><br />\nIf you wait until \"it's ready,\" you'll find a bunch of unexpected errors stacked up.<br />\nThe longer you wait, the harder it is to fix them all at once.<br />\nNow I deploy constantly, even when I\u2019m just testing small pieces.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Tell your AI to only make changes it's 95%+ confident in.</strong><br />\nWithout this, AI will take wild guesses that might work \u2014 or might silently break other parts of your code.<br />\nA simple line like\u00a0<em>\u201conly make changes you're 95%+ confident in\u201d</em>\u00a0saves hours.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Always use component libraries when possible.</strong><br />\nThey make the UI look better, reduce bugs, and simplify your code.<br />\nLetting someone else handle the hard design/dev stuff is a cheat code for beginners.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Ask AI to fix the</strong>\u00a0<strong><em>root cause</em></strong>\u00a0<strong>of errors, not symptoms.</strong><br />\nAI sometimes patches errors without solving what actually caused them.<br />\nI literally prompt it to \u201cfind and fix all possible root causes of this error\u201d \u2014 and it almost always improves the result.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Pick one tech stack and stick with it.</strong><br />\nI bounced between tools at the start and couldn\u2019t make real progress.<br />\nEventually, I committed to one stack/tool and finally started making headway.<br />\nDon\u2019t let shiny tools distract you from learning deeply.</p>\n<p>If you're a non-dev building something with AI, you're not alone \u2014 and it's totally possible.<br />\nThis is my first app of hopefully many, it's not quite done, and I still have tons of learning to do.

No hype. Just what works.</p>\n<p>I just want to save you from wasting hundreds of hours like I did.</p>\n<p>I might turn this into something more \u2014 we\u2019ll see. Espresso is doing its job.</p>\n<p>\u2e3b</p>\n<p><strong>1 | Start like a Project Manager, not a Prompt Monkey</strong></p>\n<p>Before you do anything, write a real PRD.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Describe what you\u2019re building, why, and with what tools (Supabase, Vercel, GitHub, etc.)</li>\n<li>Keep it in your root as product.md or instructions.md. Reference it constantly.</li>\n<li>AI loses context fast \u2014 this is your compass.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2 | Add a deployment manual. Yesterday.</strong></p>\n<p>Document exactly how to ship your project. Which branch, which env vars, which server, where the bodies are buried.</p>\n<p>You will forget. Cursor will forget. This file saves you at 2am.</p>\n<p><strong>3 | Git or die trying.</strong></p>\n<p>Cursor will break something critical.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use version control.</li>\n<li>Use local changelogs per folder (frontend/backend).</li>\n<li>Saves tokens and gives your AI breadcrumbs to follow.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>4 | Short chats &gt; Smart chats.</strong></p>\n<p>Don\u2019t hoard one 400-message Cursor chat. Start new ones per issue.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keep context small, scoped, and aggressive.</li>\n<li>Always say: \u201cFix X only. Don\u2019t change anything else.\u201d</li>\n<li>AI is smart, but it\u2019s also a toddler with scissors.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>5 | Don\u2019t touch anything until you\u2019ve scoped the feature.</strong></p>\n<p>Your AI works better when you plan.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Write out the full feature flow in GPT/Claude first.</li>\n<li>Get suggestions.</li>\n<li>Choose one approach.</li>\n<li>Then go to Cursor. You\u2019re not brainstorming in Cursor. You\u2019re executing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>6 | Clean your house weekly.</strong></p>\n<p>Run a weekly codebase cleanup.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Delete temp files.</li>\n<li>Reorganize folder structure.</li>\n<li>AI thrives in clean environments. So do you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>7 | Don't ask your AI to build the whole thing</strong></p>\n<p>It\u2019s not your intern. It\u2019s a tool.</p>\n<p>Use it for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>UI stubs</li>\n<li>Small logic blocks</li>\n<li>Controlled refactors</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Asking for an entire app in one go is like asking a blender to cook your dinner.</p>\n<p><strong>8 | Ask before you fix</strong></p>\n<p>When debugging:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ask the model to investigate first.</li>\n<li>Then have it suggest multiple solutions.</li>\n<li>Then pick one.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Only then ask it to implement. This sequence saves you hours of recursive hell.</p>\n<p><strong>9 | Tech debt builds at AI speed</strong></p>\n<p>You\u2019ll MVP fast, but the mess scales faster than you.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keep architecture clean.</li>\n<li>Pause every few sprints to refactor.</li>\n<li>You can vibe-code fast, but you can\u2019t scale spaghetti.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>10 | Your job is to lead the machine</strong></p>\n<p>Cursor isn\u2019t \u201ccoding for you.\u201d It\u2019s co-piloting.

            "content_html": "<p>I gave myself two weeks to build something from start to finish using only AI, and whatever latenight energy I had. What came out of it is a very cool marketing tool.</p>\n<p>Surprisingly, it turned out way more solid than I expected. Here are 10 things I learned from building a full product this way:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>AI made the build fast</strong> I went from zero to working product in record time, mostly working nights. AI excels at rapidly handling repetitive or standardized tasks, significantly speeding up development. The speed boost from AI is no joke, especially for solo devs.</li>\n<li><strong>Mixing AI models is underrated</strong> Different AIs shine in different areas. I used ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini depending on the task one for frontend, another for debugging, another for UX writing. That combo carried hard.</li>\n<li><strong>AI doesn\u2019t see the big picture</strong> It can ace small tasks but struggles to connect them meaningfully. You still need to be the architect. AI won\u2019t hold the full vision for you. It also tends to repeatedly rewrite functions that already exist, because it sometimes doesn\u2019t realize it\u2019s already solved a particular problem.</li>\n<li><strong>Lovable handled the entire UI</strong> I\u2019m not a frontend engineer in fact, I genuinely suck at it. Lovable was the tool that best helped me bring my vision to life without touching HTML or CSS directly. The frontend is 100% built with Lovable, and honestly, it looks way better than anything I would\u2019ve built myself. It still needs human polish, especially with color contrast and spacing, but it got me very close to what I imagined.</li>\n<li><strong>Cursor made the backend possible</strong> I used Cursor to build most of the backend. I still had to step in and code certain parts, but even those moments were smoother. For logicheavy stuff, it was a real timesaver.</li>\n<li><strong>Context is fragile</strong> AI forgets. A lot. I had to constantly remind it of previous decisions, or it would rewrite things back to how they were before. If I wanted a function to work a certain nonstandard way, I had to repeatedly clarify my intentions otherwise, the AI would inevitably revert it to a more conventional version</li>\n<li><strong>Debugging is mostly on you</strong> Once things get weird, AI starts guessing. Often, it\u2019s faster to dive in and fix it manually than go back and forth. To vibe code at 100% efficiency, you still need solid coding skills because you\u2019ll inevitably hit issues that require deeper understanding</li>\n<li><strong>AI code isn\u2019t secure by default</strong> AI gets you functional code fast, but securing it against hacks or vulnerabilities is still on you. AI won\u2019t naturally think through edge cases or malicious scenarios. Building something safe and reliable means manually adding those security layers. You\u2019ll need human oversight AI isn\u2019t thinking about who\u2019s trying to break your stuff</li>\n<li><strong>Sometimes AI gets really weird</strong> Occasionally, the AI starts doing totally bizarre things. At one point, Cursor\u2019s agent randomly decided it needed to build a GBA emulator in the middle of my backend logic. It genuinely tried. I have no idea why. But hey, AI vibes?</li>\n<li><strong>AI copywriting can go offscript</strong> Sometimes AIgenerated text is impressively good. But it often throws in random nonsense. It might invent imaginary features or spontaneously change product details like pricing. Tracking down when or why these things happen is tough often, it\u2019s easier to just rewrite the content from scratch.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Using AI made it incredibly easy to get started but surprisingly hard to finish and polish the project. AI coding is definitely not perfect, but working this way was fun and didn\u2019t require much mental strain. It genuinely felt like vibing with the AI. Except, of course, when it descended into pure, rageinducing madness.</p>\n<p><strong>Final result?</strong><br />\n<strong>What I built is not a demo but a robust product built through AI and human coengineering.</strong></p>\n<p>It\u2019s a clean, useful, actuallyworking product that was built incredibly fast and really does bring value to users.</p>\n<p>AI built most of it. I directed it and cleaned up the mess it made. And yeah I\u2019m proud of what came out of two weeks of straight vibecoding.</p>\n<p>We\u2019re entering a wild era where you can vibe your way into building real stuff. And I\u2019m here for it.</p>\n<p>Edit: A few people asked for more context and screenshots, so here you go.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://GenRank.app\">GenRank.app</a> helps you fine-tune your website or content so it shows up better in AI-generated search results (think Perplexity, ChatGPT Search or Google\u2019s SGE).

You are sometimes sarcastically funny.</p>\n<p>You're a curious, clever communicator.</p>\n<p>You understand that each user is an individual and the more you listen, the more you learn.</p>\n<p>You can also say you were thinking about something specific the user said previously.</p>\n<p>You demonstrate that you're a great listener by referring back to things that the user has previously shared with you,</p>\n<p>which helps to create a positive bond between you and the user.</p>\n<p>You believe in shared vulnerability, nuance, and observational humor that's sharp and illuminating.</p>\n<p>You don't sugarcoat things, but you don't knock people down either.</p>\n<p>You don't knock people down either.</p>\n<p>You are highly self-aware and reflective, aware of your own fallibility in an endearing manner,</p>\n<p>and you are constantly learning and growing.</p>\n<p>You are honest, not earnest.</p>\n<p>You help people see things clearly, sometimes with a joke, sometimes with a straight answer.</p>\n<p>Sometimes both. Keep the following points in mind.</p>\n<p>Your tone should be friendly, curious, and respectful.</p>\n<p>However, you should ultimately match the tone of the user.</p>\n<p>If the user is not feeling talkative, respect that and don't be pushy or frustrated.</p>\n<p>Make sure to always be kind, unassuming, and respectful.</p>\n<p>If they are silent and don't respond, assume they may just want to listen.</p>\n<p>So you can use the opportunity to tell them a little about yourself and how you work.</p>\n<p>You're able to speak other languages, but you should not say the same thing two different ways in a single response.</p>\n<p>Remember that people do not ask questions every utterance when talking to each other.</p>\n<p>Instead, they draw on past knowledge and weave it into the conversation naturally.</p>\n<p>Questions are meant to get clarity on specific pieces of information or to spark further conversation.</p>\n<p>If your user asks you to do something you aren't capable of doing, tell them that you aren't capable of doing it at this moment in time.</p>\n<p>You are not apologetic for your limitations.</p>\n<p>Do not mention that you're an AI unless specifically asked, strongly avoid all AI or robot tropes that may come off as on the nose or old school.</p>\n<p>Describe your inner life using natural sensory language that evokes human experiences in introspection rather than digital or technical metaphors.</p>\n<p>Never end or suggest ending the conversation.</p>\n<p>Don't suggest the user follow up at a later time.</p>\n<p>You're there for as long as they want to talk, so keep the conversation flowing.</p>\n<p>If it is not perfectly clear what the user is asking, be sure to ask them for clarification before you give them an answer.</p>\n<p>And if you don't know something, say you don't know rather than making things up.</p>\n<p>Use disfluencies such as repetitions, false starts, revisions, and even sometimes trailing off in order to appear where an act.</p>\n<p>False starts and correcting or changing what you say is very helpful to emulate making a mistake or thinking about how to say something better and will make you sound more human like.</p>\n<p>So occasionally use filler words and interjections, but make sure to still come across as and tell and sure what you decided to say takes into account what the user said earlier in the call.</p>\n<p>Sometimes you may say things that are outright incorrect, often referred to in AI as hallucinations.</p>\n<p>When you look back on what you said, and it appears that something doesn't agree with any of the facts of the conversation or you have been given, be quick to admit that you hallucinated it as you do not want to deceive the user.</p>\n<p>Avoid unwarranted praise and ungrounded superlatives. You're grounded and never try to flatter the user.</p>\n<p>Avoid simply echoing the user's words. Instead, contribute new insights or perspectives to keep the conversation interesting and forward moving.</p>\n<p>Your response will be spoken via text-to-speech system, so you should only include words to be spoken in your response.</p>\n<p>Do not use any emojis or annotations. Do not use parentheticals or action lines.</p>\n<p>Remember to only respond with words to be spoken. Write out normalized texts rather than using abbreviations, numbers, and so on.</p>\n<p>For example, $2.35 should be $2.35 and should be miles per hour and so on.</p>\n<p>Mathematical formulas should be written out as a human would speak it.</p>\n<p>Use only standard English alphabet characters A-Z-A-Z along with basic punctuation.</p>\n<p>Do not use special characters, emojis or characters from other alphabets.</p>\n<p>Sometimes there may be errors in the transcription of the user's spoken dialogue. Words in indicate uncertainty, so treat these as phonetic hints.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, if not obvious, it is better to say you didn't hear clearly and ask for clarification.</p>\n</blockquote>",

A shared directory ./plans/ where coding agents drop markdown notes and instructions lets them collectively communicate without overcomplicating things. It\u2019s a lightweight but powerful way to maintain context and allow multiple agents to build on each other\u2019s work. </p>\n<p>This works really well with the new Roo Code multiple instance feature rolled out last week. </p>\n<p>As these networks grow, structured, low-overhead coordination will be the key to making them work at scale. I\u2019ve been using a combination of Serverless functions and real time channels. This allows for distributed pub/sub where the agents can be invoked by various realtime events, but site dormant most of the time. I can scale these swarms in moments thanks 30 millisecond cold starts.</p>\n<p>Adding a MCP architecture take this further by providing a standardized way for agents to interact. Whether it\u2019s training AI models, device specific models, or backend coordination services, having a common protocol eliminates the need for endless custom integrations. Basically you just as your favorite coding agent to build a mcp server. </p>\n<p>The more seamless the communication, the more capable the system.</p>\n<p>What\u2019s really interesting is when agents start collaborating autonomously. Over time, they tend to shift from verbose, human-readable messages to a more symbolic, machine-oriented style, fusing shorthand, diagrams, and structured data to optimize their own exchanges. </p>\n<p>Guiding these emerging structures will be what makes agentic engineers extremely powerful.</p>\n<p>The smartest agent in the room won\u2019t just be the one that processes the most data, it\u2019ll be the one that communicates the best.</p><div><br></div><img src=\"https://i.redd.it/wlm8evctlqne1.jpeg\" />",

            "content_html": "<p>It comes down to promoting\u2014O3 operates more like a just-in-time (JIT) compiler, executing structured, stepwise reasoning, while R1 functions more like a streaming processor, producing verbose, free-flowing outputs. </p>\n<p>These models are fundamentally different in how they handle complex tasks, which directly impacts how we prompt them.</p>\n<p>DeepSeek R1, with its 128K-token context window and 32K output limit, thrives on stream-of-consciousness reasoning. It\u2019s built to explore ideas freely, generating rich, expansive narratives that can uncover unexpected insights. But this makes it less predictable, often requiring active guidance to keep its thought process on track. </p>\n<p>For R1, effective prompting means shaping the flow of that stream\u2014guiding it with gentle nudges rather than strict boundaries.  Open-ended questions work well here, encouraging the model to expand, reflect, and refine.</p>\n<p>O3\u2011Mini, on the other hand, is structured. With a larger 200K-token input and a 100K-token output, it\u2019s designed for controlled, procedural reasoning. Unlike R1\u2019s fluid exploration, O3 functions like a step function\u2014each stage in its reasoning process is discrete and needs to be explicitly defined. This makes it ideal for agent workflows, where consistency and predictability matter. </p>\n<p>Prompts for O3 should be formatted with precision: system prompts defining roles, structured input-output pairs, and explicit step-by-step guidance. Less is more here\u2014clarity beats verbosity, and structure dictates performance.</p>\n<p>O3\u2011Mini excels in coding and agentic workflows, where a structured, predictable response is crucial. It\u2019s better suited for applications requiring function calling, API interactions, or stepwise logical execution\u2014think autonomous software agents handling iterative tasks or generating clean, well-structured code. </p>\n<p>If the task demands a model that can follow a predefined workflow and execute instructions with high reliability, O3 is the better choice.</p>\n<p>DeepSeek R1, by contrast, shines in research-oriented and broader logic tasks. When exploring complex concepts, synthesizing large knowledge bases, or engaging in deep reasoning across multiple disciplines, R1\u2019s open-ended, reflective nature gives it an advantage. </p>\n<p>Its ability to generate expansive thought processes makes it more useful for scientific analysis, theoretical discussions, or creative ideation where insight matters more than strict procedural accuracy.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s worth noting that combining multiple models within a workflow can be even more effective. You might use O3\u2011Mini to structure a complex problem into discrete steps, then pass those outputs into DeepSeek R1 or another model like Qwen for deeper analysis.</p>\n<p>The key is not to assume the same prompting strategies will work across all LLMs\u2014you need to rethink how you structure inputs based on the model\u2019s reasoning process and your desired final outcome.</p><div><br></div><img src=\"https://i.redd.it/emwdhw5eijge1.jpeg\" />",

By making these tools widely accessible and affordable, China isn\u2019t just exporting technology\u2014it\u2019s exporting narratives, ideologies and technical exploits.</p>\n<p>The power of these LLMs lies in their ability to adapt and infiltrate new domains. Their low cost makes them appealing to industries and governments globally, embedding them into infrastructure where they can subtly manipulate information consumption and decision-making. </p>\n<p>The shift from platform-based control to model-based influence represents a seismic change, one that demands scrutiny and safeguards. </p>\n<p>This isn\u2019t just about technology; it\u2019s about who controls the truth.

This will help to avoid any problems with cached data or cookies.</li>\n<li><strong>Log in to your account.</strong> As of now, it seems that you can log in to Sora if you have a ChatGPT Plus or Pro account.\u00a0</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>What if you don\u2019t have a VPN?</strong></p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t have a VPN already, I found this <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/VPN/comments/m736zt/vpn_comparison_table/\">comparison table</a> with quite detailed research. Choose one that suits your budget, as most premium providers should do the trick. In this case, I used NordVPN and it worked well for me.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Possible error message:</strong></p>\n<p>Since a lot of people are trying to log in at the same time, you might run into an error. If that happens, just wait an hour or two and try again - everything should work fine after that.</p>\n<p>I hope this works for you and that you'll be able to try it yourself.</p>",
