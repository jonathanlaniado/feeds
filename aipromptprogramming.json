            "content_html": "<p>It comes down to promoting\u2014O3 operates more like a just-in-time (JIT) compiler, executing structured, stepwise reasoning, while R1 functions more like a streaming processor, producing verbose, free-flowing outputs. </p>\n<p>These models are fundamentally different in how they handle complex tasks, which directly impacts how we prompt them.</p>\n<p>DeepSeek R1, with its 128K-token context window and 32K output limit, thrives on stream-of-consciousness reasoning. It\u2019s built to explore ideas freely, generating rich, expansive narratives that can uncover unexpected insights. But this makes it less predictable, often requiring active guidance to keep its thought process on track. </p>\n<p>For R1, effective prompting means shaping the flow of that stream\u2014guiding it with gentle nudges rather than strict boundaries.  Open-ended questions work well here, encouraging the model to expand, reflect, and refine.</p>\n<p>O3\u2011Mini, on the other hand, is structured. With a larger 200K-token input and a 100K-token output, it\u2019s designed for controlled, procedural reasoning. Unlike R1\u2019s fluid exploration, O3 functions like a step function\u2014each stage in its reasoning process is discrete and needs to be explicitly defined. This makes it ideal for agent workflows, where consistency and predictability matter. </p>\n<p>Prompts for O3 should be formatted with precision: system prompts defining roles, structured input-output pairs, and explicit step-by-step guidance. Less is more here\u2014clarity beats verbosity, and structure dictates performance.</p>\n<p>O3\u2011Mini excels in coding and agentic workflows, where a structured, predictable response is crucial. It\u2019s better suited for applications requiring function calling, API interactions, or stepwise logical execution\u2014think autonomous software agents handling iterative tasks or generating clean, well-structured code. </p>\n<p>If the task demands a model that can follow a predefined workflow and execute instructions with high reliability, O3 is the better choice.</p>\n<p>DeepSeek R1, by contrast, shines in research-oriented and broader logic tasks. When exploring complex concepts, synthesizing large knowledge bases, or engaging in deep reasoning across multiple disciplines, R1\u2019s open-ended, reflective nature gives it an advantage. </p>\n<p>Its ability to generate expansive thought processes makes it more useful for scientific analysis, theoretical discussions, or creative ideation where insight matters more than strict procedural accuracy.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s worth noting that combining multiple models within a workflow can be even more effective. You might use O3\u2011Mini to structure a complex problem into discrete steps, then pass those outputs into DeepSeek R1 or another model like Qwen for deeper analysis.</p>\n<p>The key is not to assume the same prompting strategies will work across all LLMs\u2014you need to rethink how you structure inputs based on the model\u2019s reasoning process and your desired final outcome.</p><div><br></div><img src=\"https://i.redd.it/emwdhw5eijge1.jpeg\" />",

This is where AI \u201challucinations\u201d become more than just mistakes\u2014they become glimpses into what might be possible. </p>\n<p>Many of these so-called hallucinations are not errors but conjectures, ideas that seem plausible yet have never been implemented. </p>\n<p>The challenge\u2014and opportunity\u2014is in recognizing which of these can be transformed into real, working systems.</p>\n<p>In computer science, these conjectures often represent novel solutions\u2014paths that haven\u2019t been taken, architectures that haven\u2019t been tested, ideas waiting for execution. </p>\n<p>The Cohen Conjecture, which I formulated and implemented live, is exactly this: a synthesis of agentic systems and neuro-symbolic reasoning, tested and deployed in under an hour.</p>\n<p>The real breakthrough isn\u2019t just in formulating these conjectures\u2014it\u2019s in proving them, rapidly. With tools like O1 Pro to generate the conjecture itself, Klein and Sonnet 3.5 to write the supporting code, and agentic systems coordinating everything, an entire framework was built, implemented, and deployed in real time. This wasn\u2019t theoretical. It was live, tangible, functional.</p>\n<p>This is where AI changes the game\u2014not by replacing humans, but by amplifying our ability to bridge the gap between theory and reality at speeds we\u2019ve never seen before.

By making these tools widely accessible and affordable, China isn\u2019t just exporting technology\u2014it\u2019s exporting narratives, ideologies and technical exploits.</p>\n<p>The power of these LLMs lies in their ability to adapt and infiltrate new domains. Their low cost makes them appealing to industries and governments globally, embedding them into infrastructure where they can subtly manipulate information consumption and decision-making. </p>\n<p>The shift from platform-based control to model-based influence represents a seismic change, one that demands scrutiny and safeguards. </p>\n<p>This isn\u2019t just about technology; it\u2019s about who controls the truth.

This will help to avoid any problems with cached data or cookies.</li>\n<li><strong>Log in to your account.</strong> As of now, it seems that you can log in to Sora if you have a ChatGPT Plus or Pro account.\u00a0</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>What if you don\u2019t have a VPN?</strong></p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t have a VPN already, I found this <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/VPN/comments/m736zt/vpn_comparison_table/\">comparison table</a> with quite detailed research. Choose one that suits your budget, as most premium providers should do the trick. In this case, I used NordVPN and it worked well for me.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Possible error message:</strong></p>\n<p>Since a lot of people are trying to log in at the same time, you might run into an error. If that happens, just wait an hour or two and try again - everything should work fine after that.</p>\n<p>I hope this works for you and that you'll be able to try it yourself.</p>",

It\u2019s trivial to us. The same goes for an LLM.</p>\n<p>It can simply output the answer.</p>\n<p>However, asking a question such as \u201cWhat color is the sky across the hours of the day?\u201d is much harder.</p>\n<p>The color will change depending on the weather, the time of day, humidity, and a gazillion other factors. If a human would try to answer this question, she would probably have to break the reasoning into multiple steps.</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How does the color of the sky change when the angle of the sun changes relative to the Earth?</li>\n<li>How does humidity influence this change?</li>\n<li>\u2026</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Then, a human would try to draw upon physical principles to explain each of these effects. Lastly, she would draw general conclusions based on these principles before working herself across different levels of abstraction to come up with a satisfactory answer.</p>\n<p>Boom.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe sky goes from blue to red to black, whereas the red is more pronounced on humid days.\u201d</p>\n<p>This multi-step reasoning is one of the hardest challenges for LLMs to date.</p>\n<p>Most of the errors a model makes on benchmarks happen during this kind of reasoning. Different methods, such as chain-of-though prompting have been used to improve these shortcomings.</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL2FyeGl2Lm9yZy9wZGYvMjMxMC4wNjExNy5wZGY_dXRtX3NvdXJjZT13d3cudGhlZGVjb2RpbmcubmV0JnV0bV9tZWRpdW09cmVmZXJyYWwmdXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPWEtc2ltcGxlLXRyaWNrLXRoYXQtaW1wcm92ZXMtcmVhc29uaW5nLWluLWxsbXMiLCJwb3N0X2lkIjoiMjkzMTJmZWItN2MyOC00N2VmLWI1OGEtMjhmOTM4YjI4MjEyIiwicHVibGljYXRpb25faWQiOiIwMWEzNmYyMC00Y2I5LTQ0ZDAtOTU5MS1lMmM2OWViM2M5NzciLCJ2aXNpdF90b2tlbiI6ImNhZjJiYmQ2LTQzMDUtNDk0My1hOGM5LTIxZWNkNGFjNTk3MSIsImlhdCI6MTcxMjc3MzU3NiwiaXNzIjoib3JjaGlkIn0.wH7mlF1F9PVhBWQOO0G8PgbP1DzyPAoqsh8rEhNjAt0\"><em>recent paper</em></a>, researchers from Google DeepMind proposed to ask so-called step-back questions to improve the model\u2019s reasoning abilities.</p>\n<p>In the following, we will look at how this works and see how we can use it to improve our workflows.</p>\n<h2>What Is A Step-Back Question?</h2>\n<p>The authors define a step-back question as a question at a higher level of abstraction that is derived from the original question.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say we want a model to answer our sky-color question from above. A step-back question would ask the model to provide us with a list of all possible colors the sky can have.</p>\n<p>So far so simple.</p>\n<p>But why is this helpful?</p>\n<p>The authors argue that step-back questions work because it is typically much easier to answer them first to obtain helpful abstractions. Grounding a final answer in these abstractions helps to avoid reasoning errors in intermediate steps.</p>\n<p>Here is how the authors suggest implementing this strategy.</p>\n<h2>How To Do Step-Back Prompting</h2>\n<p>In the paper, the authors suggest to perform two distinct steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Abstraction</strong>: The model is prompted to ask a generic step-back question about the concepts that underlie the original question., such as: \u201cWhat are the physics principles involved in solving this problem?\u201d</li>\n<li><strong>Reasoning</strong>: In this second step, the model is asked the original question. In doing so, it is provided with the output of the step-back prompt. The authors term this step Abstraction-grounded Reasoning because the model can reason about the solution using information about the high-level concept or principle.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Before we wrap up, I would like to emphasize another neat aspect of the paper.</p>\n<h2>Categorizing Errors In Step-Back Results</h2>\n<p>Comparing the results from step-back prompting against the baseline of using the PaLM-2L model shows that the method corrects 20.5% of errors while introducing 11.9% of new ones.</p>\n<p>So, a net positive of 10%.</p>\n<p>To further understand what types of errors were made by the model, the false outputs are annotated. This split the errors into five different classes.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/fae4brvm3ptc1.png?width=914&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57cf71c05297ee834fc30ef88fad45033be13a4f</p>\n<p>Four of the five error types happen during the reasoning step.</p>\n<p>Combined, they make up over 90% of all errors made by the model. Less than 10% of errors are caused by the model creating the wrong abstractions (Principle Error) during step-back prompting.</p>\n<p>So, reasoning remains the bottleneck.</p>\n<p>I would have liked to see a comparison of the error distribution with and without step-back prompting. However, a net reduction in errors of 10% is still great for such a simple method.</p>\n<p>Thank you for reading! I hope this gave you some food for thought. Go ahead and check out the original paper. It\u2019s a fun read.</p>\n<p>Lots of love and speak soon!</p>\n<p>P.s.

In the future, if a very similar prompt is presented, past answers are injected into the prompt as n-shot examples.</p>\n<p>EXISTING: This technique seems obvious but I haven't found any prior implementations, yet.  There are several similar techniques, but no 100% matches.  RAG over chat history can do the same things but this is much more precise and effective.  Reflexion's long-term memory seems very similar or perhaps identical, but I'm not sure.</p>\n<p>MECHANISM: The decision of what to store is based on if the agent had to do multiple tries to get an answer correct (e.g. during reflexion) or if human intervention was required to edit an answer to fix issues.</p>\n<p>USE AS KNOWLEDGE:  Another use for this is pre-populated knowledge.  You could populate the store with pre-made prompts ready for use.  This would likely be a highly effective alternative to fine-tuning.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Is there anything like this?  Is this a sub-component of Reflexion?  Are there standalone implementations?</p>",

It\u2019s powerful, and pricey. Here are my results.</p>\n<p>The introduction of a 128,000-token context window by OpenAI is an impressive addition, enabling far more intricate and detailed interactions with OpenAi. </p>\n<p>This capability allows for processing the equivalent of 300 page long-form documents or 25,600 lines of code in a single prompt, making it an invaluable tool for applications requiring deep context, such as thorough document analysis, extensive dialog interactions, and complex reasoning scenarios.</p>\n<p>Cost-wise, leveraging the GPT-4 Turbo model, the input cost is $0.01 per 1,000 tokens, and the output cost is $0.03 per 1,000 tokens. </p>\n<p>Below are estimated costs for different uses:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Complex Legal Analysis</li>\n<li>Input: 128,000 tokens.</li>\n<li>Output: 20,000 tokens.</li>\n<li>Input Cost: $1.28</li>\n<li>Output Cost: $0.60</li>\n<li>\n<p>Combined: $1.88 per request.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Extensive Technical Support</p>\n</li>\n<li>Input: 64,000 tokens (half of the context).</li>\n<li>Output: 8,000 tokens.</li>\n<li>Input Cost: $0.64</li>\n<li>Output Cost: $0.24</li>\n<li>\n<p>Combined: $0.88 per request.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In-Depth Medical Consultation</p>\n</li>\n<li>Input: 128,000 tokens.</li>\n<li>Output: 15,000 tokens.</li>\n<li>Input Cost: $1.28</li>\n<li>Output Cost: $0.45</li>\n<li>\n<p>Combined: $1.73 per request.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Code Review for Security Vulnerabilities (25,600 lines of code)</p>\n</li>\n<li>Input: 128,000 tokens.</li>\n<li>Output: 25,000 tokens.</li>\n<li>Input Cost: $1.28</li>\n<li>Output Cost: $0.75</li>\n<li>Combined: $2.03 per request.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For an enterprise deployment of 10,000 users making two requests per day:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Daily Input Cost per User: 2 requests * $1.28 = $2.56</li>\n<li>Daily Output Cost per User: 2 requests * $0.30 = $0.60 (assuming 10,000 tokens per output)</li>\n<li>Daily Combined Cost per User: $3.16</li>\n<li>Daily Combined Cost for 10,000 Users: $31,600</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These costs provide a framework for understanding the potential investment required for utilizing this advanced OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo 128k, and actual expenses would depend on the exact nature and volume of usage, but should give you a pretty good idea.</p>\n<p>One drawback, the context window seems to struggle in certain areas, some might refer to this as U problems it seems to be more of W, where certain areas don\u2019t seem to be as contextually aware. </p>\n<p>Lots of really interesting opportunities.</p>",
