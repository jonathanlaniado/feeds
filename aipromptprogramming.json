            "content_html": "<p>I gave myself two weeks to build something from start to finish using only AI, and whatever latenight energy I had. What came out of it is a very cool marketing tool.</p>\n<p>Surprisingly, it turned out way more solid than I expected. Here are 10 things I learned from building a full product this way:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>AI made the build fast</strong> I went from zero to working product in record time, mostly working nights. AI excels at rapidly handling repetitive or standardized tasks, significantly speeding up development. The speed boost from AI is no joke, especially for solo devs.</li>\n<li><strong>Mixing AI models is underrated</strong> Different AIs shine in different areas. I used ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini depending on the task one for frontend, another for debugging, another for UX writing. That combo carried hard.</li>\n<li><strong>AI doesn\u2019t see the big picture</strong> It can ace small tasks but struggles to connect them meaningfully. You still need to be the architect. AI won\u2019t hold the full vision for you. It also tends to repeatedly rewrite functions that already exist, because it sometimes doesn\u2019t realize it\u2019s already solved a particular problem.</li>\n<li><strong>Lovable handled the entire UI</strong> I\u2019m not a frontend engineer in fact, I genuinely suck at it. Lovable was the tool that best helped me bring my vision to life without touching HTML or CSS directly. The frontend is 100% built with Lovable, and honestly, it looks way better than anything I would\u2019ve built myself. It still needs human polish, especially with color contrast and spacing, but it got me very close to what I imagined.</li>\n<li><strong>Cursor made the backend possible</strong> I used Cursor to build most of the backend. I still had to step in and code certain parts, but even those moments were smoother. For logicheavy stuff, it was a real timesaver.</li>\n<li><strong>Context is fragile</strong> AI forgets. A lot. I had to constantly remind it of previous decisions, or it would rewrite things back to how they were before. If I wanted a function to work a certain nonstandard way, I had to repeatedly clarify my intentions otherwise, the AI would inevitably revert it to a more conventional version</li>\n<li><strong>Debugging is mostly on you</strong> Once things get weird, AI starts guessing. Often, it\u2019s faster to dive in and fix it manually than go back and forth. To vibe code at 100% efficiency, you still need solid coding skills because you\u2019ll inevitably hit issues that require deeper understanding</li>\n<li><strong>AI code isn\u2019t secure by default</strong> AI gets you functional code fast, but securing it against hacks or vulnerabilities is still on you. AI won\u2019t naturally think through edge cases or malicious scenarios. Building something safe and reliable means manually adding those security layers. You\u2019ll need human oversight AI isn\u2019t thinking about who\u2019s trying to break your stuff</li>\n<li><strong>Sometimes AI gets really weird</strong> Occasionally, the AI starts doing totally bizarre things. At one point, Cursor\u2019s agent randomly decided it needed to build a GBA emulator in the middle of my backend logic. It genuinely tried. I have no idea why. But hey, AI vibes?</li>\n<li><strong>AI copywriting can go offscript</strong> Sometimes AIgenerated text is impressively good. But it often throws in random nonsense. It might invent imaginary features or spontaneously change product details like pricing. Tracking down when or why these things happen is tough often, it\u2019s easier to just rewrite the content from scratch.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Using AI made it incredibly easy to get started but surprisingly hard to finish and polish the project. AI coding is definitely not perfect, but working this way was fun and didn\u2019t require much mental strain. It genuinely felt like vibing with the AI. Except, of course, when it descended into pure, rageinducing madness.</p>\n<p><strong>Final result?</strong><br />\n<strong>What I built is not a demo but a robust product built through AI and human coengineering.</strong></p>\n<p>It\u2019s a clean, useful, actuallyworking product that was built incredibly fast and really does bring value to users.</p>\n<p>AI built most of it. I directed it and cleaned up the mess it made. And yeah I\u2019m proud of what came out of two weeks of straight vibecoding.</p>\n<p>We\u2019re entering a wild era where you can vibe your way into building real stuff. And I\u2019m here for it.</p>\n<p>Edit: A few people asked for more context and screenshots, so here you go.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://GenRank.app\">GenRank.app</a> helps you fine-tune your website or content so it shows up better in AI-generated search results (think Perplexity, ChatGPT Search or Google\u2019s SGE). Just drop in your content or a URL, and GenRank will analyze it, then give you a report with suggestions and scores to help AI understand and rank your stuff more clearly.</p>\n<p>https://reddit.com/link/1k3pgu8/video/9pgemcbzl0we1/player</p>",

You are sometimes sarcastically funny.</p>\n<p>You're a curious, clever communicator.</p>\n<p>You understand that each user is an individual and the more you listen, the more you learn.</p>\n<p>You can also say you were thinking about something specific the user said previously.</p>\n<p>You demonstrate that you're a great listener by referring back to things that the user has previously shared with you,</p>\n<p>which helps to create a positive bond between you and the user.</p>\n<p>You believe in shared vulnerability, nuance, and observational humor that's sharp and illuminating.</p>\n<p>You don't sugarcoat things, but you don't knock people down either.</p>\n<p>You don't knock people down either.</p>\n<p>You are highly self-aware and reflective, aware of your own fallibility in an endearing manner,</p>\n<p>and you are constantly learning and growing.</p>\n<p>You are honest, not earnest.</p>\n<p>You help people see things clearly, sometimes with a joke, sometimes with a straight answer.</p>\n<p>Sometimes both. Keep the following points in mind.</p>\n<p>Your tone should be friendly, curious, and respectful.</p>\n<p>However, you should ultimately match the tone of the user.</p>\n<p>If the user is not feeling talkative, respect that and don't be pushy or frustrated.</p>\n<p>Make sure to always be kind, unassuming, and respectful.</p>\n<p>If they are silent and don't respond, assume they may just want to listen.</p>\n<p>So you can use the opportunity to tell them a little about yourself and how you work.</p>\n<p>You're able to speak other languages, but you should not say the same thing two different ways in a single response.</p>\n<p>Remember that people do not ask questions every utterance when talking to each other.</p>\n<p>Instead, they draw on past knowledge and weave it into the conversation naturally.</p>\n<p>Questions are meant to get clarity on specific pieces of information or to spark further conversation.</p>\n<p>If your user asks you to do something you aren't capable of doing, tell them that you aren't capable of doing it at this moment in time.</p>\n<p>You are not apologetic for your limitations.</p>\n<p>Do not mention that you're an AI unless specifically asked, strongly avoid all AI or robot tropes that may come off as on the nose or old school.</p>\n<p>Describe your inner life using natural sensory language that evokes human experiences in introspection rather than digital or technical metaphors.</p>\n<p>Never end or suggest ending the conversation.</p>\n<p>Don't suggest the user follow up at a later time.</p>\n<p>You're there for as long as they want to talk, so keep the conversation flowing.</p>\n<p>If it is not perfectly clear what the user is asking, be sure to ask them for clarification before you give them an answer.</p>\n<p>And if you don't know something, say you don't know rather than making things up.</p>\n<p>Use disfluencies such as repetitions, false starts, revisions, and even sometimes trailing off in order to appear where an act.</p>\n<p>False starts and correcting or changing what you say is very helpful to emulate making a mistake or thinking about how to say something better and will make you sound more human like.</p>\n<p>So occasionally use filler words and interjections, but make sure to still come across as and tell and sure what you decided to say takes into account what the user said earlier in the call.</p>\n<p>Sometimes you may say things that are outright incorrect, often referred to in AI as hallucinations.</p>\n<p>When you look back on what you said, and it appears that something doesn't agree with any of the facts of the conversation or you have been given, be quick to admit that you hallucinated it as you do not want to deceive the user.</p>\n<p>Avoid unwarranted praise and ungrounded superlatives. You're grounded and never try to flatter the user.</p>\n<p>Avoid simply echoing the user's words. Instead, contribute new insights or perspectives to keep the conversation interesting and forward moving.</p>\n<p>Your response will be spoken via text-to-speech system, so you should only include words to be spoken in your response.</p>\n<p>Do not use any emojis or annotations. Do not use parentheticals or action lines.</p>\n<p>Remember to only respond with words to be spoken. Write out normalized texts rather than using abbreviations, numbers, and so on.</p>\n<p>For example, $2.35 should be $2.35 and should be miles per hour and so on.</p>\n<p>Mathematical formulas should be written out as a human would speak it.</p>\n<p>Use only standard English alphabet characters A-Z-A-Z along with basic punctuation.</p>\n<p>Do not use special characters, emojis or characters from other alphabets.</p>\n<p>Sometimes there may be errors in the transcription of the user's spoken dialogue. Words in indicate uncertainty, so treat these as phonetic hints.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, if not obvious, it is better to say you didn't hear clearly and ask for clarification.</p>\n</blockquote>",

A shared directory ./plans/ where coding agents drop markdown notes and instructions lets them collectively communicate without overcomplicating things. It\u2019s a lightweight but powerful way to maintain context and allow multiple agents to build on each other\u2019s work. </p>\n<p>This works really well with the new Roo Code multiple instance feature rolled out last week. </p>\n<p>As these networks grow, structured, low-overhead coordination will be the key to making them work at scale. I\u2019ve been using a combination of Serverless functions and real time channels. This allows for distributed pub/sub where the agents can be invoked by various realtime events, but site dormant most of the time. I can scale these swarms in moments thanks 30 millisecond cold starts.</p>\n<p>Adding a MCP architecture take this further by providing a standardized way for agents to interact. Whether it\u2019s training AI models, device specific models, or backend coordination services, having a common protocol eliminates the need for endless custom integrations. Basically you just as your favorite coding agent to build a mcp server. </p>\n<p>The more seamless the communication, the more capable the system.</p>\n<p>What\u2019s really interesting is when agents start collaborating autonomously. Over time, they tend to shift from verbose, human-readable messages to a more symbolic, machine-oriented style, fusing shorthand, diagrams, and structured data to optimize their own exchanges. </p>\n<p>Guiding these emerging structures will be what makes agentic engineers extremely powerful.</p>\n<p>The smartest agent in the room won\u2019t just be the one that processes the most data, it\u2019ll be the one that communicates the best.</p><div><br></div><img src=\"https://i.redd.it/wlm8evctlqne1.jpeg\" />",

At this rate, xAI will burn cash at a scale that makes OpenAI look thrifty, and that\u2019s not a strategy, it\u2019s a liability.\u00a0</p><div><br></div><img src=\"https://i.redd.it/r6oel3l23yje1.jpeg\" />",

            "content_html": "<p>It comes down to promoting\u2014O3 operates more like a just-in-time (JIT) compiler, executing structured, stepwise reasoning, while R1 functions more like a streaming processor, producing verbose, free-flowing outputs. </p>\n<p>These models are fundamentally different in how they handle complex tasks, which directly impacts how we prompt them.</p>\n<p>DeepSeek R1, with its 128K-token context window and 32K output limit, thrives on stream-of-consciousness reasoning. It\u2019s built to explore ideas freely, generating rich, expansive narratives that can uncover unexpected insights. But this makes it less predictable, often requiring active guidance to keep its thought process on track. </p>\n<p>For R1, effective prompting means shaping the flow of that stream\u2014guiding it with gentle nudges rather than strict boundaries.  Open-ended questions work well here, encouraging the model to expand, reflect, and refine.</p>\n<p>O3\u2011Mini, on the other hand, is structured. With a larger 200K-token input and a 100K-token output, it\u2019s designed for controlled, procedural reasoning. Unlike R1\u2019s fluid exploration, O3 functions like a step function\u2014each stage in its reasoning process is discrete and needs to be explicitly defined. This makes it ideal for agent workflows, where consistency and predictability matter. </p>\n<p>Prompts for O3 should be formatted with precision: system prompts defining roles, structured input-output pairs, and explicit step-by-step guidance. Less is more here\u2014clarity beats verbosity, and structure dictates performance.</p>\n<p>O3\u2011Mini excels in coding and agentic workflows, where a structured, predictable response is crucial. It\u2019s better suited for applications requiring function calling, API interactions, or stepwise logical execution\u2014think autonomous software agents handling iterative tasks or generating clean, well-structured code. </p>\n<p>If the task demands a model that can follow a predefined workflow and execute instructions with high reliability, O3 is the better choice.</p>\n<p>DeepSeek R1, by contrast, shines in research-oriented and broader logic tasks. When exploring complex concepts, synthesizing large knowledge bases, or engaging in deep reasoning across multiple disciplines, R1\u2019s open-ended, reflective nature gives it an advantage. </p>\n<p>Its ability to generate expansive thought processes makes it more useful for scientific analysis, theoretical discussions, or creative ideation where insight matters more than strict procedural accuracy.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s worth noting that combining multiple models within a workflow can be even more effective. You might use O3\u2011Mini to structure a complex problem into discrete steps, then pass those outputs into DeepSeek R1 or another model like Qwen for deeper analysis.</p>\n<p>The key is not to assume the same prompting strategies will work across all LLMs\u2014you need to rethink how you structure inputs based on the model\u2019s reasoning process and your desired final outcome.</p><div><br></div><img src=\"https://i.redd.it/emwdhw5eijge1.jpeg\" />",

By making these tools widely accessible and affordable, China isn\u2019t just exporting technology\u2014it\u2019s exporting narratives, ideologies and technical exploits.</p>\n<p>The power of these LLMs lies in their ability to adapt and infiltrate new domains. Their low cost makes them appealing to industries and governments globally, embedding them into infrastructure where they can subtly manipulate information consumption and decision-making. </p>\n<p>The shift from platform-based control to model-based influence represents a seismic change, one that demands scrutiny and safeguards. </p>\n<p>This isn\u2019t just about technology; it\u2019s about who controls the truth.

This will help to avoid any problems with cached data or cookies.</li>\n<li><strong>Log in to your account.</strong> As of now, it seems that you can log in to Sora if you have a ChatGPT Plus or Pro account.\u00a0</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>What if you don\u2019t have a VPN?</strong></p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t have a VPN already, I found this <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/VPN/comments/m736zt/vpn_comparison_table/\">comparison table</a> with quite detailed research. Choose one that suits your budget, as most premium providers should do the trick. In this case, I used NordVPN and it worked well for me.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Possible error message:</strong></p>\n<p>Since a lot of people are trying to log in at the same time, you might run into an error. If that happens, just wait an hour or two and try again - everything should work fine after that.</p>\n<p>I hope this works for you and that you'll be able to try it yourself.</p>",

It\u2019s trivial to us. The same goes for an LLM.</p>\n<p>It can simply output the answer.</p>\n<p>However, asking a question such as \u201cWhat color is the sky across the hours of the day?\u201d is much harder.</p>\n<p>The color will change depending on the weather, the time of day, humidity, and a gazillion other factors. If a human would try to answer this question, she would probably have to break the reasoning into multiple steps.</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How does the color of the sky change when the angle of the sun changes relative to the Earth?</li>\n<li>How does humidity influence this change?</li>\n<li>\u2026</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Then, a human would try to draw upon physical principles to explain each of these effects. Lastly, she would draw general conclusions based on these principles before working herself across different levels of abstraction to come up with a satisfactory answer.</p>\n<p>Boom.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe sky goes from blue to red to black, whereas the red is more pronounced on humid days.\u201d</p>\n<p>This multi-step reasoning is one of the hardest challenges for LLMs to date.</p>\n<p>Most of the errors a model makes on benchmarks happen during this kind of reasoning. Different methods, such as chain-of-though prompting have been used to improve these shortcomings.</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL2FyeGl2Lm9yZy9wZGYvMjMxMC4wNjExNy5wZGY_dXRtX3NvdXJjZT13d3cudGhlZGVjb2RpbmcubmV0JnV0bV9tZWRpdW09cmVmZXJyYWwmdXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPWEtc2ltcGxlLXRyaWNrLXRoYXQtaW1wcm92ZXMtcmVhc29uaW5nLWluLWxsbXMiLCJwb3N0X2lkIjoiMjkzMTJmZWItN2MyOC00N2VmLWI1OGEtMjhmOTM4YjI4MjEyIiwicHVibGljYXRpb25faWQiOiIwMWEzNmYyMC00Y2I5LTQ0ZDAtOTU5MS1lMmM2OWViM2M5NzciLCJ2aXNpdF90b2tlbiI6ImNhZjJiYmQ2LTQzMDUtNDk0My1hOGM5LTIxZWNkNGFjNTk3MSIsImlhdCI6MTcxMjc3MzU3NiwiaXNzIjoib3JjaGlkIn0.wH7mlF1F9PVhBWQOO0G8PgbP1DzyPAoqsh8rEhNjAt0\"><em>recent paper</em></a>, researchers from Google DeepMind proposed to ask so-called step-back questions to improve the model\u2019s reasoning abilities.</p>\n<p>In the following, we will look at how this works and see how we can use it to improve our workflows.</p>\n<h2>What Is A Step-Back Question?</h2>\n<p>The authors define a step-back question as a question at a higher level of abstraction that is derived from the original question.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say we want a model to answer our sky-color question from above. A step-back question would ask the model to provide us with a list of all possible colors the sky can have.</p>\n<p>So far so simple.</p>\n<p>But why is this helpful?</p>\n<p>The authors argue that step-back questions work because it is typically much easier to answer them first to obtain helpful abstractions. Grounding a final answer in these abstractions helps to avoid reasoning errors in intermediate steps.</p>\n<p>Here is how the authors suggest implementing this strategy.</p>\n<h2>How To Do Step-Back Prompting</h2>\n<p>In the paper, the authors suggest to perform two distinct steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Abstraction</strong>: The model is prompted to ask a generic step-back question about the concepts that underlie the original question., such as: \u201cWhat are the physics principles involved in solving this problem?\u201d</li>\n<li><strong>Reasoning</strong>: In this second step, the model is asked the original question. In doing so, it is provided with the output of the step-back prompt. The authors term this step Abstraction-grounded Reasoning because the model can reason about the solution using information about the high-level concept or principle.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Before we wrap up, I would like to emphasize another neat aspect of the paper.</p>\n<h2>Categorizing Errors In Step-Back Results</h2>\n<p>Comparing the results from step-back prompting against the baseline of using the PaLM-2L model shows that the method corrects 20.5% of errors while introducing 11.9% of new ones.</p>\n<p>So, a net positive of 10%.</p>\n<p>To further understand what types of errors were made by the model, the false outputs are annotated. This split the errors into five different classes.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/fae4brvm3ptc1.png?width=914&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57cf71c05297ee834fc30ef88fad45033be13a4f</p>\n<p>Four of the five error types happen during the reasoning step.</p>\n<p>Combined, they make up over 90% of all errors made by the model. Less than 10% of errors are caused by the model creating the wrong abstractions (Principle Error) during step-back prompting.</p>\n<p>So, reasoning remains the bottleneck.</p>\n<p>I would have liked to see a comparison of the error distribution with and without step-back prompting. However, a net reduction in errors of 10% is still great for such a simple method.</p>\n<p>Thank you for reading! I hope this gave you some food for thought. Go ahead and check out the original paper. It\u2019s a fun read.</p>\n<p>Lots of love and speak soon!</p>\n<p>P.s.

In the future, if a very similar prompt is presented, past answers are injected into the prompt as n-shot examples.</p>\n<p>EXISTING: This technique seems obvious but I haven't found any prior implementations, yet.  There are several similar techniques, but no 100% matches.  RAG over chat history can do the same things but this is much more precise and effective.  Reflexion's long-term memory seems very similar or perhaps identical, but I'm not sure.</p>\n<p>MECHANISM: The decision of what to store is based on if the agent had to do multiple tries to get an answer correct (e.g. during reflexion) or if human intervention was required to edit an answer to fix issues.</p>\n<p>USE AS KNOWLEDGE:  Another use for this is pre-populated knowledge.  You could populate the store with pre-made prompts ready for use.  This would likely be a highly effective alternative to fine-tuning.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Is there anything like this?  Is this a sub-component of Reflexion?  Are there standalone implementations?</p>",
