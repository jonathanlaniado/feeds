I washed it three times after and the color seems to be locked in just right. </p>\n<p>Just bought another jacket for like 35 bucks while the blue was 90. This one I will aim for a cool green color.

Having been a fan of the Wicked Good moccasins (old pair above), I was excited. That being said, there were some comments on the quality and these being \u201cMade for Zappos\u201d. Here\u2019s my $0.02:</p>\n<p>These are pretty barebones compared to those sold on the LL Bean website. The 3-piece moccasin stitching looks to be done by a machine whereas the originals have a 2-piece construction that can be done by hand (not all of them are like that. Personally, I prefer the look of the original moc construction. The other major change is the outside. I actually really love the original traction outsole, I\u2019ve never slipped in them and they\u2019re just as good as when I bought them ~3 years ago. This Zappos outsole is a step down. Not a whole lot of traction, I can slide a little on my laminate floors. The compound doesn\u2019t seem as durable either. The last change is the stitching style between the outsole and the upper. Looks like a weird welt, but I don\u2019t foresee any problems with it.</p>\n<p>Other than that, I don\u2019t think there are many other changes. The shearling seems to be from the same origin (Australia) as the originals. Can\u2019t tell if the shade difference is from how worn my old pair is. I think they might\u2019ve sanded down the Zappos pair a little bit more however. Personally, I still think $31 is a steal, just temper your expectations a little.</p>",

The key play here is that trade in for the nano puff vest is $40 and the Proton is $54 at REI. I got both but this makes the Nano Puff the clear winner for me as it meant that I could \"renew\" my old vest for $50. Considering how much I used it, it's a great deal. </p>\n<p><strong>For REI sales in general:</strong> Note that you want to look for the items themselves as <strong>REI's sorting algorithm sometimes leave out mark down when sorted by % off. This means that if you sort by % off, you may miss out on some really good prices.</strong> </p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>",

The SuitSupply portion takes you through the process of speccing out a custom suit and I think it's worth the watch.\n* [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJshLkuOTrw&t=870s)\n\n# Hugo Boss ($500 on sale):\n\nAfter wearing suits from Burlington my entire life, I bought my first nice suit from Nordstrom in 2014. The sales associate pointed me towards Hugo - a trendy, entry level line to the Hugo Boss family. It cost me about $500 and I thought I walked out with a super high quality, name brand suit that would last me ages to come. It wasn't until a few years later when I really looked into the ins and outs of suiting that I realized I had paid for the name on the tag rather than the actual construction of the suit.\n\nI learned that there were three primary types of structured suits: fused, half-canvased, and full canvassed.\n\nThe Boss one I had purchased was a fused suit which meant the inside (typically synthetic) fabric giving it structure and the outer wool was just glued together. This is the most restrictive type of construction because as you move and stretch, the fabric inevitably starts to lift from the glue causing weird bubbles and ripple throughout the jacket. Majority of the suits you see in department stores sub $1000 will be fused since they\u2019re not only easier to produce at scale but much much cheaper.\n\nA fused suit will have a cardboard, boxy like feel that doesn\u2019t drape your body naturally since the fusing is pretty rigid. You\u2019ll notice this especially around the chest and upper back anytime your arms are in motion. The jacket seems to move as a single unit rather than flexing as needed. Heat also becomes an issue as the fusing allows little to no breathability. Details wise, the news does not get much better. You won\u2019t see functional buttons, detail stitching, or a button hole on the lapel. The overly narrow notch lapels prevent it from being a timeless option. While the 100% wool and the fact I had it tailored made it look presentable and wearable, the feel of the wool and the final fit weren\u2019t anything to write home about.\n\nIt\u2019s served well over the years but it\u2019s time to retire this soon as the styling isn\u2019t as timeless with the brighter blue shade and overly narrow lapels. If you slapped a Zara logo on the tag and compared it side by side to one from Zara, I doubt you\u2019d be able to tell a difference based off the construction and styling.\n\n# Suit Supply ($500-$2000):\n\nLet\u2019s move on to Suit Supply. These guys are the go to recommendation for a suit when anyone asks online or on Reddit so I was excited to try my first suit from them. I wanted to go in and try to create a suit as close to my Tom Ford one as I could to see if they could compete so mine came out to $1500. They start at about $500 off the rack and $700 made-to-measure but can go up to around $2000 for a Super150 fabric made to measure three piece suit with all the boxes ticked. The suits across the spectrum are built with the same level of quality and detail the only difference being the fabric, and whether it's half canvassed or fully canvassed.\n\nWith made-to-measure there were three steps: Select your fabric, select your construction/finishings, then get fitted.\n\nI went for a wool/silk blend cream colored fabric (for a summer family wedding), with wide peak lapels, and full canvassing. I opted for a waistcoat and got slightly higher rise pants with the side adjusters to get it as close to the TF one as possible. It was super cool being able to pick out every little aspect of the suit from the inner lining to the buttons to the personalization. I walked through this a bunch more in the video.\n\nWith SuitSupply and especially made-to-measure there, the sales associate you work with will definitely make the biggest difference in the suit. I've had friends and families with bad experiences with the fit because the sales associate didn't know too much about measurements or the types of alterations that are possible once the garment gets in. Thankfully Suit Supply customer service is top notch and they'll take it back for a full refund but definitely try to find the most knowledgable sales associate there. I worked with Aivy at the Houston store and have zero negative things to say. She was super helpful and really knew her stuff!\n\nThe suit itself is made really well, especially for the price point. You get a lot of the details you see with much higher end designers such as the ticket pocket, Milanese button hole, rolling lapel, and the functional button holes. You also have limitless options in terms of colors and fabrics compared to a lot of other suiting brands and they definitely outshine other brands like Indochino and such.\n\nOverall I was really impressed. Suitsupply does a great job at making a suit look a lot more expensive than it is. I really recommend watching this portion of the video as it takes you through the entire process and the small nuggets of info Aivy gives throughout are really helpful.\n\n# TOM FORD:\n\nI bought in 2017 for a close family wedding and I\u2019ve worn it nonstop since then. It is the Windsor cut but we\u2019ll get more into the cuts later.\n\nFrom start to finish, it was an incredible experience. I worked with the same sales associate the entire time making it super easy to text him back and forth for advice and updates. The stock in store is completely different from their stock online and has a lot more options than whats listed on the website. It was my first time buying something of this caliber so the novelty factor probably helped but the service was unmatched. For example, I needed a tie and didn\u2019t want to buy it from TF as they\u2019re quite pricey but the guy helping me bagged it up and walked the suit to a shop across the mall and helped me pick out a tie from a completely different store.\n\nI think the sticker on this was $3800 at the time which was their \u201centry level\u201d option. The only difference in the more expensive models being a higher quality fabric or the addition of a waistcoat. The fabric on the entry level pieces are exceptional so I don\u2019t find the need to splurge in this aspect but a three-piece from Tom Ford is definitely on my fashion bucket list.\n\nIt took a total of 4 fittings to get this tailored perfectly. While other brands I\u2019ve owned give you one fitting and reluctantly agree for a second if you ask for further changes, TF hires some of the best tailors in the game who understand that as you make one large change, smaller changes might come up that need to be tweaked.\n\nThey seek out area that could be better without you having to even tell them and tailor even the most minute details. The cherry on top was the final fitting where everything was perfect except for the rear vent sticking out slightly due to my build. They attached a tiny band of silk connecting one end to the other that fixed the problem right away and looked like it had come that way from the get go. No creases or pulls in sight. Granted, you could also do this to a cheaper suit and an outsourced local tailor but this is the only time I\u2019ve experienced this level of detail for tailoring in a store.\n\nAs I was walking out, suit in hand, the store manager who we got to know really well throughout the process stopped us and handed us a small TF bag and a note that said \u201cCongrats on your first TF suit\u201d. Inside was a 50ml bottle of cologne from their private collection which was an unexpected but super nice touch. Even the customized name plate on the garment bag makes the experience feel special.\n\nStarting with the fabric, all of Tom Ford fabrics are made exclusively for them by Zegna Couture, the highest end of the Zegna range. Even though mine is entry level, its still 100% wool and is made of one of the \"butteriest\" fabrics Ive handled.\n\nThe fit and construction go hand in hand with Tom Ford suits. This is the Windsor or Fit A which is the classic look you think of when you think TF.\n\nAs expected, this is a fully canvased suit but it\u2019s the details that really make it stand out. The 4-5 inch lapels and the addition of the ticket pocket on the right side are the easiest signs when determining if a suit if from TF or not but it\u2019s the subtle details that make the suit. The milanese buttonhole, rolling lapel, the lack of felt under the collar, the barchetta pocket, and the functional button holes all take significantly more time to produce but are tell tell signs of a quality suit with attention paid to the details.\n\nAs cool as these details are, majority of them can be specced with Suit Supply and are not exclusive to TF. You can get a suit from Savile Row or plenty of other brands with the same or better construction and detailing. So what makes a TF suit a TF suit?\n\nIn my opinion it\u2019s how the suit fits and hangs on your body. The traditional TF fit is less a suit you wear but more a suit that wears you in the best way possible. While other suits fit like a glove, I\u2019ve seen this described more so as armor. You almost step into it and it molds you to give you that athletic, broad shoulders, tight waist look even though your body might not be like that underneath.\n\nWhile you might think this fit is exclusive for those with an athletic body type to begin with, the tailors that work at TF might as well be plastic surgeons for how they can make it look like you got a nip and tuck when putting on a tailored TF suit. Sure this fit may not work with every body type but majority do from what I\u2019ve seen with my friends. The high rise pants and the low button set all play into this look.\n\nAs hard as I tried to get the Suit Supply suit to replicate it, I think we fell short in more ways than one. It\u2019s truly a one of a kind suit that just feels different when you slip it on and gives you a level of confidence when wearing it that I haven\u2019t had with any other suiting brand. This suit is insane and it\u2019s honestly one of my favorite things in my closet.\n\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a single thing bad about it except it\u2019s stupid high price point.\n\n# TLDR/Final Thoughts:\n\nIf I was a billionaire, theres no doubt in my mind every suit in my wardrobe would be from TF, however, Suit Supply can take you 90% of the way there at less than half the price. Granted your results are fully dependent on the sales associate you're working with and the knowledge they have on how to measure/tailor your jackets to give you your optimum look.\n\nIn in the meantime however, I\u2019ll be getting my suits from Suit Supply. It\u2019s a no brainer if you\u2019re in the $500-1000 budget. You\u2019re getting stellar construction, a great selection of fabrics, and great options for customizing at a unbeatable price. Avoid the fused designer stuff like the plague though lol\n\nIf you are really into fashion and wear suits a lot, splurging on Tom Ford for your basic, most worn colors, isn't the worst idea. Your navy and charcoal can be from TF and the remainder you can totally get away with being from Suit Supply.\n\nA future video I\u2019d like to make is taking a bone stock Suit Supply suit and having a skilled local tailor work their magic. I wonder if this could get us closer to the TF fit at still half the price while taking the wildcard factor out.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read/watch.

If you guys haven't caught the ones prior, this is where I go out and spend a stupid amount of money on one type of clothing in order to find where the sweet spot lies in terms of price vs quality.  I really enjoy putting these together and reading/replying to all the comments. Hopefully you guys enjoy this one just as much as the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/ithz81/review_i_spent_700_on_sweatsjoggers_to_find_the/\">Joggers</a>,  <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/k09xwx/i_spent_600_on_tshirts_to_find_the_best_one/\">T-Shirt</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/suwuab/20_polo_vs_600_polo_headtohead_review_with_six/\">Polo</a> ones I did a while back.</p>\n<p>The comments in the last post helped me pick the ones to feature this time around. I'm thinking about doing white leather sneakers next but am open to suggestions. Common Projects are a must in this and have been my go to but let me know what other ones to check out.</p>\n<p>For reference, I\u2019m 5\u201910\u201d, 175-180 lbs. These are all a small or medium. I went off the measurements on the size charts.</p>\n<h1>Introduction:</h1>\n<p>Hoodies don't really need much of an introduction but I've been wearing the same two for ages now and decided it was time to upgrade so naturally, spending nearly $1500 on different kinds was the only reasonable way to do so. I tested 7 of these to figure out which is the best hoodie on the market and which of these is the best value for money. We\u2019re going to be looking at how each of these fit, the fabric, the construction and then my overall thoughts.</p>\n<p>I know dropping this in the middle of what feels like is the hottest summer to date isn't the smartest but the off season is the best time to buy to get some of these pieces at competitive prices.</p>\n<h1>Champion</h1>\n<p>First up we have the Champion Reverse Weave Hoodie. This is the OG of hoodies as Champion is credited for inventing them in the 1930s.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fit</strong>:</li>\n<li>This hoodie is a boxy, oversized fit. Although it\u2019s been tweaked since, it was designed to go over football pads in the 1930s. The arms leave a lot of room both in width and in length as you guys can tell by the all bunching. The slight drop shoulder makes it feel nice and relaxed allowing plenty of mobility without feeling like you\u2019re swimming in fabric. The length of the hoodie hits mid crotch and leaves plenty of room in both the chest and stomach area.</li>\n<li><strong>Fabric</strong>:</li>\n<li>The fabric is super thick at 12 ounces and almost coarse feeling when you first unbox it. It feels like a proper old school hoodie. The interior is made of a super soft brushed fleece that does a better job than most at staying that way after being washed. The lining does have a tendency of leaving lint all over whatever you\u2019re wearing under it so might be something to take into account if you\u2019re taking your hoodie on and off frequently.</li>\n<li><strong>Construction</strong>:</li>\n<li>This hoodie is built okay with a ton of loose threads but that\u2019s to be expected. I would say the ribbing details are the stars of the construction. They\u2019re very thick and sturdy. It is seen on the cuff, on the bottom hem, and on the sides. They are nice and tight on the cuff which allow them to stack well on your wrists but are a pain to roll up if you want to wash your hands without getting your hand wet. The drawstrings are hit or miss depending on your preference. While I like a clean finish, I can respect the decision to go with the frayed ends to play into that old school, vintage vibe the hoodie has. The fabric having polyester which has a tendency to piling over time and a few washes.</li>\n<li><strong>Thoughts:</strong></li>\n<li>Overall I\u2019m impressed, at $60 it provides a lot of quality for the value and is regularly seen on sale closer to $40. I wish there was a version that had less branding but it\u2019s nothing I can\u2019t live with.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>American Giant</h1>\n<p>Next up we have American Giant\u2019s Classic Pullover hoodie in Agave Green in a size medium. Right off the bat, this thing oozes quality but more on that later.  I wasn\u2019t familiar with this brand until I started doing research for this video but I\u2019m glad I found it. It\u2019s a Silicon Valley based company that was started to make clothes how they used to be made with a mission to make it all in the States.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fit:</strong></li>\n<li>The fit on the pullover is similar to champion but slightly slimmer. The length of the hoodie is longer and hits the lower crotch when pulled down all the way. The hood on it is massive which I personally love, especially when you\u2019re trying to take a quick nap but it may be annoying to some. The neckline is fairly wide and deep compared to the rest which makes it super easy to get on and off and gives you that pop of contrast with whatever shirt you\u2019re wearing underneath. Where the Champion was a baggy fit, I\u2019d categorized American Giant as a relaxed.</li>\n<li><strong>Fabric:</strong></li>\n<li>The 100% ring spun cotton is nice and soft. It\u2019s a hefty hoodie with its 13 oz fabric. The interior features a weird lining that\u2019s not quite terry but not quite fleece. It's almost a combination of both that provides the softness of fleece but without the shedding.</li>\n<li><strong>Construction:</strong></li>\n<li>This thing is constructed like a tank. The panelling on this hoodie is form meets function at its best. The panels on the elbow make this hoodie feel bulletproof. I really like the wide cuffs and waistband that is tight enough to stay put but not restricting when you choose to roll up your sleeves. The metal tipped drawstrings give is expected at this price point and gives it a clean look.</li>\n<li><strong>Thoughts:</strong></li>\n<li>American Giant definitely lived up to the expectations. I typically throw this one on on colder days when I know I\u2019ll be outside often. At $120, it\u2019s pricey but I think the cost per wear on this one is going to be super low considering it\u2019s built to last a lifetime. I\u2019ve read good things about their customer service and their willingness to replace pieces if anything goes wrong. American Giant has a 20% off promo with email sign up to help a bit with the price. At under $100, it makes it super competitive.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Reigning Champ:</h1>\n<p>Reigning Champ is always in discussion whenever the words \u201cbest hoodie\u201d are tossed around. The Canadian company makes the Midweight Terry Pullover Hoodie in Vancouver. It\u2019s a Reddit favorite so I was stoked to get it in and give it a shot. I got a medium in this khaki colorway.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fit</strong></li>\n<li>I would classify this as a fitted hoodie. Not skin tight but theres minimal excess fabric throughout. The length of this hoodie hits upper to mid crotch and the hood is a normal size. I don\u2019t think theres much room to layer a sweater under this but it works perfectly with the t-shirts that I normally wear. Look into sizing up if you want more of the classic slouchy fit but I went true to size so this hoodie could look good dressed up.</li>\n<li><strong>Fabric</strong></li>\n<li>There are four different fabric textures on this, the main body of the hoodie is a smooth cotton, the cuffs, waistband, and sides are a ribbed elastic, the inner is terry, and the inside of the hood is tightly ribbed but not elastic material. The fabric is 100% preshrunk cotton and hasn\u2019t piled one bit since I received it.</li>\n<li><strong>Construction</strong></li>\n<li>This hoodie is built well with minimal loose threads or other signs of poor workmanship. The flat lock seams give this a deconstructed look and help differentiate the paneling. Some edges of the seams are distressed slightly. The flat tonal drawstrings don\u2019t stand out much giving it a more minimal feel.</li>\n<li><strong>Thoughts</strong></li>\n<li>This is another really good hoodie especially if you\u2019re slimmer and taller. I personally gravitate to this one for chillier indoor spaces and it\u2019s one of my go to\u2019s for spring and fall. At the end of the day it\u2019s a really really good basic but coming in at $145 I think the Asket hoodie may be a better value for a similar hoodie.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Asket</h1>\n<p>Swedish based company, Asked is a favorite of mine and I love what they\u2019re doing in terms of sustainability in fashion. Their basics are unmatched for the most part and I was excited to get this in. The hoodie is made entirely in Portugal and comes 4 colors. This is the Dark Navy Hoodie in a size medium comes in at $120.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fit</strong></li>\n<li>This hoodie is on the slimmer end but not excessively so. I\u2019d say it\u2019s similar to the reigning champ one. The sleeves hit perfectly for me but the length is a tad short landing at the upper crotch. Asket does offer fifteen size combinations ranging from XS to XL and a pick from short, regular or long for length. I\u2019m assuming Asket\u2019s goal was to make this hoodie suited for wearing out versus lounging in hence the fit. You won\u2019t be looking underdressed on your night out when you pair this hoodie with light wash or grey jeans.</li>\n<li><strong>Fabric</strong></li>\n<li>The fabric is unbrushed giving the 100% organic cotton a chance to shine. The inner features a french terry or loopback as Asket like to call it.</li>\n<li><strong>Construction</strong></li>\n<li>The lack of front pocket gives this hoodie a minimal look. I like the look but I find myself instinctively trying to put my phone or wallet in that pocket when I\u2019m out only to be reminded it doesn\u2019t exist. The drawstrings feature a herringbone pattern and are capped with heavy metal tips which ooze quality. The cuffs and hem are made of two layers making them secure but still allowing a but of give to roll your sleeves up.</li>\n<li><strong>Thoughts</strong></li>\n<li>Asket was out to make an elevated, understated hoodie which they did a good job of accomplishing. The lack of pocket, the way it fits, and the colors show that this hoodie is more at home at Sunday brunch than lounging around at home. It comes in at $120 before shipping but I like what it offers. If you\u2019re not into the streetwear or oversized look when you wear a hoodie out, the Asket one provides a dapper alternative.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Lady White Co.</h1>\n<p>I was able to get my hands on two of their hoodies in a size medium: The Classic Fit Hoodie and the Super Weighted Hoodie. While the classic fit one was super nice, I want to focus this review on this weighted one in the deep cement colorway. Lady White Co is an American company that makes everything in Los Angeles.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fit</strong></li>\n<li>This hoodie has that trendy oversized but cropped feel to it. However, they aren\u2019t as short as most cropped hoodies as the length lands upper to mid crotch. They give it that cropped look by making the kangaroo pocket super tall, the top of which almost hits my chest. By using Raglan sleeves, you also get that drop shoulder look without there actually being a shoulder seam. Theres a fine line where oversized fits start looking slouchy but Lady White Co tip toes it perfectly. I really like the look and fit and it\u2019s great for joggers and denim looks.</li>\n<li><strong>Fabric</strong></li>\n<li>This hoodie has an 18oz heavyweight ringspun fabric with a french terry inner. It\u2019s warm when you need it to be but the lack of fleece means you won\u2019t be sweating if you wear it in between seasons. The outer is smooth to the touch it being 100% cotton it shouldn\u2019t pile. It\u2019s stiff when you first get it but it gets softer the more you wear it.</li>\n<li><strong>Construction</strong></li>\n<li>My favorite thing about this hoodie is the way it\u2019s built. Every stitch is impeccable but I especially love the overlocked edge on the hood. It\u2019s a subtle detail but it makes it look so much cleaner.</li>\n<li><strong>Thoughts</strong></li>\n<li>It might be the simplest hoodie here but it\u2019s done extremely well. Coming in at $220 it\u2019s pricey for sure, but if this lasts me 10 years then I don\u2019t mind spending $22 a year to enjoy a hoodie that fits well and is constructed to perfection.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>John Elliott</h2>\n<p>John Elliott is an American designer who is known for his high end, minimal streetwear. The Villain Hoodie is likely JE\u2019s most popular item and was all the rage in 2016 when a ton of celebrities were seen wearing it. I remember wanting this in college but didn\u2019t have that kind of money to spend on clothes so getting this in was exciting for me.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fit</strong></li>\n<li>I got this one off one of John Elliott\u2019s sample sales in a size 3 which is equivalent to a large. I didn\u2019t have a chance to try it on but every review I read said these fit pretty snug so I\u2019m really glad I sized up. The medium would have been skin tight considering the large fits \u201cnormal\u201d. This hoodie is super long hitting my upper quads. The chest is roomy but the stomach area is a bit slim with the zippers almost all the way down. You could always unzip the sides a bit too allow a bit more room if needed but you can\u2019t really go too high without it starting to look funny.</li>\n<li><strong>Fabric</strong></li>\n<li>The fabric on the hoodie is super soft but is the most lightweight of the bunch we have here.</li>\n<li><strong>Construction</strong></li>\n<li>This hoodie is made entirely in Los Angeles and the finishing is superb. The trademark feature of this are the two RiRi zippers on the sides. Just zipping them up and down is super satisfying but they give you the added bonus of loosening or tightening the stomach area. The hidden pockets are also a cool feature but I don\u2019t find myself using them often since you have to pull the zips up to access them. The hood on this is short and wide causing it to look conical once you actually put it up.</li>\n<li><strong>Thoughts</strong></li>\n<li>Although this hoodie is quite dated in terms of style, it felt wrong leaving it off the list just because of how widespread it was just a few years ago. It\u2019s a bit too streetwear for me but I can respect it for what it is. John Elliott did give this a $50 price bump recently with no added features. It\u2019s 268 at retail but a quick google search will show you options as low as 80 from sites like Saks Off Fifth and Nordstrom but even then I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s worth it unless you really want the aesthetic.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Saint Laurent</h2>\n<p>Alrighty, we\u2019re jumping all the way up to $850 for this Saint Laurent Rive Gauche Hoodie. This is practically a uniform for celebrities at the airport but is it worth the price and the hype? To be transparent I bought this one second hand for $250 off of Grailed and opted for a size large.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fit</strong></li>\n<li>Saint Laurent in general tends to fit much slimmer than most other brands and this hoodie is no exception. I had to size up but even then it fits like a very slim medium. I would go up one or two sizes but try to go into a store and try one on if possible. The arms and overall length are both fairly long.</li>\n<li><strong>Fabric</strong></li>\n<li>This is also a 100% cotton hoodie with a coarse terry on the inside. It\u2019s a great year round hoodie that is a good balance between being thin and keeping you warm.</li>\n<li><strong>Construction</strong></li>\n<li>My initial thoughts were \u201cwow, this is super similar to Asket\u201d in terms of construction, everything from the fabric to the metal tips to the cuffs were very similar. The cuffs and hem are also tighter on the Saint Laurent compared to the Asket. The placement of the kangaroo pocket is fairly low and gives the illusion of a longer torso. The reason this hoodie cost so much is for this screen printed logo. That being said I like the how its minimal enough for most people not to notice but if you know, you know.</li>\n<li><strong>Thoughts</strong></li>\n<li>Unless you want a designer hoodie for the flex, I\u2019d skip this one personally. The Asket hoodie gives you 95% of what this one offers and you can get one in each color and still have nearly $400 left over. If you really want the hoodie and want to save some money, sites like Grailed and Saint Laurent facebook groups have them for around 3-400.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Summary:</h1>\n<p>Seven hoodies later let\u2019s wrap it up. None of these were a bad purchase and I think design will play a huge roll as to what people end up choosing. If I were to just rank these for what I gravitate to the most, I\u2019d give Lady White Co the top prize, and tie Asket and American Giant for second because I genuinely can\u2019t decide between the two. The Asket is my go to for wearing out but the American Giant is super comfortable and great with athleisure looks.  Champion would get my third spot, followed by Reigning Champ, John Elliot and Saint Laurent. Only reason I ranked Reigning Champs so low was because I couldn\u2019t justify it at $145 when Asket gives you the same package at $25 less. Keeping budget in mind, although Champion gives you everything you need at $60, if you have the means, splurge a bit and get the American Giant. With the 20% code they provide for email sign ups, the price comes down to $96. For roughly $40 more, I think it will hold up twice as long and the fabric is twice as good.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>I found that I wear the Asket and YSL one when I go out to eat for a casual lunch or dinner and I wear the Lady White Co, American Giant, and Champion ones more on athleisure fits.</p>\n<h1>TLDR/Overall Rank if You Just Want the Best:</h1>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://ladywhiteco.com/products/super-weighted-hoodie-bone\">Lady White Co</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.asket.com/us/mens/sweatshirts/hoodie-dark-navy\">Asket</a> and <a href=\"https://www.american-giant.com/products/mens-classic-pullover-agave-green\">American Giant</a> (Tie)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://shop.reigningchamp.com/products/midweight-terry-pullover-hoodie-desert-rose\">Reigning Champs</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ysl.com/en-us/t-shirts-and-sweatshirts/saint-laurent-rive-gauche-hoodie-677259YB2PG1000.html\">Saint Laurent</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.johnelliott.com/products/hooded-villain-black?clickid=XIB3oY1PVxyITayzgzTfg2XEUkDwb70xU27DX00&amp;utm_source=impact&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_campaign=Sovrn%20Commerce&amp;utm_content=John%20Elliott&amp;irgwc=1\">John Elliott</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3RbYuJS\">Champion</a></li>\n</ol>\n<h1>Budget Friendly Ranking:</h1>\n<ol>\n<li>American Giant - 20% sign up takes it down to under $100. I think it's worth the splurge at that price since it'll last a lot longer than Champion and American Giant stands behind their products.</li>\n<li>Champion - if the logo doesn't bother you, you can get 3-4 of these depending on if they're on sale for the price of one American Giant one.</li>\n<li>Asket</li>\n<li>Reigning Champ -- Asket is cheaper and provides very similar value</li>\n<li>John Elliott</li>\n<li>Saint Laurent - overpriced but you pay for the logo</li>\n</ol>\n<h1><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlGKwiPQbHM&amp;t=456s\">Video</a>:</h1>\n<p>As always, 90% of the info is here but if you want to see a quality video review with more shots of the hoodies and how they fit. I've linked the 15 minute video here.</p>\n<p>None of that typical in your face type content but some quality stuff that takes a bit to produce. The joggers, polo, and t-shirts ones are also in the library somewhere so feel free to check those out.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>*Obviously, this is just my personal opinion based off what I look for. Your order could be the complete opposite and that's okay. Any of these are a solid pick. I'm not expert and just sharing thoughts based on what I like and what I look for. Hope this was somewhat helpful!</p></div>",

Look for prices to start dropping around July 4, analysts say.  </p>\n<p>\u201cThere are going to be discounts like you\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d says Mickey Chadha, a <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/MCO\">Moody\u2019s</a> Investors Service analyst who tracks the retail industry.\u00a0  </p>\n<p>...  </p>\n<p>And if your drawers aren\u2019t already bursting with work-from-home loungewear, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/macys-gap-and-other-clothing-stores-are-stuck-with-the-wrong-items-11654421401?mod=article_inline\">stores will try hard to get you to take it off their shelves</a>. \u201cIt might be a good time to buy sweatpants.

Office wear might not be discounted, he says.\u00a0  </p>\n<p>...  </p>\n<p>Retailers who sell their own lines of clothing and d\u00e9cor, like <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/GPS\">Gap Inc</a>., could be especially inclined to mark down their inventory, Mr. Chadha says, because they can\u2019t pass the cost onto anyone else. (A Gap spokesman says the company is offering sales on seasonal items.) Companies that carry other brands, like Macy\u2019s, can potentially pass some of the surplus back to the producers.\u00a0</p>\n</blockquote></div>",

I was at the store, trying on some cute pants that were advertised as BOGO 50% off. I searched their online store to see if they had more colors because I couldn\u2019t find anymore in stores. Online the pants are On sale AND 40% off!! What?! I got them for half the price I would have paid in store. In fact, everything in my cart was cheaper online. Just had to tell someone about it XD.</p></div>",
