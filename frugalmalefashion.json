Having been a fan of the Wicked Good moccasins (old pair above), I was excited. That being said, there were some comments on the quality and these being \u201cMade for Zappos\u201d. Here\u2019s my $0.02:</p>\n<p>These are pretty barebones compared to those sold on the LL Bean website. The 3-piece moccasin stitching looks to be done by a machine whereas the originals have a 2-piece construction that can be done by hand (not all of them are like that. Personally, I prefer the look of the original moc construction. The other major change is the outside. I actually really love the original traction outsole, I\u2019ve never slipped in them and they\u2019re just as good as when I bought them ~3 years ago. This Zappos outsole is a step down. Not a whole lot of traction, I can slide a little on my laminate floors. The compound doesn\u2019t seem as durable either. The last change is the stitching style between the outsole and the upper. Looks like a weird welt, but I don\u2019t foresee any problems with it.</p>\n<p>Other than that, I don\u2019t think there are many other changes. The shearling seems to be from the same origin (Australia) as the originals. Can\u2019t tell if the shade difference is from how worn my old pair is. I think they might\u2019ve sanded down the Zappos pair a little bit more however. Personally, I still think $31 is a steal, just temper your expectations a little.</p>",

The key play here is that trade in for the nano puff vest is $40 and the Proton is $54 at REI. I got both but this makes the Nano Puff the clear winner for me as it meant that I could \"renew\" my old vest for $50. Considering how much I used it, it's a great deal. </p>\n<p><strong>For REI sales in general:</strong> Note that you want to look for the items themselves as <strong>REI's sorting algorithm sometimes leave out mark down when sorted by % off.

The SuitSupply portion takes you through the process of speccing out a custom suit and I think it's worth the watch.\n* [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJshLkuOTrw&t=870s)\n\n# Hugo Boss ($500 on sale):\n\nAfter wearing suits from Burlington my entire life, I bought my first nice suit from Nordstrom in 2014. The sales associate pointed me towards Hugo - a trendy, entry level line to the Hugo Boss family. It cost me about $500 and I thought I walked out with a super high quality, name brand suit that would last me ages to come. It wasn't until a few years later when I really looked into the ins and outs of suiting that I realized I had paid for the name on the tag rather than the actual construction of the suit.\n\nI learned that there were three primary types of structured suits: fused, half-canvased, and full canvassed.\n\nThe Boss one I had purchased was a fused suit which meant the inside (typically synthetic) fabric giving it structure and the outer wool was just glued together. This is the most restrictive type of construction because as you move and stretch, the fabric inevitably starts to lift from the glue causing weird bubbles and ripple throughout the jacket. Majority of the suits you see in department stores sub $1000 will be fused since they\u2019re not only easier to produce at scale but much much cheaper.\n\nA fused suit will have a cardboard, boxy like feel that doesn\u2019t drape your body naturally since the fusing is pretty rigid. You\u2019ll notice this especially around the chest and upper back anytime your arms are in motion. The jacket seems to move as a single unit rather than flexing as needed. Heat also becomes an issue as the fusing allows little to no breathability. Details wise, the news does not get much better. You won\u2019t see functional buttons, detail stitching, or a button hole on the lapel. The overly narrow notch lapels prevent it from being a timeless option. While the 100% wool and the fact I had it tailored made it look presentable and wearable, the feel of the wool and the final fit weren\u2019t anything to write home about.\n\nIt\u2019s served well over the years but it\u2019s time to retire this soon as the styling isn\u2019t as timeless with the brighter blue shade and overly narrow lapels. If you slapped a Zara logo on the tag and compared it side by side to one from Zara, I doubt you\u2019d be able to tell a difference based off the construction and styling.\n\n# Suit Supply ($500-$2000):\n\nLet\u2019s move on to Suit Supply. These guys are the go to recommendation for a suit when anyone asks online or on Reddit so I was excited to try my first suit from them. I wanted to go in and try to create a suit as close to my Tom Ford one as I could to see if they could compete so mine came out to $1500. They start at about $500 off the rack and $700 made-to-measure but can go up to around $2000 for a Super150 fabric made to measure three piece suit with all the boxes ticked. The suits across the spectrum are built with the same level of quality and detail the only difference being the fabric, and whether it's half canvassed or fully canvassed.\n\nWith made-to-measure there were three steps: Select your fabric, select your construction/finishings, then get fitted.\n\nI went for a wool/silk blend cream colored fabric (for a summer family wedding), with wide peak lapels, and full canvassing. I opted for a waistcoat and got slightly higher rise pants with the side adjusters to get it as close to the TF one as possible. It was super cool being able to pick out every little aspect of the suit from the inner lining to the buttons to the personalization. I walked through this a bunch more in the video.\n\nWith SuitSupply and especially made-to-measure there, the sales associate you work with will definitely make the biggest difference in the suit. I've had friends and families with bad experiences with the fit because the sales associate didn't know too much about measurements or the types of alterations that are possible once the garment gets in. Thankfully Suit Supply customer service is top notch and they'll take it back for a full refund but definitely try to find the most knowledgable sales associate there. I worked with Aivy at the Houston store and have zero negative things to say. She was super helpful and really knew her stuff!\n\nThe suit itself is made really well, especially for the price point. You get a lot of the details you see with much higher end designers such as the ticket pocket, Milanese button hole, rolling lapel, and the functional button holes. You also have limitless options in terms of colors and fabrics compared to a lot of other suiting brands and they definitely outshine other brands like Indochino and such.\n\nOverall I was really impressed. Suitsupply does a great job at making a suit look a lot more expensive than it is. I really recommend watching this portion of the video as it takes you through the entire process and the small nuggets of info Aivy gives throughout are really helpful.\n\n# TOM FORD:\n\nI bought in 2017 for a close family wedding and I\u2019ve worn it nonstop since then. It is the Windsor cut but we\u2019ll get more into the cuts later.\n\nFrom start to finish, it was an incredible experience. I worked with the same sales associate the entire time making it super easy to text him back and forth for advice and updates. The stock in store is completely different from their stock online and has a lot more options than whats listed on the website. It was my first time buying something of this caliber so the novelty factor probably helped but the service was unmatched. For example, I needed a tie and didn\u2019t want to buy it from TF as they\u2019re quite pricey but the guy helping me bagged it up and walked the suit to a shop across the mall and helped me pick out a tie from a completely different store.\n\nI think the sticker on this was $3800 at the time which was their \u201centry level\u201d option. The only difference in the more expensive models being a higher quality fabric or the addition of a waistcoat. The fabric on the entry level pieces are exceptional so I don\u2019t find the need to splurge in this aspect but a three-piece from Tom Ford is definitely on my fashion bucket list.\n\nIt took a total of 4 fittings to get this tailored perfectly. While other brands I\u2019ve owned give you one fitting and reluctantly agree for a second if you ask for further changes, TF hires some of the best tailors in the game who understand that as you make one large change, smaller changes might come up that need to be tweaked.\n\nThey seek out area that could be better without you having to even tell them and tailor even the most minute details. The cherry on top was the final fitting where everything was perfect except for the rear vent sticking out slightly due to my build. They attached a tiny band of silk connecting one end to the other that fixed the problem right away and looked like it had come that way from the get go. No creases or pulls in sight. Granted, you could also do this to a cheaper suit and an outsourced local tailor but this is the only time I\u2019ve experienced this level of detail for tailoring in a store.\n\nAs I was walking out, suit in hand, the store manager who we got to know really well throughout the process stopped us and handed us a small TF bag and a note that said \u201cCongrats on your first TF suit\u201d. Inside was a 50ml bottle of cologne from their private collection which was an unexpected but super nice touch. Even the customized name plate on the garment bag makes the experience feel special.\n\nStarting with the fabric, all of Tom Ford fabrics are made exclusively for them by Zegna Couture, the highest end of the Zegna range. Even though mine is entry level, its still 100% wool and is made of one of the \"butteriest\" fabrics Ive handled.\n\nThe fit and construction go hand in hand with Tom Ford suits. This is the Windsor or Fit A which is the classic look you think of when you think TF.\n\nAs expected, this is a fully canvased suit but it\u2019s the details that really make it stand out. The 4-5 inch lapels and the addition of the ticket pocket on the right side are the easiest signs when determining if a suit if from TF or not but it\u2019s the subtle details that make the suit. The milanese buttonhole, rolling lapel, the lack of felt under the collar, the barchetta pocket, and the functional button holes all take significantly more time to produce but are tell tell signs of a quality suit with attention paid to the details.\n\nAs cool as these details are, majority of them can be specced with Suit Supply and are not exclusive to TF. You can get a suit from Savile Row or plenty of other brands with the same or better construction and detailing. So what makes a TF suit a TF suit?\n\nIn my opinion it\u2019s how the suit fits and hangs on your body. The traditional TF fit is less a suit you wear but more a suit that wears you in the best way possible. While other suits fit like a glove, I\u2019ve seen this described more so as armor. You almost step into it and it molds you to give you that athletic, broad shoulders, tight waist look even though your body might not be like that underneath.\n\nWhile you might think this fit is exclusive for those with an athletic body type to begin with, the tailors that work at TF might as well be plastic surgeons for how they can make it look like you got a nip and tuck when putting on a tailored TF suit. Sure this fit may not work with every body type but majority do from what I\u2019ve seen with my friends. The high rise pants and the low button set all play into this look.\n\nAs hard as I tried to get the Suit Supply suit to replicate it, I think we fell short in more ways than one. It\u2019s truly a one of a kind suit that just feels different when you slip it on and gives you a level of confidence when wearing it that I haven\u2019t had with any other suiting brand. This suit is insane and it\u2019s honestly one of my favorite things in my closet.\n\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a single thing bad about it except it\u2019s stupid high price point.\n\n# TLDR/Final Thoughts:\n\nIf I was a billionaire, theres no doubt in my mind every suit in my wardrobe would be from TF, however, Suit Supply can take you 90% of the way there at less than half the price. Granted your results are fully dependent on the sales associate you're working with and the knowledge they have on how to measure/tailor your jackets to give you your optimum look.\n\nIn in the meantime however, I\u2019ll be getting my suits from Suit Supply. It\u2019s a no brainer if you\u2019re in the $500-1000 budget. You\u2019re getting stellar construction, a great selection of fabrics, and great options for customizing at a unbeatable price. Avoid the fused designer stuff like the plague though lol\n\nIf you are really into fashion and wear suits a lot, splurging on Tom Ford for your basic, most worn colors, isn't the worst idea. Your navy and charcoal can be from TF and the remainder you can totally get away with being from Suit Supply.\n\nA future video I\u2019d like to make is taking a bone stock Suit Supply suit and having a skilled local tailor work their magic. I wonder if this could get us closer to the TF fit at still half the price while taking the wildcard factor out.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read/watch. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/xezhkT8](https://imgur.com/a/xezhkT8)<div><br></div><div><p>I have now experienced suits from across the price spectrum so figured a post would be worth my time so you guys can avoid the same mistakes I've made and save some money.</p>\n<h1>Video:</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>All the info is on this post but this is one of my best videos to date. The SuitSupply portion takes you through the process of speccing out a custom suit and I think it's worth the watch.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJshLkuOTrw&amp;t=870s\">Link</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Hugo Boss ($500 on sale):</h1>\n<p>After wearing suits from Burlington my entire life, I bought my first nice suit from Nordstrom in 2014. The sales associate pointed me towards Hugo - a trendy, entry level line to the Hugo Boss family. It cost me about $500 and I thought I walked out with a super high quality, name brand suit that would last me ages to come. It wasn't until a few years later when I really looked into the ins and outs of suiting that I realized I had paid for the name on the tag rather than the actual construction of the suit.</p>\n<p>I learned that there were three primary types of structured suits: fused, half-canvased, and full canvassed.</p>\n<p>The Boss one I had purchased was a fused suit which meant the inside (typically synthetic) fabric giving it structure and the outer wool was just glued together. This is the most restrictive type of construction because as you move and stretch, the fabric inevitably starts to lift from the glue causing weird bubbles and ripple throughout the jacket. Majority of the suits you see in department stores sub $1000 will be fused since they\u2019re not only easier to produce at scale but much much cheaper.</p>\n<p>A fused suit will have a cardboard, boxy like feel that doesn\u2019t drape your body naturally since the fusing is pretty rigid. You\u2019ll notice this especially around the chest and upper back anytime your arms are in motion. The jacket seems to move as a single unit rather than flexing as needed. Heat also becomes an issue as the fusing allows little to no breathability. Details wise, the news does not get much better. You won\u2019t see functional buttons, detail stitching, or a button hole on the lapel. The overly narrow notch lapels prevent it from being a timeless option. While the 100% wool and the fact I had it tailored made it look presentable and wearable, the feel of the wool and the final fit weren\u2019t anything to write home about.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s served well over the years but it\u2019s time to retire this soon as the styling isn\u2019t as timeless with the brighter blue shade and overly narrow lapels.

If you guys haven't caught the ones prior, this is where I go out and spend a stupid amount of money on one type of clothing in order to find where the sweet spot lies in terms of price vs quality.  I really enjoy putting these together and reading/replying to all the comments. Hopefully you guys enjoy this one just as much as the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/ithz81/review_i_spent_700_on_sweatsjoggers_to_find_the/\">Joggers</a>,  <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/k09xwx/i_spent_600_on_tshirts_to_find_the_best_one/\">T-Shirt</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/suwuab/20_polo_vs_600_polo_headtohead_review_with_six/\">Polo</a> ones I did a while back.</p>\n<p>The comments in the last post helped me pick the ones to feature this time around. I'm thinking about doing white leather sneakers next but am open to suggestions. Common Projects are a must in this and have been my go to but let me know what other ones to check out.</p>\n<p>For reference, I\u2019m 5\u201910\u201d, 175-180 lbs. These are all a small or medium. I went off the measurements on the size charts.</p>\n<h1>Introduction:</h1>\n<p>Hoodies don't really need much of an introduction but I've been wearing the same two for ages now and decided it was time to upgrade so naturally, spending nearly $1500 on different kinds was the only reasonable way to do so. I tested 7 of these to figure out which is the best hoodie on the market and which of these is the best value for money. We\u2019re going to be looking at how each of these fit, the fabric, the construction and then my overall thoughts.</p>\n<p>I know dropping this in the middle of what feels like is the hottest summer to date isn't the smartest but the off season is the best time to buy to get some of these pieces at competitive prices.</p>\n<h1>Champion</h1>\n<p>First up we have the Champion Reverse Weave Hoodie. This is the OG of hoodies as Champion is credited for inventing them in the 1930s.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fit</strong>:</li>\n<li>This hoodie is a boxy, oversized fit. Although it\u2019s been tweaked since, it was designed to go over football pads in the 1930s. The arms leave a lot of room both in width and in length as you guys can tell by the all bunching. The slight drop shoulder makes it feel nice and relaxed allowing plenty of mobility without feeling like you\u2019re swimming in fabric. The length of the hoodie hits mid crotch and leaves plenty of room in both the chest and stomach area.</li>\n<li><strong>Fabric</strong>:</li>\n<li>The fabric is super thick at 12 ounces and almost coarse feeling when you first unbox it. It feels like a proper old school hoodie. The interior is made of a super soft brushed fleece that does a better job than most at staying that way after being washed. The lining does have a tendency of leaving lint all over whatever you\u2019re wearing under it so might be something to take into account if you\u2019re taking your hoodie on and off frequently.</li>\n<li><strong>Construction</strong>:</li>\n<li>This hoodie is built okay with a ton of loose threads but that\u2019s to be expected. I would say the ribbing details are the stars of the construction. They\u2019re very thick and sturdy. It is seen on the cuff, on the bottom hem, and on the sides. They are nice and tight on the cuff which allow them to stack well on your wrists but are a pain to roll up if you want to wash your hands without getting your hand wet. The drawstrings are hit or miss depending on your preference. While I like a clean finish, I can respect the decision to go with the frayed ends to play into that old school, vintage vibe the hoodie has. The fabric having polyester which has a tendency to piling over time and a few washes.</li>\n<li><strong>Thoughts:</strong></li>\n<li>Overall I\u2019m impressed, at $60 it provides a lot of quality for the value and is regularly seen on sale closer to $40. I wish there was a version that had less branding but it\u2019s nothing I can\u2019t live with.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>American Giant</h1>\n<p>Next up we have American Giant\u2019s Classic Pullover hoodie in Agave Green in a size medium. Right off the bat, this thing oozes quality but more on that later.  I wasn\u2019t familiar with this brand until I started doing research for this video but I\u2019m glad I found it. It\u2019s a Silicon Valley based company that was started to make clothes how they used to be made with a mission to make it all in the States.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fit:</strong></li>\n<li>The fit on the pullover is similar to champion but slightly slimmer. The length of the hoodie is longer and hits the lower crotch when pulled down all the way. The hood on it is massive which I personally love, especially when you\u2019re trying to take a quick nap but it may be annoying to some. The neckline is fairly wide and deep compared to the rest which makes it super easy to get on and off and gives you that pop of contrast with whatever shirt you\u2019re wearing underneath. Where the Champion was a baggy fit, I\u2019d categorized American Giant as a relaxed.</li>\n<li><strong>Fabric:</strong></li>\n<li>The 100% ring spun cotton is nice and soft. It\u2019s a hefty hoodie with its 13 oz fabric. The interior features a weird lining that\u2019s not quite terry but not quite fleece. It's almost a combination of both that provides the softness of fleece but without the shedding.</li>\n<li><strong>Construction:</strong></li>\n<li>This thing is constructed like a tank. The panelling on this hoodie is form meets function at its best. The panels on the elbow make this hoodie feel bulletproof. I really like the wide cuffs and waistband that is tight enough to stay put but not restricting when you choose to roll up your sleeves. The metal tipped drawstrings give is expected at this price point and gives it a clean look.</li>\n<li><strong>Thoughts:</strong></li>\n<li>American Giant definitely lived up to the expectations. I typically throw this one on on colder days when I know I\u2019ll be outside often. At $120, it\u2019s pricey but I think the cost per wear on this one is going to be super low considering it\u2019s built to last a lifetime. I\u2019ve read good things about their customer service and their willingness to replace pieces if anything goes wrong. American Giant has a 20% off promo with email sign up to help a bit with the price. At under $100, it makes it super competitive.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Reigning Champ:</h1>\n<p>Reigning Champ is always in discussion whenever the words \u201cbest hoodie\u201d are tossed around. The Canadian company makes the Midweight Terry Pullover Hoodie in Vancouver. It\u2019s a Reddit favorite so I was stoked to get it in and give it a shot. I got a medium in this khaki colorway.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fit</strong></li>\n<li>I would classify this as a fitted hoodie. Not skin tight but theres minimal excess fabric throughout. The length of this hoodie hits upper to mid crotch and the hood is a normal size. I don\u2019t think theres much room to layer a sweater under this but it works perfectly with the t-shirts that I normally wear. Look into sizing up if you want more of the classic slouchy fit but I went true to size so this hoodie could look good dressed up.</li>\n<li><strong>Fabric</strong></li>\n<li>There are four different fabric textures on this, the main body of the hoodie is a smooth cotton, the cuffs, waistband, and sides are a ribbed elastic, the inner is terry, and the inside of the hood is tightly ribbed but not elastic material. The fabric is 100% preshrunk cotton and hasn\u2019t piled one bit since I received it.</li>\n<li><strong>Construction</strong></li>\n<li>This hoodie is built well with minimal loose threads or other signs of poor workmanship. The flat lock seams give this a deconstructed look and help differentiate the paneling. Some edges of the seams are distressed slightly. The flat tonal drawstrings don\u2019t stand out much giving it a more minimal feel.</li>\n<li><strong>Thoughts</strong></li>\n<li>This is another really good hoodie especially if you\u2019re slimmer and taller. I personally gravitate to this one for chillier indoor spaces and it\u2019s one of my go to\u2019s for spring and fall. At the end of the day it\u2019s a really really good basic but coming in at $145 I think the Asket hoodie may be a better value for a similar hoodie.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Asket</h1>\n<p>Swedish based company, Asked is a favorite of mine and I love what they\u2019re doing in terms of sustainability in fashion. Their basics are unmatched for the most part and I was excited to get this in. The hoodie is made entirely in Portugal and comes 4 colors. This is the Dark Navy Hoodie in a size medium comes in at $120.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fit</strong></li>\n<li>This hoodie is on the slimmer end but not excessively so. I\u2019d say it\u2019s similar to the reigning champ one. The sleeves hit perfectly for me but the length is a tad short landing at the upper crotch. Asket does offer fifteen size combinations ranging from XS to XL and a pick from short, regular or long for length. I\u2019m assuming Asket\u2019s goal was to make this hoodie suited for wearing out versus lounging in hence the fit. You won\u2019t be looking underdressed on your night out when you pair this hoodie with light wash or grey jeans.</li>\n<li><strong>Fabric</strong></li>\n<li>The fabric is unbrushed giving the 100% organic cotton a chance to shine. The inner features a french terry or loopback as Asket like to call it.</li>\n<li><strong>Construction</strong></li>\n<li>The lack of front pocket gives this hoodie a minimal look. I like the look but I find myself instinctively trying to put my phone or wallet in that pocket when I\u2019m out only to be reminded it doesn\u2019t exist. The drawstrings feature a herringbone pattern and are capped with heavy metal tips which ooze quality. The cuffs and hem are made of two layers making them secure but still allowing a but of give to roll your sleeves up.</li>\n<li><strong>Thoughts</strong></li>\n<li>Asket was out to make an elevated, understated hoodie which they did a good job of accomplishing. The lack of pocket, the way it fits, and the colors show that this hoodie is more at home at Sunday brunch than lounging around at home. It comes in at $120 before shipping but I like what it offers. If you\u2019re not into the streetwear or oversized look when you wear a hoodie out, the Asket one provides a dapper alternative.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Lady White Co.</h1>\n<p>I was able to get my hands on two of their hoodies in a size medium: The Classic Fit Hoodie and the Super Weighted Hoodie. While the classic fit one was super nice, I want to focus this review on this weighted one in the deep cement colorway. Lady White Co is an American company that makes everything in Los Angeles.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fit</strong></li>\n<li>This hoodie has that trendy oversized but cropped feel to it. However, they aren\u2019t as short as most cropped hoodies as the length lands upper to mid crotch. They give it that cropped look by making the kangaroo pocket super tall, the top of which almost hits my chest. By using Raglan sleeves, you also get that drop shoulder look without there actually being a shoulder seam. Theres a fine line where oversized fits start looking slouchy but Lady White Co tip toes it perfectly. I really like the look and fit and it\u2019s great for joggers and denim looks.</li>\n<li><strong>Fabric</strong></li>\n<li>This hoodie has an 18oz heavyweight ringspun fabric with a french terry inner. It\u2019s warm when you need it to be but the lack of fleece means you won\u2019t be sweating if you wear it in between seasons. The outer is smooth to the touch it being 100% cotton it shouldn\u2019t pile. It\u2019s stiff when you first get it but it gets softer the more you wear it.</li>\n<li><strong>Construction</strong></li>\n<li>My favorite thing about this hoodie is the way it\u2019s built. Every stitch is impeccable but I especially love the overlocked edge on the hood. It\u2019s a subtle detail but it makes it look so much cleaner.</li>\n<li><strong>Thoughts</strong></li>\n<li>It might be the simplest hoodie here but it\u2019s done extremely well. Coming in at $220 it\u2019s pricey for sure, but if this lasts me 10 years then I don\u2019t mind spending $22 a year to enjoy a hoodie that fits well and is constructed to perfection.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>John Elliott</h2>\n<p>John Elliott is an American designer who is known for his high end, minimal streetwear. The Villain Hoodie is likely JE\u2019s most popular item and was all the rage in 2016 when a ton of celebrities were seen wearing it. I remember wanting this in college but didn\u2019t have that kind of money to spend on clothes so getting this in was exciting for me.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fit</strong></li>\n<li>I got this one off one of John Elliott\u2019s sample sales in a size 3 which is equivalent to a large. I didn\u2019t have a chance to try it on but every review I read said these fit pretty snug so I\u2019m really glad I sized up. The medium would have been skin tight considering the large fits \u201cnormal\u201d. This hoodie is super long hitting my upper quads. The chest is roomy but the stomach area is a bit slim with the zippers almost all the way down. You could always unzip the sides a bit too allow a bit more room if needed but you can\u2019t really go too high without it starting to look funny.</li>\n<li><strong>Fabric</strong></li>\n<li>The fabric on the hoodie is super soft but is the most lightweight of the bunch we have here.</li>\n<li><strong>Construction</strong></li>\n<li>This hoodie is made entirely in Los Angeles and the finishing is superb. The trademark feature of this are the two RiRi zippers on the sides. Just zipping them up and down is super satisfying but they give you the added bonus of loosening or tightening the stomach area. The hidden pockets are also a cool feature but I don\u2019t find myself using them often since you have to pull the zips up to access them. The hood on this is short and wide causing it to look conical once you actually put it up.</li>\n<li><strong>Thoughts</strong></li>\n<li>Although this hoodie is quite dated in terms of style, it felt wrong leaving it off the list just because of how widespread it was just a few years ago. It\u2019s a bit too streetwear for me but I can respect it for what it is. John Elliott did give this a $50 price bump recently with no added features. It\u2019s 268 at retail but a quick google search will show you options as low as 80 from sites like Saks Off Fifth and Nordstrom but even then I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s worth it unless you really want the aesthetic.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Saint Laurent</h2>\n<p>Alrighty, we\u2019re jumping all the way up to $850 for this Saint Laurent Rive Gauche Hoodie. This is practically a uniform for celebrities at the airport but is it worth the price and the hype? To be transparent I bought this one second hand for $250 off of Grailed and opted for a size large.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fit</strong></li>\n<li>Saint Laurent in general tends to fit much slimmer than most other brands and this hoodie is no exception. I had to size up but even then it fits like a very slim medium. I would go up one or two sizes but try to go into a store and try one on if possible. The arms and overall length are both fairly long.</li>\n<li><strong>Fabric</strong></li>\n<li>This is also a 100% cotton hoodie with a coarse terry on the inside. It\u2019s a great year round hoodie that is a good balance between being thin and keeping you warm.</li>\n<li><strong>Construction</strong></li>\n<li>My initial thoughts were \u201cwow, this is super similar to Asket\u201d in terms of construction, everything from the fabric to the metal tips to the cuffs were very similar. The cuffs and hem are also tighter on the Saint Laurent compared to the Asket. The placement of the kangaroo pocket is fairly low and gives the illusion of a longer torso. The reason this hoodie cost so much is for this screen printed logo. That being said I like the how its minimal enough for most people not to notice but if you know, you know.</li>\n<li><strong>Thoughts</strong></li>\n<li>Unless you want a designer hoodie for the flex, I\u2019d skip this one personally. The Asket hoodie gives you 95% of what this one offers and you can get one in each color and still have nearly $400 left over. If you really want the hoodie and want to save some money, sites like Grailed and Saint Laurent facebook groups have them for around 3-400.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Summary:</h1>\n<p>Seven hoodies later let\u2019s wrap it up. None of these were a bad purchase and I think design will play a huge roll as to what people end up choosing. If I were to just rank these for what I gravitate to the most, I\u2019d give Lady White Co the top prize, and tie Asket and American Giant for second because I genuinely can\u2019t decide between the two. The Asket is my go to for wearing out but the American Giant is super comfortable and great with athleisure looks.  Champion would get my third spot, followed by Reigning Champ, John Elliot and Saint Laurent. Only reason I ranked Reigning Champs so low was because I couldn\u2019t justify it at $145 when Asket gives you the same package at $25 less. Keeping budget in mind, although Champion gives you everything you need at $60, if you have the means, splurge a bit and get the American Giant. With the 20% code they provide for email sign ups, the price comes down to $96. For roughly $40 more, I think it will hold up twice as long and the fabric is twice as good.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>I found that I wear the Asket and YSL one when I go out to eat for a casual lunch or dinner and I wear the Lady White Co, American Giant, and Champion ones more on athleisure fits.</p>\n<h1>TLDR/Overall Rank if You Just Want the Best:</h1>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://ladywhiteco.com/products/super-weighted-hoodie-bone\">Lady White Co</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.asket.com/us/mens/sweatshirts/hoodie-dark-navy\">Asket</a> and <a href=\"https://www.american-giant.com/products/mens-classic-pullover-agave-green\">American Giant</a> (Tie)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://shop.reigningchamp.com/products/midweight-terry-pullover-hoodie-desert-rose\">Reigning Champs</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ysl.com/en-us/t-shirts-and-sweatshirts/saint-laurent-rive-gauche-hoodie-677259YB2PG1000.html\">Saint Laurent</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.johnelliott.com/products/hooded-villain-black?clickid=XIB3oY1PVxyITayzgzTfg2XEUkDwb70xU27DX00&amp;utm_source=impact&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_campaign=Sovrn%20Commerce&amp;utm_content=John%20Elliott&amp;irgwc=1\">John Elliott</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3RbYuJS\">Champion</a></li>\n</ol>\n<h1>Budget Friendly Ranking:</h1>\n<ol>\n<li>American Giant - 20% sign up takes it down to under $100. I think it's worth the splurge at that price since it'll last a lot longer than Champion and American Giant stands behind their products.</li>\n<li>Champion - if the logo doesn't bother you, you can get 3-4 of these depending on if they're on sale for the price of one American Giant one.</li>\n<li>Asket</li>\n<li>Reigning Champ -- Asket is cheaper and provides very similar value</li>\n<li>John Elliott</li>\n<li>Saint Laurent - overpriced but you pay for the logo</li>\n</ol>\n<h1><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlGKwiPQbHM&amp;t=456s\">Video</a>:</h1>\n<p>As always, 90% of the info is here but if you want to see a quality video review with more shots of the hoodies and how they fit. I've linked the 15 minute video here.</p>\n<p>None of that typical in your face type content but some quality stuff that takes a bit to produce. The joggers, polo, and t-shirts ones are also in the library somewhere so feel free to check those out.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>*Obviously, this is just my personal opinion based off what I look for. Your order could be the complete opposite and that's okay. Any of these are a solid pick. I'm not expert and just sharing thoughts based on what I like and what I look for. Hope this was somewhat helpful!</p></div>",

Look for prices to start dropping around July 4, analysts say.  </p>\n<p>\u201cThere are going to be discounts like you\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d says Mickey Chadha, a <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/MCO\">Moody\u2019s</a> Investors Service analyst who tracks the retail industry.\u00a0  </p>\n<p>...  </p>\n<p>And if your drawers aren\u2019t already bursting with work-from-home loungewear, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/macys-gap-and-other-clothing-stores-are-stuck-with-the-wrong-items-11654421401?mod=article_inline\">stores will try hard to get you to take it off their shelves</a>. \u201cIt might be a good time to buy sweatpants.

Office wear might not be discounted, he says.\u00a0  </p>\n<p>...  </p>\n<p>Retailers who sell their own lines of clothing and d\u00e9cor, like <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/GPS\">Gap Inc</a>., could be especially inclined to mark down their inventory, Mr. Chadha says, because they can\u2019t pass the cost onto anyone else. (A Gap spokesman says the company is offering sales on seasonal items.) Companies that carry other brands, like Macy\u2019s, can potentially pass some of the surplus back to the producers.\u00a0</p>\n</blockquote></div>",

I was at the store, trying on some cute pants that were advertised as BOGO 50% off. I searched their online store to see if they had more colors because I couldn\u2019t find anymore in stores. Online the pants are On sale AND 40% off!! What?! I got them for half the price I would have paid in store. In fact, everything in my cart was cheaper online. Just had to tell someone about it XD.</p></div>",

They're made of softer material are very easy to move around in.\nIf you have bigger thighs and legs in general, these will look even better on you because they are very roomy.\nThe material is not as stiff as their chino counterparts. Overall a great casual short for summer.</p>\n<h1>Bonobos Stretch Washed Chino Shorts:</h1>\n<p>My absolute favorite of the bunch. The material is very nice but doesn't feel restricting or too stiff at all.\nI love the style, it doesn't billow out at all which is a huge plus for me. It's also the shortest of the shorts so if you got muscular thighs and calves\nthese would look great on you. These definitley make me want to up my squat game in the gym.</p>\n<h1>Volcom Frickin Chino Short:</h1>\n<p>Overall a decent, modest summer short. Good solid material, but it billowed out on the bottoms a bit too much for my liking. Again, I'd recommend this pair if you have bigger thighs and legs in general and prefer a regular style of shorts.</p>\n<h1>Dockers Classic Fit Perfect Short:</h1>\n<p>Overall I'd say these shorts had what I percieved to be the most high quality construction. The material was really thick and solid, and a bit stiff too. It's hard to imagine not keeping these shorts for years.\nThe fit is also suprisingly decent, not much billowing at the bottom and pretty roomy without looking too baggy. I'd say for the average guy, these shorts are perfect.</p>\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>I liked all of these shorts but the Bonobos shorts were by far my favorite, I think I just prefer shorter shorts in general because they offset the look of my skinny calves.</p>\n<p>Hope this was of some help to you guys.</p></div>",

For this post I try on and review 10 high-end joggers. What\u2019s high-end? Well joggers that are around $100 dollars or more.</p>\n<p>Last week I made a post on 10 budget joggers, those are around $40 or less. So if you don\u2019t want to spend your entire paycheck on one of these pairs, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/menshauls/comments/t28d8f/review_best_joggers_under_40/\">check out that post</a>. There are some really great and affordable options there.</p>\n<p>For reference, I\u2019m 5\u20199 and 190 pounds. My pants size is 33x32 and all joggers in this haul are size Large.</p>\n<h1><a href=\"https://youtu.be/MA8n-nFflJ8\">Video</a></h1>\n<p>As always, here's a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/MA8n-nFflJ8\">video</a> that goes along with this review. But I don't post this to shill my YT channel. Instead I want people to see that I personally try on all joggers and that this review is genuine and  not just a random list of joggers I've found online. Also if people want to see what these joggers look like on someone my size they can watch the video too. I personally prefer videos over images when buying stuff and I think others will like it too.</p>\n<p>Enough talking, here's the details for each pair:</p>\n<h1>[Best Overall] Lululemon City Sweat Joggers - $118</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Made from 52% polyester, 42% cotton and 6% lycra</li>\n<li>Can\u2019t get any better than these. Seriously, to me, these are everything that I\u2019m looking for in a pair of joggers. They are super soft and comfortable, they fit really well, they have some structure to them so they are versatile, I can wear them at home, at the gym, when traveling. I just love these. They fit slime to the leg but not too tight so you get that nice clean and tapered look. Also the fabric on these is the perfect blend between cotton and polyester, it's natural but also feels strong and durable. If you like these but don\u2019t want to spend $120, check the Uniqlos from my other post. they are very similar. I reviewed those in my other video but those are equivalent sweatpants on a budget.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Reigning Champ Slim Sweatpant - $120</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Mae from 100% cotton</li>\n<li>Right off the bat these feel very similar to the Goodthreads ones I reviewed in my budget joggers post. These are $120 and those are only $27. Now these are made in Canada and you can tell the craftsmanship and attention to detail is superior, especially the stitching. They are heavyweight and you can just tell they are high quality. The fit on these is a bit slimmer than most joggers, they make my legs skinnier. These are good sweatpants and high quality, but personally if I\u2019m being totally honest,  I\u2019d pick the $27 Goodthreads over these. I think they are too similar, and for $100 difference I don\u2019t think it justifies the price. But if you want something that's high quality, that will last a long time and you have the money to spend, then the Reigning Champ are a good option.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Vuori Sunday performance - $89</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Made from 88% polyester and 12% elastane</li>\n<li>These are very stretchy. They are definitely performance joggers that are made for running and being active in general. Personally I don\u2019t like the synthetic feel of polyester, so these are not for me. Also they don\u2019t have very much structure to them, so I wouldn\u2019t wear them outside the house very much, maybe only to the gym. Also they hug my calves a little too tight, there\u2019s too much taper there and I can feel them around my calves. Personally I prefer joggers that are more versatile, so these don\u2019t really fit my lifestyle and I\u2019ll return them.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Western Rise Spectrum Jogger - $128</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Made from 100% polyester</li>\n<li>First thing, these guys charge for shipping and I feel like if I\u2019m spending $128 for a pair of joggers, shipping better be free. All other brands offer free shipping. So right off the bat, the customer experience  put a bad taste in my mouth. As far as the joggers go, the material feels techy but they don\u2019t really fit me. They are way too long in the bottom and they are kind of baggy in general. Also they ride up my thighs weirdly. The whole crotch area just seems off for some reason. I didn\u2019t really love these joggers, and for $128 for 100% polyester I think these are overpriced so I returned them.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>[Best Structured] Lululemon ABC jogger - $128</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Made from their warpstreme fabric, which is 53% elastomultiester and 47% polyester.</li>\n<li>Just like the Lululemon City Sweat, these are extremely well made joggers. The way they feel and the way they look, you can tell it\u2019s a premier sweatpant. The price of $128 is steep, but I think it\u2019s totally justified. Out of the entire haul, I think Lululemons were the only joggers where I think the price was justified, they feel like the best quality by far. Now these joggers feel a lot more technical than the City Sweat joggers, there is more of that synthetic feel to them. But I still like how they feel when I put them on. As far as the fit, these are just slightly too long in the bottom, and also the waist is not very stretch so when I put them on I have to work a little harder. But it\u2019s not a big deal, once I have them on I think they look great and they are comfortable. They have a very structured look to them. These are definitely more dressed up and formal joggers and can be worn, at home, outside, to the gym. You can probably pull these off even in the office, but only If you\u2019re a software engineer or designer, one of the creative types. I was on the fence, I really really liked these and I was going to keep them until I tried the Olivers below. But I think these are amazing joggers and I definitely would recommend them.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Everlane Renew Air Pant</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>$68 and made of 86% polyester and 14% elastane</li>\n<li>These feel and look very similar to the Vuoris, except that they are $20 cheaper. These are a little more loose and a little more baggy than the Vuoris, but other than that it feels like the exact same jogger. These are very unstructured, but I prefer more structure on the joggers, I like them to look and feel more sharp instead of so casual and relaxed. Also I don\u2019t love polyester and I prefer cotton blends or something more breathable.  But the polyester has its benefits,  they\u2019ll last forever, they don\u2019t wrinkle, they won\u2019t shrink and  they are good for running or exercising. But I don\u2019t run and when I do, I prefer to do it in shorts. So I think these are okay, but not for me. I\u2019ll return them</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Mac Weldon Ace Sweatpant - $78</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Made from 95% cotton and 5% spandex</li>\n<li>These are my second most favorite pair of joggers in this Haul. These are really really nice. They are super comfortable, they fit close to the leg but they are stretchy and breathable. Also they are silm and tapered and they look very sharp when I have these on.  I don\u2019t know how they hold up, but at first impression they feel like premium quality. And at $78 they are the most reasonably priced joggers in this Haul. They use micro-brushed french terry, which I have no idea what it is, but it\u2019s really soft so I like it. At the bottom they\u2019re not really cuffed, it\u2019s more like a taper but it\u2019s okay for me, I don\u2019t have a preference either way. They do have a random side pocket which I have no idea what I would ever use it for, it\u2019s too small for a phone and just kind of sits there awkwardly. My only issue with these is how they fit in the thighs. I have big thighs so these are too tight in that area, and when I wash them and they shrink I know that they will not fit me very well. So I\u2019m bummed out and I wish I could keep these, but because of how they fit my legs I would return them. But if you have smaller thighs I would recommend these $100, they are awesome!</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>[Best Structured] Olivers Bradburry Jogger - $118</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Made from 88% Nylon and 12% elastane</li>\n<li>Don\u2019t know what it was about these joggers, but as soon as I put them on I knew I\u2019d be keeping them. The fit on them is perfect and also the material great too. Just this weekend we went out to a brewery and I wore these and I already got tons of compliments. They are 88/% Nylon so they are still synthetic but they still feel really good, very breathable and they don\u2019t get in the way. These and Lulu ABCs are the only two structured joggers I liked. They are very similar, but ultimately I decided on these because the Lulus are more heavyweight material and with spring and summer the Olivers are way more practical. Also the fit on these is better. So while they are $118, I feel guilty even saying it,  they are 100% worth it in my mind. I ended up keeping these and I\u2019m super happy with them.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Public Rec All Day Everyday Jogger - $108</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Made of 88% nylon and 12% spandex.</li>\n<li>These joggers feel really soft. But I don\u2019t like how they fit. They are way too tight all around, too tight in the waist, too long in the bottom. Also to me, they look and feel very similar to the Mac Weldons, but the Mac Weldons use cotton and they fit better and they are also $30 cheaper. So I ended up returning these because they didn\u2019t fit me, and for the same price the Mac Weldons are a far better deal.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Outdoor Voices All Day Sweatpant - $88</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Made of 94% Polyester, 6% Spandex</li>\n<li>So these never came in the mail, they were stuck somewhere in Sacramento, CA. But even if they did, I\u2019m pretty sure I would not have kept them. After trying on so many joggers I know that I don\u2019t like the polyester fabric on these and they would not have been for me. These are in the same class as the Vuoris and the Everlanes, and while they have their use, they don\u2019t fit my lifestyle so I will probably have returned them.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Well that was it. Ultimately, out of 20 joggers I tried, I decided to keep 4 pairs. It wasn\u2019t an easy decision, there were some great joggers in here, they\u2019re affordable and they\u2019re comfortable. But here\u2019s the ones I picked for myself:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Lululemon City Sweat Jogger</li>\n<li>The Olivers Bradburry</li>\n<li>The Zara Knit Sweatpant [Budget Joggers Haul]</li>\n<li>and the Hanes EcoSmart [Budget Joggers Haul]</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>Recommendations</h1>\n<p>After doing this for 20 joggers, here\u2019s the ones I would recommend:</p>\n<p><strong>Best Overall</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lululemon City Sweat Jogger. Mac Weldons also come close second</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Best Overall on Budget</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Uniqlo Sweatpant which are $30.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Best Structured</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Olivers Bradburry Jogger. The Lululemon ABC jogger comes at close second and it's better if you want more heavy weight materal.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Best Structured on Budget</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Zara or the H&amp;M from my budget joggers haul. Zara ones are $40 and H&amp;M are $25.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Best Lounging Sweatpant</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>None from the high end haul. For lounging sweatpants, I would go with one of the bugdet ones below, they are better value imo.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Best Lounging Sweatpant on a Budget</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gap Vintage Soft Jogger for lightweight. For mid to heavier weight, then check out the Goodthreads Fleece Joggers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That\u2019s it, I hope to not have to do another jogger try on for a very very long time after this. Thank you guys for reading this far down and until next time!</p></div>",

This time I tried <strong>10 joggers under $40.</strong></p>\n<p>If you\u2019re like me, you\u2019re probably wondering why are joggers so expensive. In my mind, they are fancy sweatpants so when I see a pair of Lululemons going for $120, I have a hard time justifying the price.</p>\n<p>But I wanted to find out for myself. I bought 20 pairs of joggers from budget Hanes that are $12 to high end Lululemons that cost $120. I wanted to find the best pair of joggers, regardless of the cost. This post is all about the 10 budget joggers. In my next post I\u2019ll be covering the 10 high end joggers which are around $100.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve also made a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/7sXYbqcjisY\"><strong><em>video</em></strong></a> of this review, in case you wanted to see what they look like on me. For reference I\u2019m 5\u20199 and 190 pounds. All joggers in this Haul are size L.</p>\n<h1>#1 Hanes EcoSmart Non-Pocket Sweatpants - $12.50</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>50% cotton and 50% polyester</li>\n<li>These are cheap and for the price pretty comfortable, especially for wearing them around the house. It\u2019s not the highest quality, but I\u2019ve had mine or 6 months and they\u2019ve held up pretty well so far. But I don\u2019t recommend them for 2 reasons. First, there\u2019s no pockets which make them not usable at all. And second, the drawstring is a single loop so it\u2019s kind of difficult to cinch the waist. I actually had to watch a Youtube video to figure out how to tie these things. They are affordable but they are not practical at all so I don\u2019t recommend them. <strong>I would pick the Gap Vintage Soft joggers over these.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h1>#2 Southpole Jogger Fleece Pants - $15</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>100% polyester</li>\n<li>These are the Amazon best sellers for sweatpants. These are decent, they\u2019re comfortable and feel very soft. They are fleece lined so with spring and summer coming up they are going to be too warm. Personally, I\u2019ll be returning these but if you\u2019re looking for a pair of fleece sweatpants for the winter these are probably the best deal out there. I own another fleece sweatpants from Abercrombie and those are around $60. The A&amp;F sweatpants are better quality but these are definitely comparable to those. The quality is lower, but for $15 they get the job done.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>#3 Zara Slim Fit Jogger Pants - $40</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>97% cotton and 3% elastane</li>\n<li>Man, I really really wish these would fit better. As a guy with big legs these are too tight all around. I love the way they look and feel, but they are too small. They are too tight and too restricting in the legs area, especially when I sit down. The waist band is not very stretchy, so even just putting them on feels like a task. chore. It\u2019s a bummer because these are great looking joggers. If you guys are looking for something trendy and stylish though check out the Zara website for joggers, they have tons of models and different styles and they all look pretty good.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>#4 Gap Slim Canvas Joggers - $39</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>98% cotton and 2% elastane</li>\n<li>These are the second structured pair of joggers in this Haul and these are decent, but I don\u2019t really love the fit. They fit straight through the leg and only taper at the very bottom. I personally am looking for something slimmer that hugs the leg a little more.  The fabric is stretchy so they are comfortable even when sitting down. I wish they were a little softer. They have this cool to the touch feeling, which I personally don\u2019t care for.  I\u2019ll return these because <strong>for $40 the H&amp;M reviewed below are a better deal.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h1>#5 Champion Powerblend Retro Jogger - $23</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>50% cotton and 50% polyester</li>\n<li>These are the sweatpants that everyone is recommending online but I personally don\u2019t think they are worth it. The fit is a little slimmer in the legs, but otherwise fits okay. But the material is not very good. It feels synthetic, light and just not very high quality. The cuffs on the bottom are super loose already. These sweatpants feel like they will wear out with every wash and won\u2019t be very durable.So don\u2019t recommend these. For the same price, the <strong>Goodthreads reviewed below are a better deal all around.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h1>#6 [Best Lightweight] Gap Vintage Soft Joggers - $55 but on sale for $27</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>77% cotton and 14% polyester and 9% recycled materials</li>\n<li>I loved these. Probably the most lightweight and comfortable sweatpants in this haul. They have inner lining, so they are extremely soft. When I\u2019m wearing these I barely feel like I\u2019m wearing anything at all. For me these are the perfect Sunday lounger sweatpants. They are baggy, roomy, comfortable and great all around. I\u2019m not sure how they would hold up after few washes, but on initial impression these are very nice. The regular price is $55 but if you buy an off-color one, like the blue I got, they are around $27 which I think is a great deal. These are the best baggy, lounger sweatpants all around.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>#7 Old Navy Modern Jogger - $40</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>98% cotton and 2% elastane</li>\n<li>I didn\u2019t like these. They don\u2019t fit me and the material is too harsh, they feel canvas-y a little bit. They\u2019re too large in the waist but if I size them down they will be too tight in the legs.  Even though there\u2019s 2% elastane there\u2019s not a whole lot of stretch, so when I sit down these press against my knees and they don\u2019t feel very comfortable. I returned these because for the same price, the H&amp;M or the Zara are better quality joggers.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>#8 [Best Value] Uniqlo Mens Sweatpants - $30</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>90% cotton and 10% poly</li>\n<li>These are amazing! Seriously, along with the Gap these are the second best sweatpants in this Haul hands down! They are super comfortable and soft. They are mostly cotton so they feel natural and breathable. The cotton feels kind of ribbed so they are really soft on the touch. They\u2019re maybe a little longer in the bottom, but I don\u2019t mind it since they are cuffed. These joggers come the closest to the Lululemon City Sweat. In my video I show them side by side and you can see that they are pretty similar in how they look and they are pretty similar in the comfort level as well. These are only $30 compared to the Lulus which are $120. The Lulus feel more premium, they have more technical material in them and they\u2019re a little more structured, but <strong>for $30 I think these are incredible sweatpants and I recommend them 100%.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h1>#9 [Best Heavyweight] Goodthreads Fleece Jogger Pants - $27</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>90% cotton and 10% polyester</li>\n<li>These feel like high quality sweatpants and they are the best heavyweight sweatpants all around. They are soft and feel natural and there\u2019s plenty of breathing room. They have a little heavier fabric so you feel them on when you wear them. They feel similar to Uniqlo, very natural and not synthetic at all but they are heavier. These run a little big because the Large is too large on me, it\u2019s too wide in the waist and also super long.  I\u2019ll probably return these though cause I don\u2019t need another pair of sweatpants and these are in the middle of the pack, but I think for the money they fare well worth it. Definitely <strong>recommend these over the Champions</strong> if you want more heavyweight sweatpants.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>#10 [Best Structured] H&amp;M Regular Fit Twill Joggers - $25</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>98% cotton and 2% spandex</li>\n<li>Best value joggers all around. I love the way these feel, they are soft and there\u2019s a little bit of stretch to them. They feel similar to the Zara ones, but are $15 cheaper. This particular pair is too large on me, they are too big in the waist and too long. But I already ordered a pair of Medium and they just came yesterday and they fit perfectly.  At $25 these are incredible deal and the best structured joggers in the entire Haul. If you\u2019re looking for a pair of joggers you can wear outside, and even at the office, these are the ones!</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Summing up</h1>\n<p>Thank you guys for reading this far down. I\u2019m going to wait to make a keep/return decision after I try on the high end joggers. But if I had to pick the best joggers from this haul, here\u2019s my top picks:</p>\n<p><strong>Best Value Overall</strong> - Uniqlo Mens Sweatpants</p>\n<p><strong>Best Lightweight</strong> - Gap Vintage Soft</p>\n<p><strong>Best Heavyweight</strong> -  Goodthreads Fleece Jogger</p>\n<p><strong>Best Structured</strong>  -  H&amp;M Regular Fit Twill Joggers</p></div>",

If you guys haven't caught the ones prior, this is where I go out and spend a stupid amount of money on one type of clothing in order to find where the sweet spot lies in terms of price vs quality.  I really enjoy putting these together and reading/replying to all the comments so hoping the response is the same as the previous posts.. Hopefully you guys enjoy this one just as much as the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/ithz81/review_i_spent_700_on_sweatsjoggers_to_find_the/\">Joggers</a> and <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/k09xwx/i_spent_600_on_tshirts_to_find_the_best_one/\">T-Shirt</a>  ones I did a while back.</p>\n<p>The next item I'm thinking about doing are hoodies.  I have a Saint Laurent one for the luxury option, an Asket and John Elliott one for the $100-150 price point but need some more that you guys swear by. Feel free to drop your favs in the comments to help out with the next edition of this! Going to narrow it down to the top 5-6.</p>\n<h1>Video:</h1>\n<p>As always, 90% of the info is here but if you want to see a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Gc8ycy2UU\">video review</a> with more shots of the shirts, I've linked the 14 minute video here. None of that typical in your face type content but some quality stuff that takes a bit to produce but is totally worth it. The joggers and t-shirts ones are also in the library somewhere so feel free to check those out.</p>\n<p>Album: <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/cqahOmi\">https://imgur.com/a/cqahOmi</a></p>\n<h1>Introduction:</h1>\n<p>I've worn polos literally my entire life. It's what my parents dressed me in when I was a child. I love that they're simple yet timeless and a classy alternative to normal tees while being just as laid back. When it gets as hot as it does in Texas, polos have been a great way to put more effort into an outfit while still staying cool.</p>\n<p>For this head to head, I've included only pique polos since they're the most common. Pique is that woven, waffle textured material known for its breathability and flexibility. I've selected this range by browsing blogs, Reddit posts, other YouTube videos and fashion magazines and then narrowed it down to the most popular ones. If there are some you really like that I didn't include, leave them in the comments and I'll look into them for a potential part 2.</p>\n<p>My ideal polo is one that gets 4 things right: fit, fabric, collar, and overall construction.</p>\n<p>For fit I want it to drapes well, hugs the arms and is fitted in the chest but is leaves room around the stomach. I'm looking for the sleeves to end mid bicep and the length to hit mid crotch. A split hem is an added bonus since I have larger thighs. In terms of quality, I look for a solid, structured collar and attention to detail throughout.</p>\n<p>For reference, I\u2019m 5\u201910\u201d, 175-180 lbs. These are all a small or medium. I went off the measurements on the size charts.</p>\n<h1>Uniqlo</h1>\n<p>We'll start with the cheapest and work our way up. Uniqlo Dry Pique Short Sleeve Polo Shirt came in right around $20 and I honestly don't have many complaints at this price point.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fit</strong>:</li>\n<li>I went true to size with medium. It was one of the  most relaxed of the bunch when it comes to fit which results in longer than ideal sleeve lengths. The shoulder and length are perfect but I do have a bit of extra fabric around my underarms which results in the chest not being as fitted as I prefer.</li>\n<li><strong>Fabric</strong>:</li>\n<li>There's not much to talk about regarding the fabric. It's nothing special but gets the job done. The pique fabric weave is on the tighter end resulting in less texture and stretch but a smoother feel.</li>\n<li><strong>Construction</strong>:</li>\n<li>The single layer collar on this shirt is on the flimsy end and looks to be made of the same ribbed material as the cuffs. The placket is nice and deep and the plastic buttons are expected at this price point. I like the split hem and the ribbed cuffs. Uniqlo sells it in 9 colors at the moment but they rotate the options frequently.</li>\n<li><strong>Thoughts:</strong></li>\n<li>Although it's not my favorite, I've been wearing this quite a lot as it's different to every other polo I own. I've been really into oversized tees recently and I think that may play a part in me wearing this one more frequently. It's looser fit creates a nice contrast when paired with some slimmer bottoms and sneakers. According to the reviews under the polo on their website, Uniqlo seems to tweak these yearly so I'm not sure how long this info will be true. Overall, it's a great polo for $20 but might not look as tailored and polished as most guys would want a polo to look.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Kent Wang</h1>\n<p>I had no idea about this brand until I saw a post on a subreddit on this while doing research for the vid. I got my hands on this white one in a size medium that goes for $65.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fit:</strong></li>\n<li>Kent Wang claims these to be very slim fit, saying it's even slimmer than Zara and Ralph Lauren's custom fit. Reading this, I ordered a medium and a large so I could compare the two. Although the polo was on the slimmer end of the spectrum, it wasn't by too much in my opinion. The top fit like a normal custom fit but the stomach was slimmer than the rest. The large was a bit too baggy for my liking but the medium was just about right. The sleeves land right where I want them and the chest is perfect. The stomach area leaves <strong><em>just</em></strong> enough room for me but it's cutting it close. If it were any slimmer and I think it would be too tight for my liking. The length was longer than the rest causing some slight bunching around the waist.</li>\n<li><strong>Fabric:</strong></li>\n<li>It's not fair to call this fabric stiff by any means but let's say it's the most structured of the batch. That being said, it's still that normal pique fabric so it feels similar to what you would expect it to. The weave isn't too tight or too loose, and felt comparable to Ralph Lauren.</li>\n<li><strong>Construction:</strong></li>\n<li>The highlight of this polo has to be the collar. It is constructed with the same material as the rest of the polo. Made of a collar band and two layers fabric, I found this to be much stronger than the typical single layer. I've washed this many time and the collar has not lost its shape at all. The spread collar and the way its constructed makes it naturally want to stand up tall in an elegant way. The placket is a perfect depth and features three mother-of-pearl buttons. The buttons and super thick and hefty in a good way. I liked the three buttons as they gave me the flexibility to wear the polo as casual or as dressed up as I wanted.</li>\n<li><strong>Thoughts:</strong></li>\n<li>Kent Wang seems like a no-nonsense kind of brand. No fancy packaging or marketing, just a brand thats out to bring really good clothing at a competitive price. I really respect that. The polo comes in a ton of different colors. The inner branding seems prone to peeling after some washes but even if that doesn't hold up I still think this is a great polo.</li>\n<li>The price did go up to $75 from $65 but I'd still recommend it as it competes neck in neck with the higher cost options.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Lacoste:</h1>\n<p>Lacoste is considered the OG of the polo world. Although the history of the polo is debated, the first polos come from India in the 1850s. However, it wasn\u2019t until nearly a century later that they started becoming popular when President Eisenhower was seen wearing his Lacoste polo. They retail for $90 but certain colors can be found for around $50 on sale.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fit</strong></li>\n<li>Sizing is weird on this one so I would recommend trying on in store prior to purchasing. I had originally tried on the slim fit in a medium but it was way too tight so ended up going with a classic fit in a small to get that \u201ccustom fit\u201d look I prefer. The classic fit in a medium was too baggy for me. The front and back are the same length making this harder to tuck in than the options with staggered lengths. I love the longer sleeves that still manage to hug the arms.</li>\n<li><strong>Fabric</strong></li>\n<li>The fabric on this polo was thin, lightweight and breathable with the pique being on the finer side. The combination makes it perfect for warmer days. The finer weave makes the polo look like it has less texture compared to the rest and the texture feels near identical to Loro Piana's.</li>\n<li><strong>Construction</strong></li>\n<li>The collar was disappointing on an otherwise great polo. It\u2019s made from a ribbed cotton material that curl very easily. The deep placket helped give it a more upscale look in my opinion and the grey buttons were a nice touch.</li>\n<li><strong>Thoughts</strong></li>\n<li>Im going to be honest, I never really gave Lacoste a shot before this comparison but I really liked this polo. Everything from it\u2019s rich history to the plethora of colors available makes this a solid choice. If it wasn\u2019t for the collars, I could see myself having multiples of these in my wardrobe.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Ralph Lauren</h1>\n<p>As Lacoste was gaining steam for its Polo amongst college students going for an athleisure look at the time, it was Ralph Lauren who took the concept mainstream internationally. My parents used to get these for me on clearance when I was super young and paired it with jean shorts or chinos. Something about that new england dress code stuck with me and was my daily uniform growing up.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fit</strong></li>\n<li>Getting right into it, I\u2019ve worn a custom fit medium for years now. It\u2019s very easy to find the perfect fit as Ralph Lauren offers three fits: the classic, the custom fit and a slim fit and 6 sizes XS to XXL. Speaking for the custom fit, it hugs the arms and chest and tapers towards the waist. The length is an inch or two short for my preference but it\u2019s worth the tradeoff since everything else fits well. I\u2019ve had a few shirts shrink more than others so size accordingly if it isn\u2019t the classic mesh fabric.</li>\n<li><strong>Fabric</strong></li>\n<li>The fabric is alright. It\u2019s normal polo pique fabric that\u2019s not soft or stiff, not lightweight or heavy. Just average across the board. That being said, it gets the job done.</li>\n<li><strong>Construction</strong></li>\n<li>Another polos whose collars really disappointed. It\u2019s made of a very similar construction to Lacoste's. l really like the slightly staggered front and back with the rear being roughly an inch longer. Fit and finish are on par and the shorter placket lets you get away with not buttoning up without looking too obnoxious.</li>\n<li><strong>Thoughts</strong></li>\n<li>90% of the polos in my closet were from Ralph Lauren prior to me putting this episode together. I love them for the nostalgia but in terms of quality and price, there are definitely better options out there. Ralph Lauren has a ton of colors available so that's another plus. They retail for $95 but it\u2019s fairly easy to find them much cheaper at department stores or off season.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Sunspel</h1>\n<p>The Sunspel Riviera polo was the one I was most excited to try on this list. It was made in 2006 for Daniel Craig to wear in Casino Royale but Sunspel has been around since the 1800s. Sunspel oozes heritage and innovation throughout the years.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fit</strong></li>\n<li>I ordered mine in a size medium in the Forest color way. It fit true to size and I\u2019ve had no shrinkage over many washes. The polo is trim but not overly slim. The sleeves hit right at your mid-bicep and did not restrict my movement.</li>\n<li><strong>Fabric</strong></li>\n<li>The fabric is exceptional. This polo had the widest and loosest weave out of all the others that I tested. The best way I could describe it was wearing a jersey made from some of the softest cotton.</li>\n<li><strong>Construction</strong></li>\n<li>The collar is made from two layers of the same material as the shirt itself. It looks very polished and I was surprised how structured it remained with the rest of the shirt being so open and airy. They opted to go for a monochromatic look with matching plastic buttons. It\u2019s a cool look and are constructed really well but I feel like they cheap\u2019d out with plastic at this price. The pocket was also something I wasn\u2019t the biggest fan of since it makes the shirt look more casual but that just comes down to personal preference.</li>\n<li><strong>Thoughts</strong></li>\n<li>There\u2019s just something about wearing James Bonds polo that give you a little extra pep in your step. I love the fabric especially on days where you have to look put together and the temperatures are in the upper 90s. The fit, fabric, and construction were all solid and all lived up to my expectations. I bought mine for $150 but I\u2019ve been seeing them on sale for $64 on their site recently depending on color.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Loro Piana</h2>\n<p>I\u2019ve been drawn to this Italian brand for a while now but have never owned a piece from them. I had heard that their fabrics were exceptional and were the ultimate combination of quality and luxury. I figured I would head to the nearest boutique to get the full experience. I walked in to be half greeted by the sales associates only to be taken seriously after I told them I was looking to purchase a polo. I told them I wanted their classic pique polo to which they were slightly confused as they pulled some vicuna and cashmere polos instead. Although they were incredibly supple, the price tag for each were in the thousands. I ended up going with the cotton one for a whopping $545 before taxes in a size medium in the optic white color.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fit</strong></li>\n<li>Alright, so what exactly does nearly $600 for a cotton polo get you and is it really 30x as good as the Uniqlo we tested. Right off the bat the answer is no but there\u2019s more to it. Lets start with the fit: I went for a medium but didn\u2019t quite love any size I tried on. The cut was boxy and structured but light and flowy all at the same time. The sleeves hit a bit under the middle of your bicep and don\u2019t hug them at all. The shoulders on the medium were about an inch too wide for me but the small was too narrow. The rest of the shirt fit like a traditional classic fit.</li>\n<li><strong>Fabric</strong></li>\n<li>Moving into the fabric. My first impression was how thin it was, upon trying it on it wasn\u2019t see through but you could definitely see my skin tone blend with the white fabric in the areas where the fabric wasn\u2019t double lined. The weave was on the finer side and was most comparable to Lacoste in terms of knit and texture. The fabric felt amazing on skin, silky smooth with a softness I haven\u2019t encountered on a cotton pique polo.</li>\n<li><strong>Construction</strong></li>\n<li>The build quality and fit and finish were exceptional but that\u2019s to be expected on a $600 polo. The placket was the deepest of the batch and the three pearl buttons were super nice. The Loro Piana red stitch was a nice touch on the top button. They opt for a curved hem to make it easier to tuck in however with the fabric being so thin, mine had a tenancy to curl and needed extra ironing after washing to get it to lay flat. The collars were stiff and felt like something off a button down shirt. The collar, deep placket, along with the curved hem really made this feel like a pique button down with three buttons instead of a true polo. That isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing but just something to note.</li>\n<li><strong>Thoughts</strong></li>\n<li>Alright, so if it weren\u2019t for this video, I would never consider going out to spend this sorts of money on a polo. There\u2019s a level of diminishing return for all articles of clothing, where spending twice as much on something doesn\u2019t get you twice the quality. I would say this occurs fairly early for polo shirts. At the end of the day, pique feels near identical throughout the spectrum. So long as you like the fit and construction, there\u2019s no reason to spend close to this much. This is one of those cases where you\u2019re paying for the prestige of the brand rather than the quality they\u2019re putting out.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Summary:</h1>\n<p>This video taught me that it\u2019s really hard to mess up a polo. As long as the polo has the features you prefer you really can\u2019t go wrong. Based on the collar, fabric, fit, and construction and if money were no object I would take Sunspel followed very closely by Kent Wang, Loro Piana, Lacoste, Ralph Lauren then Uniqlo in that order. Being more budget focused, I think I would either save and wait for Sunspel to go on sale or go with Kent Wang before dishing out money on Uniqlo. I think the Sunspel and Kent Wang would last longer and look much better over time compared to the Uniqlo one so that may be worth the extra cost. These had the slimmest margins of any comparison that i\u2019ve done so far so you really can\u2019t go wrong with any.</p>\n<h1>TLDR/Overall Rank if You Just Want the Best:</h1>\n<ol>\n<li>Sunspel</li>\n<li>Kent Wang</li>\n<li>Loro Piana</li>\n<li>Lacoste</li>\n<li>Ralph Lauren</li>\n<li>Uniqlo</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>Budget Friendly Ranking:</h1>\n<ol>\n<li>Sunspel on sale at $64</li>\n<li>Kent Wang ($75) -- I think both these will last longer than the Uniqlo hence the reason I'm ranking them higher, it'll be a lower cost per wear in the long term</li>\n<li>Uniqlo</li>\n<li>Lacoste</li>\n<li>Ralph Lauren</li>\n<li>Loro Piana</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Obviously, this is just my personal opinion based off what I look for. Your order could be the complete opposite and that's okay. Any of these are a solid pick. I'm not expert and just sharing thoughts based on what I like and what I look for. Hope this was somewhat helpful!</p></div>",

This question gets asked so much around here, it\u2019s basically a meme.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re like me though and you have big legs, you probably hate shopping for jeans online. It\u2019s such a pain in the ass that I avoid it as much as possible. Lately though I\u2019ve been needing a  new pair of jeans since my old ones are worn out and don\u2019t fit me anymore. So I decided to try on a bunch of the recommended options here to find the best jeans for me.</p>\n<p>10 jeans and $700 dollars later, I was able to find a few pairs that I actually really  loved. The experience was still annoying though but I was super happy with the few jeans I kept and hopefully I won't have to do this again for a while. Here\u2019s my honest review of each jean I tried and what I liked and didn\u2019t like about it.</p>\n<p>For you visual guys out there, I also made a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt8mm2hzw-M\">Youtube Video</a> that has all the info from below, plus links plus you can see how they fit on me.</p>\n<p>For reference, I\u2019m 5\u20199\u201d and 190lbs. I wear a 34x32 jean size and my thighs are 27in wide.</p>\n<h1>#1 Wrangler\u2019s Regular Taper Jean</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>$26.99, made of 98% cotton and 2% spandex.</li>\n<li>I think these are the best jeans all around. Only $30 but fit really well and are comfortable. There\u2019s plenty of room in the seat area and they\u2019re tapered at the bottom so it looks clean. I own 3 other pairs of these and I use them for working around the house and casually around town. If I could buy just one pair of jeans these would be it.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>#2 Amazon Essentials Athletic Stretch Jean</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>$31.90, made of 98% cotton and 2% elastane</li>\n<li>These are way too big and baggy. They are big in the waist and also super long in the bottom. Definitely size down if you\u2019re thinking about buying these. Also I didn\u2019t love the material, it\u2019s not very soft and they have a course and rough feeling to them.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>#3 Everlane Athletic Stretch Jean</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>$88, made of 94% cotton, 2% elastane and 4% other materials</li>\n<li>By far my favorite jeans in this Haul. These are extremely comfortable and the material feels heavy, like it\u2019s a super high quality. They are is super soft and stretchy. They feel comfortable when sitting down so I can wear this when I work at my desk. The taper on the bottom is perfect too. They are a little large in the waist, so I probably could have sized down to 33x32 with these but they didn\u2019t have this size</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>#4 JCrew 1040 Athletic jean</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>$98, made of 100% cotton even though the website says they should have some stretch material to them.</li>\n<li>I had high hopes for these, but I was super disappointed. There\u2019s barely any stretch to them and they don\u2019t feel comfortable at all. They restrict my movement when walking or even just standing up straight. When I bend down in these, it feels like they\u2019re going to rip any moment. Also at $100 they\u2019re a little overpriced. Do not recommend these for guys with big legs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>#5 Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Athletic Skinny Jeans</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>$78, made of 94% cotton, 4% polyester and 2% elastane.</li>\n<li>These jeans are amazing. They fit really well, and they are soft and stretchy and feel really comfortable. Also they are very fashion forward, more so than any other brand I tried. So these would be perfect for date nights. Definitely in top 3 of this Haul.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>#6 Levis 541\u2122 Athletic Taper Fit</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>$79.50, made of 68% cotton, 31% lyocell and 1% elastane.</li>\n<li>Overpriced. The fit is good but the material feels kind of cheap, they are light weight and there\u2019s too much stretch, at least for my taste. I know these are classics and everyone recommends them, but for the same price, I recommend the Everlane or the Abercrombie instead.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>#7 American Eagle Athletic Fit Jean</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>$39.95, made of 99% cotton and 1% elastane</li>\n<li>Blown away how good these jeans were, and only $40. They're extremely soft and super comfortable. This pair is 33x32 and they fit perfect. They sit just right in the waist area and there\u2019s plenty of room in the seat and leg. I only wish they had more colors on their website. When I checked they only had 3 and I liked the light wash the best.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>#8 Gap Flex Athletic Taper Jeans</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>$70, made of 93% cotton, 5% elastane and 2% spandex</li>\n<li>I loved, loved the color but these jeans are way too short. The inseam feels more like a 30\u2019 instead of 32\u2019. They fit okay in the waist, but are too short on the bottom. When I cuff them up they look like capri pants. Gap is cool though, they have tons of discounts all the time and I\u2019ve never paid full price for anything from them.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>#9 Lucky Brand 411 Athletic Taper</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>$69.30, made of 94% cotton 4% polyester 2% elastane</li>\n<li>Really soft and comfortable. They fit true to size but the taper on the legs is a little too aggressive. They are also a little too stretchy for my taste. I was on the fence with these and almost kept them. I liked them, but I didn\u2019t really love them. I don\u2019t know why but I ended up returning them. Maybe they were just too basic and for $70 I didn\u2019t think they were worth it.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>#10 Lee Men's Legendary Athletic Tapered Leg Jean</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>$32.79, made of 99% cotton and 1% spandex.</li>\n<li>Along with Wranger\u2019s and Amazon Essentials these were the other budget jeans I tried. They were only $32 but they are way too long in the bottom and not tapered at all. They have more of a bootcut leg opening. The fabric feels really soft though, better than the Wranglers or the Amazon Essentials. They stretch and are comfortable when sitting down. For $32 I\u2019d definitely get these if they were to fit me a little better.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Summing up</h1>\n<p>And that was it. I tried 10 pairs and ended up keeping 4. I\u2019m super happy with the jeans I found and I didn\u2019t just settle for the first available brand out there.</p>\n<p>If there\u2019s one thing I learned from this haul is this though: <strong>make sure the jeans you buy have some type of stretch material in them</strong>. 100% cotton will be too restrictive and won't feel comfortable.</p>\n<p>As far as best jeans, here\u2019s my favorite:</p>\n<p><strong>Best overall</strong> --- Wranglers</p>\n<p><strong>Most comfortable</strong> --- Everlane</p>\n<p><strong>Most Fashionable</strong> --- Abercrombie</p>\n<p><strong>Biggest Surprise</strong> --- American Eagle</p></div>",
