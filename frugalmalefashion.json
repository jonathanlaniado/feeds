Shaka Wear Max Heavyweight (SHMHSS) - $10 to $15</h1>\n<p><strong>Fabric</strong></p>\n<p>This shirt is thick. Says 7.5 oz and it feels every bit of that. It\u2019s stiff outta the bag and kinda feels like you\u2019re putting on cardboard but in a good way? Def not preshrunk so plan on losing some length after the first wash. Fabric\u2019s solid tho. Doesn\u2019t feel soft but feels like it\u2019ll last a while.</p>\n<p><strong>Fabric: 8/10</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Construction</strong></p>\n<p>The stitching\u2019s alright. Not perfect but nothing majorly wrong. Collar is beefy but no taping inside so expect some neck stretch over time. If you\u2019re expecting premium finishing touches, this ain\u2019t it. But it\u2019s good enough.</p>\n<p><strong>Workmanship: 6/10</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Value</strong></p>\n<p>For like 12 bucks this is kinda unbeatable. If you want a super boxy fit or something to layer, this one delivers.</p>\n<p><strong>Value: 9/10</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Total: 23/30</strong></p>\n<h1>2. Vesti IT645T - $20</h1>\n<p><strong>Fabric</strong></p>\n<p>Heaviest of the bunch, but also my favorite. I had never heard of this brand but saw them promoted heavily on <a href=\"http://alldayshirts.com\">alldayshirts.com</a> when ordering some of these other shirts. It is an italian brand and the shirts are made in italy. 8.1 oz 100% cotton. Feels different formt he rest, more premium. The heaviness comes through but its still very soft and comfortable.</p>\n<p><strong>Fabric: 9/10</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Construction</strong></p>\n<p>The construction seems moreintentional than some of the other shirts I tried. Tearaway tag which is nice. Certainly stands out among all these. As the only one made in italy I think that plays a huge role.</p>\n<p><strong>Workmanship: 10/10</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Value</strong></p>\n<p>More expensive than some on the list but if you\u2019re looking for an everyday wear $20 is reasonable for this weight and quality. If this was made in china or something like the rest probably are i\u2019m sure teh cost would be lower but so would the quality.</p>\n<p><strong>Value: 9/10</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Total: 28/30</strong></p>\n<h1>3. Comfort Colors C1717 - $9 to $15</h1>\n<p><strong>Fabric</strong></p>\n<p>This one\u2019s 6.1 oz but it feels nice and dense. Real soft too. Garment dyed so the color\u2019s got that faded look right out the gate. Already feels like it\u2019s been worn for years. Doesn\u2019t shrink much either which is a win.</p>\n<p><strong>Fabric: 7/10</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Construction</strong></p>\n<p>Pretty good all around. Stitching is straight, shoulder seams hold up, nothing fancy but gets the job done. Feels like a step up from basic promo tees.</p>\n<p><strong>Workmanship: 7/10</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Value</strong></p>\n<p>These are everywhere for a reason. You\u2019ll prob end up with like 3 without realizing it. Just an easy shirt to wear.</p>\n<p><strong>Value: 8/10</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Total: 22/30</strong></p>\n<h1>4. Gildan Ultra Cotton (G200) - $4 to $8</h1>\n<p><strong>Fabric</strong></p>\n<p>6 oz and feels cheap. Kinda rough, not ringspun, stiff in a bad way. After a couple washes it softens a little but still doesn\u2019t feel great. Gets the job done but don\u2019t expect much.</p>\n<p><strong>Fabric: 5/10</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Construction</strong></p>\n<p>Inconsistent. Some are stitched fine, others have crooked hems or weird necklines. Collar gets wavy after like 3 wears. Has shoulder tape but that\u2019s about it.</p>\n<p><strong>Workmanship: 5/10</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Value</strong></p>\n<p>Super cheap and feels like it. Great for yardwork or screen printing but not something you\u2019ll reach for unless you have to.</p>\n<p><strong>Value: 6/10</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Total: 16/30</strong></p>\n<h1>5. Bella+Canvas 4610C Heavyweight - $14 to $20</h1>\n<p><strong>Fabric</strong></p>\n<p>This is 7.5 oz and feels soft, smooth, and kind of luxe. Def more fashion tee than work tee. Shrinks a little but not much. Real comfy for everyday wear.</p>\n<p><strong>Fabric: 6/10</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Construction</strong></p>\n<p>Very clean. Side seams, even stitching, solid neckband. Has that retail vibe. Feels like it was made with attention to detail.</p>\n<p><strong>Workmanship: 8/10</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Value</strong></p>\n<p>Price is a little high for what you get weight-wise, but the feel and fit are dialed in. If you care about style over ruggedness, this one makes sense.</p>\n<p><strong>Value: 7/10</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Total: 21/30</strong></p>\n<h1>6. Pro Club Heavyweight (101) - $10 to $16</h1>\n<p><strong>Fabric</strong></p>\n<p>This thing is a tank. 7 oz and feels like more somehow. Like you\u2019re wearing a moving box at first but it breaks in nice. Takes a few washes to soften up. Gets better with time.</p>\n<p><strong>Fabric: 8/10</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Construction</strong></p>\n<p>Honestly built like a brick. Collar is super thick, seams are reinforced, neckline stays tight. You can beat it up and it keeps going.</p>\n<p><strong>Workmanship: 7/10</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Value</strong></p>\n<p>One of the best heavy tees out there and still cheap. Can\u2019t beat this for a solid everyday or layering piece.</p>\n<p><strong>Value: 8/10</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Total: 23/30</strong></p>\n<h1>7. AS Colour Classic Tee (5080) - $24 to $28</h1>\n<p><strong>Fabric</strong></p>\n<p>6.5 oz cotton. It\u2019s soft but still got some structure. I prefer heavier. Doesn\u2019t shrink, doesn\u2019t fade fast, and holds up really well. Super comfy and still looks crisp.</p>\n<p><strong>Fabric: 7/10</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Construction</strong></p>\n<p>Basic, not amazing not terrible. Acceptable, as expected.</p>\n<p><strong>Workmanship: 8/10</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Value</strong></p>\n<p>On the pricier side for blanks, but worth it if you want something a little elevated. You\u2019ll know where that money went.</p>\n<p><strong>Value: 6/10</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Total: 21/30</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Final Rankings / TLDR</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Vesti IT645T</strong> \u2014 <strong>28/30</strong></li>\n<li>Pro Club 101 \u2013 23/30</li>\n<li>AS Colour 5080 \u2013 21/30</li>\n<li>Shaka Wear SHMHSS \u2013 23/30</li>\n<li>Comfort Colors C1717 \u2013 22/30</li>\n<li>Bella+Canvas 4610C \u2013 21/30</li>\n<li>Gildan G200 \u2013 16/30</li>\n</ul>",

Uniqlo U Crew Neck Tee ($20)</h1>\n<p><strong>Fabric</strong></p>\n<p>This is made from 100% cotton, single jersey knit.\u00a0 Nothing too fancy.</p>\n<p>This is not preshrunk fabric, if you hold it against a light, you can see how loosely weaved it is.\u00a0 Uniqlo does this to save on cost because preshrunk fabric is more expensive.\u00a0 Expect this shirt to shrink around 5%-10%.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This fabric does have some weight to it, weighing in at 232 g.\u00a0 I appreciate Uniqlo for not skimping out on the fabric thickness.\u00a0 This thicker cotton fabric is more durable and you\u2019ll get a higher cost per wear.</p>\n<p>Overall, the fabric is not bad but nothing to go crazy about.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Fabric: 6/10</p>\n<p><strong>Construction</strong></p>\n<p>For the workmanship, this is where Uniqlo shines from other fast fashion brands. Every seam is straight and near perfect.\u00a0 The hem, sleeves and neckline uses a chain stitch and finished off with a top stitch for a clean and more durable finish.</p>\n<p>Uniqlo even went as far as to add a little loop for the tag to hang on. \u00a0Most brands will stab the tag through the fabric which permanently damages the shirt but not Uniqlo.</p>\n<p>There's extra fabric in between the neckline to make it thicker.\u00a0 You can see the outline of it slightly. \u00a0Not saying that this won't become wavy over time, because it will. But it will hold its shape for a lot longer and you\u2019ll get more wears out of this.</p>\n<p>I do wish that they add a neck lining for more comfort and durability.</p>\n<p>Workmanship: 8/10</p>\n<p><strong>Value</strong></p>\n<p>For $20 this shirt is well constructed, and the fabric is decent. I do think you get a lot of value for this shirt so I have to rate it an 8/10.</p>\n<p>Total Score: 22/30</p>\n<h1>2. True Classic Crew Neck ($30)</h1>\n<p><strong>Fabric</strong></p>\n<p>This is a single jersey knit, made from 60% cotton and 40% polyester. It's very lightweight with a fabric weight of 160 GSM. \u00a0I\u2019ve owned this t shirt for over a year now and I\u2019ve worn and washed it around 10 times.\u00a0 One thing that I like about the fabric is that it\u2019s still soft after 10 washes and because of how stretchy the fabric is, the neckline doesn't become wavy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This fabric is loose knit so it will shrink like crazy after the first wash.\u00a0 I\u2019m talking about at least two inches in length and width so you need to size up.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Another thing is that it starts to pill like crazy after the first wash. People buy this tee for the fit rather than the quality and True Classic knows this so material is definitely skimped on.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Fabric: 4/10</p>\n<p><strong>Construction</strong></p>\n<p>Because this shirt is designed to hide your belly, it has an A-line cut at the torso to hug your chest but open wide down towards the waist. The sleeve opening is tapered to hug your arms to make you look more buff.\u00a0 The neckline has a lining that goes to your shoulder which is plus for comfort and durability.\u00a0 The stitching on this shirt is the worst I've ever seen.\u00a0 This chain stitch fell off track on this tee and they didn't even bother to fix it.\u00a0 What a decent company would do would be to toss this shirt away because it will not pass QC. but true classic is like whatever, lets sell it for $30.</p>\n<p>The biggest flaw is the fit. I have 3 tees from true classic and every single tee fits differently and also made from a different factory.\u00a0 For example, the tee from Vietnam fits longer than this one made in China.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Workmanship: 4/10</p>\n<p><strong>Value</strong></p>\n<p>For $30, that\u2019s expensive for what you\u2019re getting. I have to rate it a 4/10.</p>\n<p>Total score: 12/30</p>\n<h1>3. Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Premium Heavyweight 2.0 ($35)</h1>\n<p><strong>Fabric</strong></p>\n<p>It\u2019s a single jersey knit, made from 100% cotton.\u00a0 The cotton has been brushed for an extra soft and fluffy texture.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>So, what fast fashion brands usually do to get a quick sale, is that they run a brush through the fabric to raise the cotton fibers so it feels fluffy and soft in stores and that will get them a sale right away.  But after just 1 wash, that fabric is never gonna feel the same.</p>\n<p>If you hold the shirt in front of a light, you can see right through it meaning that this is loose weaved.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Brands will save money by not getting preshrunk fabric.\u00a0 It\u2019s more expensive because you will end up using more fabric. \u00a0Because of how loose weave this shirt is, it will shrink about 5-10% easily. \u00a0Also, loose weave combined with that brushed cotton will pill.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The neckline feels so slinky that after a couple of washes, you\u2019re gonna end up with a lot of waves.</p>\n<p>Fabric: 5/10</p>\n<p><strong>Construction</strong></p>\n<p>Another thing that fast fashion brands do to deceive you is the neckline.\u00a0 You think you get a full lining at the neckline but it only covers however much you see when it's hanging in stores.\u00a0 There\u2019s also a hole in my neckline.\u00a0 This is most likely caused by multiple price tag stabbing through the fabric.</p>\n<p>The hem and sleeve is just sewn with a chain stitch with no top stitch to finish it off.\u00a0 Overtime, these threads are gonna start to pull.</p>\n<p>Flipping the shirt inside out, there\u2019s busted seams everywhere.</p>\n<p>Workmanship: 3/10</p>\n<p><strong>Value</strong></p>\n<p>The quality control for Abercrombie is just so low especially for their premium line.\u00a0 $35 is not a lot but for this, it\u2019s not worth it.\u00a0 I would rate the value a 4/10.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Total score: 12/30</p>\n<h1>4. Taylor Stitch Cotton Hemp Tee ($40)</h1>\n<p><strong>Fabric</strong></p>\n<p>Hemp fibers are stronger and more durable than cotton. This fabric becomes softer after each wash.\u00a0 It\u2019s similar to linen where it is breathable, moisture wicking and resistant to bacteria and odors.</p>\n<p>Taylor Stitch does a great job at blending cotton and hemp together to make this a natural fiber tee.\u00a0 The fabric is extremely soft and comfortable.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The thickness of this fabric measures to .41 mm and a size small weighs in at only 100 grams.\u00a0 I\u2019m honestly surprised that you can make a tee this thin and lightweight.\u00a0 This is the perfect tee to wear during the summer but because of how thin this fabric is, you can easily see my nipples so I wished they used a thicker cut.</p>\n<p>Fabric: 8/10</p>\n<p><strong>Construction</strong></p>\n<p>The neckline and shoulder is finished with fabric tape for extra comfort, durability and a cleaner look which I do appreciate.</p>\n<p>The neckline has good stretch and its ribbed to help retain its shape. \u00a0 It uses a chain stitch on the shoulder for more stretch. It uses a reinforced double needle top stitch on the neckline. The sleeves and waist are sewn with a blanket stitch.</p>\n<p>Flipping this tee inside out, I noticed there are loose threads in a couple of areas but other than that, the construction is not bad at all.</p>\n<p>Workmanship: 8/10</p>\n<p><strong>Value</strong></p>\n<p>For the value, this shirt is made 100% of natural fibers.\u00a0 I know hemp is not a cheap fabric but I would've preferred a thicker cut.\u00a0 I\u2019ll rate the value a 7/10.</p>\n<p>Total score: 23/30</p>\n<h1>5. Steel City Perfect Tee ($45)</h1>\n<p><strong>Fabric</strong></p>\n<p>This is a single jersey knit, made from 100% pre shrunk cotton. The thickness measures to .8 mm and the tee weighs in at 181 grams so I would categorize this as a midweight tee.</p>\n<p>The texture has a roughness to it.\u00a0 I would describe it as feeling crisp rather than a cozy blanket.</p>\n<p>Steel City is one of the rare brands that uses pre shrunk fabric. Pre shrunk fabric is more expensive than non pre shrunk because they have to spend more money on extra fabric but in turn, it makes it easier to take care of and you don't have to worry about it losing its shape anytime soon.</p>\n<p>These tees are pigment dyed so the colors don't penetrate the cotton fibers evenly so you\u2019ll see more of that vintage fading look especially at the seams.</p>\n<p>Fabric: 8/10</p>\n<p><strong>Construction</strong></p>\n<p>For the construction, There\u2019s a double needle top stitch on the collar, sleeve and hem.\u00a0 The ribbed neckline has a good stretch to it.</p>\n<p>I wish Steel City used extra fabric to line the neckline and shoulder seams for a more clean finish. \u00a0I don't like when the shoulder seams flop back and forth like this.\u00a0 Maybe add a top stitch to sew it down.</p>\n<p>Flipping this tee inside out, there\u2019s a good amount of extra fabric that's rolled up and not sewn down at the sleeves.\u00a0 Doesn't affect the durability of this shirt at all, but it would look cleaner if this wasn\u2019t there. Other than that, everything else looks perfect. Straight and even stitches all around.</p>\n<p>Workmanship: 8/10</p>\n<p><strong>Value</strong></p>\n<p>$45 isn\u2019t a crazy price for this type of tee so for the value, I\u2019ll rate it an 8.</p>\n<p>Total Score: 24/30</p>\n<h1>6. American Giant Everest ($65)</h1>\n<p><strong>Fabric</strong></p>\n<p>This is made from 100% ring spun cotton.\u00a0 Ring spun cotton is the premium version of regular cotton.\u00a0 It's made by twisting short and long cotton strands together around a ring in a spinning machine.\u00a0 This not only makes the fabric stronger but also softer than regular cotton. This tee has a fabric weight of 515 GSM.\u00a0 That is insane.\u00a0 But for some reasons this tee weighs less than the Merz B. Schwanen Tee that uses 380 GSM so something is not adding up here.\u00a0 The thickness measures to 1.33 mm.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The drape on this t-shirt is perfect. It has a straight and beautiful silhouette, and because of the heavyweight fabric, it\u2019ll hold its shape well.</p>\n<p>Fabric: 9/10</p>\n<p><strong>Construction</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>For the workmanship, this tee is made in the USA.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It uses a binder collar construction where the body of the fabric is sandwiched between the ribbed fabric of the collar so that it creates a raised 3-D look.\u00a0 It also helps hold its shape longer so you don\u2019t get that wavy neckline.</p>\n<p>One of my favorite features of this shirt is the double needle topstitch at the shoulder and sleeves.\u00a0 A lot of brands would leave the seam flopping left and right but American Giants sews it down. This adds to the comfort and helps hold its shape better so your seams don't look wavy.</p>\n<p>Flipping this tee inside out, Every seam and stitching on this tee is done beautifully. I did notice an overly long thread at the sleeve that they could\u2019ve trimmed but other than that everything is even and straight.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Workmanship: 9/10</p>\n<p><strong>Value</strong></p>\n<p>For $65, that is not cheap but I think this tee will last you for years to come. So I will rate the value an 8/10.</p>\n<p>Total score: 26/30</p>\n<h1>7. Flint &amp; Tinder Heavyweight Pocket Tee ($68)</h1>\n<p><strong>Fabric</strong></p>\n<p>This is a single jersey knit, made from 100% cotton.\u00a0 This tee is heavyweight, weighing in at 308 grams and its thickness measures to 1.19 mm.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This fabric is advertised as having a thick weave so the texture has a slight rigidity to it but it still feels cozy like a blanket.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s garment dyed and pre washed so that creates a more worn and vintage look.</p>\n<p>It has a nice thick ribbed collar that I don't see losing its shape anytime soon.</p>\n<p>The drape on this t-shirt is awesome.\u00a0 It has an even and straight aesthetic, and because of the heavyweight fabric, the shape will last.</p>\n<p>Fabric: 9/10</p>\n<p><strong>Construction</strong></p>\n<p>For the workmanship, this tee is made in the USA.\u00a0 I appreciate the extra fabric for the neck lining for comfort and durability.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Flipping the tee inside out, I would appreciate it if they finish the shoulder and sleeve seams with a top stitch just to hold it in place so it doesn\u2019t flop left and right. There\u2019s a few overly long threads that they could\u2019ve trimmed for a cleaner finish but other than that, this tee is constructed almost perfectly. All the seams are straight and even. The collar, sleeve and hem is finished with a top stitch.</p>\n<p>Workmanship: 8/10</p>\n<p><strong>Value</strong></p>\n<p>At $68, that is not cheap but it is constructed well and uses thick fabric so I have to rate the value an 8/10.</p>\n<p>Total score: 25/30</p>\n<h1>8. Sunspel Riviera ($95)</h1>\n<p><strong>Fabric</strong></p>\n<p>The fabric is insanely soft because it is made from 100% Pima cotton.\u00a0 Sunspel uses a 2 fold fabric which is made from twisting two single strands of cotton together\u00a0 This creates a softer and more durable fabric which is why Supima tees from fast fashion brands like Uniqlo will feel different from luxury brands like Sunspel.</p>\n<p>The tee is extremely light weight. Weighing in at only 100 g, this the lightest tee featured in this review.\u00a0 The fabric is very thin, measuring to .78 mm.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you hold it up against a light, you can see right through it and wearing this tee, you can easily see my nipples. \u00a0This would make a great undershirt because of how soft the fabric is but because of how thin it is, I can't wear this as a stand alone piece.</p>\n<p>Fabric: 7/10</p>\n<p><strong>Construction</strong></p>\n<p>Everything is made in house in England.\u00a0 Sunspel has been making their tees here for 150 years.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Flipping this tee inside out, I noticed one huge flaw that is similar to the $30 true classic tee and that is the crooked chain stitch at the body.\u00a0 This tee shouldn\u2019t have passed QC especially for a luxury brand like Sunspel.\u00a0 If I\u2019m paying $95 for a paper thin tee, the construction has to be at least near perfect.</p>\n<p>Another complaint I have is I wish Sunspel used extra fabric to line the neckline and shoulder seams for a more clean finish.\u00a0 I don't like when the shoulder seams flop back and forth like this, it causes creases and it's not comfortable.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Other than that the hem, sleeves and neckline uses a chain stitch and finishes off with a top stitch for a clean finish.</p>\n<p>Workmanship: 6/10</p>\n<p><strong>Value</strong></p>\n<p>Because of the thin fabric and flaw in the stitching, I don\u2019t think this tee is worth anywhere near $95.\u00a0 So for the value, I\u2019ll rate it a 3/10.</p>\n<p>Total score: 16/30</p>\n<h1>9. Wonder Looper Double Heavyweight Tee\u00a0($113)</h1>\n<p><strong>Fabric</strong></p>\n<p>This tee is made in Japan using 100% cotton with a staggering 409 gsm weight.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The size medium weighs in at 380 grams and the thickness measures to 1.39 mm.</p>\n<p>This tee is made from circular knit machines as opposed to century old loopwheel machines.\u00a0 This means the fabric is denser and has a more uniform texture compared to the slubbiness of loopwheel tees.</p>\n<p>The texture isn\u2019t silky soft. It has a bit of of roughness to it.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m a huge fan of the silhouette of this tee. Because of the heavyweight fabric, it has a straight and even drape on the body. The fabric also doesn\u2019t cling.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Fabric: 10/10</p>\n<p><strong>Construction</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This tee is made from circular knit machines which is similar to loop wheel machines but more modern, faster and efficient.\u00a0</p>\n<p>On the sides, it has a flat seam construction made by a 4 needle flat seamer. This basically takes the fabric and presses it together to make it flat as possible which adds to the comfort.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You don\u2019t want a conventional overlock stitch or else that heavyweight fabric would look bulky.</p>\n<p>It uses a binder collar construction where the body of the fabric is sandwiched between the ribbed fabric of the collar so that it creates a raised 3-D look.\u00a0 It also helps hold its shape longer so you don\u2019t get that wavy neckline.</p>\n<p>Flipping this tee inside out, Every seam and stitching on this tee is done beautifully. I did notice an overly long thread at the sleeve that they could\u2019ve trimmed but other than that everything is even and straight.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Workmanship: 9/10</p>\n<p><strong>Value</strong></p>\n<p>$114 USD makes this the second most expensive tee featured in this review so I have to rate the value a 7.</p>\n<p>Total score: 26/30</p>\n<h1>10. Merz b. Schwanen 2S14 ($150)</h1>\n<p><strong>Fabric/Workmanship</strong></p>\n<p>This is made from 100% organic cotton with 380 gsm weight. The thickness measures to 1.5 mm. It uses 2 thread fabric using century old loopwheel machines.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s only 2 countries in the world that have loopwheel machines.\u00a0 One in Japan and the other in Germany. Loopwheel dates back to the 1920s and it\u2019s a special way of knitting cotton yarns in a loopwheel machine.\u00a0 No manufacturer does this anymore because it\u2019s time consuming, inefficient and very expensive.</p>\n<p>But this loopwheeled process gives each tee its own individual characteristics. \u00a0The texture is semi rough and it has a horizontal slubby look.\u00a0 It also makes these tees more durable, hold its shape better and doesn\u2019t stretch out.</p>\n<p>Because of the loopwheel process, there are no side seams on this tee giving it a more natural drape which means this tee will never lose its shape.</p>\n<p>Something that I haven't seen from other brands are the triangle gussets at the armpit. This extra fabric will give you more flexibility and comfort.</p>\n<p>$140 euros is the most expensive tee I\u2019ve ever owned.\u00a0 With that price, I expect perfection and with the construction of this tee, I get just that.\u00a0 Every seam and stitch is excellent with no noticeable flaws.</p>\n<p>But if I had to be nitpicky, there\u2019s a couple of things that I wish this tee did differently. \u00a0First, I wish they used pre-shrunk fabric, instead, expect this shirt to shrink at least 1.5\u201d after the first wash. So you definitely have to go up one size.</p>\n<p>And second, I wish this tee had a reinforced tape like fabric to give that neckline and shoulder seams a more clean and finished look.\u00a0 Or sew the shoulder seam down with a top stitch so it doesn\u2019t flop left and right.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Other than that, this tee is constructed flawlessly.</p>\n<p>Fabric: 9/10</p>\n<p>Workmanship 10/10</p>\n<p>Value: 7/10</p>\n<p>Total score: 26/30</p>\n<h1>Final Rankings/TLDR</h1>\n<ol>\n<li>Merz B.

A year in a half in, they send an email pausing the program for 6 months. That was almost 9 months ago, and now I guess they are under new ownership and not honoring the program. I paid a lot of money for that subscription, and I feel like I've been totally ripped off. I have since filed a complaint with TN Attorney General, Division of Consumer Affairs. You should file a report as well if you participated in the 5 for 5 Club.

            "content_html": "<p>Wythe is one of my favorite brands right now. Great combo of Americana, Western, and Prep/Ivy, which is sort of exactly my style right now. Not inexpensive, but recommended if you're into this quality/price tier.</p>\n<p><strong>Deal:</strong> 30% Off Fall/Winter Select Items (automatically applied in cart; couldn't find any other codes available)</p>\n<p><strong>Link</strong><br />\n- <a href=\"https://wythenewyork.com/collections/sale\">https://wythenewyork.com/collections/sale</a></p>\n<p><strong>About</strong><br />\n- Founded in 2020 by Peter Middleton, who is ex-Ralph Lauren.<br />\n- Started with some great old-school OCBDs. Lots of success since then with flannels and western-inspired stuff, especially their moleskin pearlsnaps, which are are like LL Bean chamois shirts but in a western-style.</p>\n<p><strong>Sale Highlights</strong>: Looks like only about a 1/4 of their total items are included in the sale, but see below for some highlights.</p>\n<p><strong>Washed Flannels ($188 MSRP -&gt; $132 Sale)</strong><br />\n- Crazy soft, like an old super washed flannel basically.<br />\n- A bunch of cool colorways available in both workshirt and pearl snap versions.<br />\n- I picked up the Cherry Blossom workshirt in this sale: <a href=\"https://wythenewyork.com/products/washed-flannel-workshirt-cherry-blossom\">https://wythenewyork.com/products/washed-flannel-workshirt-cherry-blossom</a><br />\n- These run somewhat large in the chest, but I wouldn't go down in size. They work well a little loose given they're so soft.</p>\n<p><strong>Moleskin Pearlsnaps ($188 MSRP -&gt; $132 Sale)</strong><br />\n- Nice brushed moleskin, much like the LL Bean or J.Crew chamois shirts.<br />\n- Lots of great solid colors available. I grabbed the Nectar one myself recently: <a href=\"https://wythenewyork.com/products/moleskin-pearlsnap-shirt-nectar\">https://wythenewyork.com/products/moleskin-pearlsnap-shirt-nectar</a><br />\n- I would go up a size on these since they run slimmer than the washed flannels, at least in the current versions. (Wythe has been known to be a bit inconsistent in sizing year over year.)<br />\n- I bought a Large via Huckberry a few weeks back, but swapped for an XL and am much happier with that size.</p>\n<p><strong>Heavyweight Pinpoint Canvas Barn Jacket ($298 MSRP -&gt; $209 Sale)</strong><br />\n- <a href=\"https://wythenewyork.com/products/pinpoint-canvas-barn-jacket-brown\">https://wythenewyork.com/products/pinpoint-canvas-barn-jacket-brown</a><br />\n- <a href=\"https://wythenewyork.com/products/pinpoint-canvas-barn-jacket-blue\">https://wythenewyork.com/products/pinpoint-canvas-barn-jacket-blue</a><br />\n- I picked this up recently for 50% off elsewhere, and it's pretty great. Very cool play on a chore coat. Not too heavy, not too light. Cool details.<br />\n- Check dimensions, but I expect your normal size should work with this one.</p>\n<p><strong>Japanese Wabash Stripe Moleskin Ranch Jacket ($438 MSRP -&gt; $307 Sale)</strong><br />\n- <a href=\"https://wythenewyork.com/products/japanese-wabash-stripe-moleskin-ranch-jacket-charcoal-smoke\">https://wythenewyork.com/products/japanese-wabash-stripe-moleskin-ranch-jacket-charcoal-smoke</a><br />\n- Same vibe and silhouette as a trucker jacket, but more interesting IMO.<br />\n- I grabbed this recently for 50% off, but still a good buy at 30% off if you're in the market.<br />\n- Def check the dimensions and most likely size up one.

I chimed in and said I had the same concerns. A few people asked for more information, but I typed it from the airport as I left on a business trip, so wasn't able to type it up. I figured I'd post it here in case there is still interest (feel free to remove if it violates some rule).</p>\n<p>These might matter to you, or not, but hopefully they help you make the call if the Vietnamese ones are what you're looking for.</p>\n<p>For the pictures below, the bright green is Canadian-made (and has been worn several times) and the faded green is Vietnamese-made.</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong></p>\n<p>The biggest difference to me is size, I've owned a few Canadian made solotex polos and they were all effectively identical in size. I ordered 3 Vietnamese made polo shirts on black friday and all of them were smaller, but exactly how much varied. For example, the chest measurements were anywhere from 1 to 3 inches less than the Canadian versions, the stomachs also 1-3 (though not aligning with the chest), the sleeves were anywhere from the same to around 1 CM shorter, etc.</p>\n<p>The Vietnamese-made shirt is also around 10% lighter, though I'm not sure if that is due to size differences, less material, thinner material, or some combination of that.</p>\n<p><strong>Collar</strong></p>\n<p>Maybe this is better suited for size, but the Vietnamese all have smaller collars (around 1 CM smaller) than the Canadian made versions. See picture.</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/1swid7dxufae1.jpg?width=1478&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae5fa53d0a7cb91a697a8dfa5853f855aed27926</p>\n<p><strong>Fabric Backing</strong></p>\n<p>On the Canadian-made model, anywhere that was going to move a lot - the collar, the placard, the hem, and the edge of the sleeve, all had thicker, more substantial polyester fabric backing them. On the Vietnamese-made models, they use a 2nd layer of solotex. This makes the Vietnamese made versions less structured, and the collar and sleeves are far more likely to curl up when being worn. It is also more puffy looking, though you probably wouldn't notice it if you didn't hold them up next to one another.</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/9956l1kivfae1.jpg?width=1478&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8cac31d7bcf926c35aba9f51c78c219d76386e01</p>\n<p><strong>Tags and Other Branding</strong></p>\n<p>The tag that comes with the shirt, along with the loop wheel along the sweat band, are both made of way lighter fabric, and are sewn on with non-contrast threads. I don't personally use that loop - not sure if anyone does - but I would worry about the new one ripping out if I did.</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/c08w8dezvfae1.jpg?width=1478&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0578df1e6db254f0f25951e7738215d414d5c419</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/q3og0q70wfae1.jpg?width=1478&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e6eed6b6727b406b0f49bdaf4e95d5af7614c29</p>\n<p><strong>Side Logo</strong></p>\n<p>The logo on the side is no longer a fabric panel that is stitched on, but a really cheap feeling and cheap looking rubberized sticker that likely won't last more than a few washes before cracking.</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/an7imu5bwfae1.jpg?width=2627&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a44ef2124ec075fe759b2aea75cdab7d55bbed7</p>\n<p><strong>Gusset</strong></p>\n<p>The Canadian-made version has a small gusset (the little cut out that helps the shirt move) at the bottom. This was removed on the Vietnamese made model. In it's place Reigning Champ added a panel that runs the length of the shirt along each side, but it's made of identical material to the rest of the shirt, so it doesn't offer any extra stretch.</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/pwjb1cvpwfae1.jpg?width=2627&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=350c9de71da9b462d27fed3813c881f55acb51b4</p>\n<p><strong>Stitching</strong></p>\n<p>The Canadian version uses substantially thicker thread for the stitching, both along the seems and the the hem stitching, though at a lower density. The Vietnamese-made shirts certainly feel less durable in their threads, but I have not worn any of those more than once yet, so in fairness to them I can't say durability will be worse.</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/q03sifuaxfae1.jpg?width=1478&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=891a5d478fcc9f3dcf8d0ec7d8b38bef67d129d4</p>",

Really cool designs, though the pieces are typically more expensive than comparable pieces from American or Japanese brands. Mostly made overseas, though quality is still really high. \n- Purple Label / RLPL is Ralph Lauren\u2019s highest end menswear label. Think luxury fabrics, Loro Piana, Brunello, and the like. Don\u2019t own any RLPL personally, but quality seems impeccable from what I\u2019ve seen in store. Value is a different question\u2026</p>\n<p>Notes:\n- 30% off is the highest discount you\u2019ll ever see for RRL &amp; RLPL on the RL website. The normal holiday sales and codes don\u2019t apply typically to these brands, and the sale periods are limited to just a few post-season times. \n- Only the seasonal/unique releases ever seem to go on sale. The core items like denim, cashmere cardigans, etc. don\u2019t typically ever go on sale, at least for RRL. \n- However, core items do go on sale at other retailers, and the discounts on the seasonal stuff can be &gt;30% elsewhere, so def shop around to make sure the 30% off is the best price available.\n- Unfortunately available sizes appear to be limited on many items. </p>\n<p>Disclaimer:\n- My sister-in-law is a RRL designer, which is one reason I\u2019m very familiar with the brand. I can also get discounted items anytime I want. But I\u2019d be into RRL even if I had no personal affiliation. Very much the style I\u2019m into right now. </p>",

So a decent time to buy if need something, but also fine to skip if there's nothing you specifically need right now.</p>\n<p>Some items I think are solid at this price:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Dock Peacoat ($156.50, 61% Off)<br />\n- Final sale, only blk left, no navy<br />\n- I have a 100% wool one from a prior gent that I got used, and you can get great deals on eBay or Poshmark for J.Crew and Schott peacoat. But the current version is good for folks that like to buy new.<br />\n- <a href=\"https://www.jcrew.com/p/mens/categories/clothing/coats-and-jackets/peacoat/CB744\">https://www.jcrew.com/p/mens/categories/clothing/coats-and-jackets/peacoat/CB744</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Rivington Topcoats ($196.50 to $236.50, 60% Off)<br />\n- These look pretty decent for in-season overcoats, and quality &amp; thickness seemed solid in-store.<br />\n- But they are final sale, so should probably try on first or get specific fit rec from someone who has one<br />\n- <a href=\"https://www.jcrew.com/search?term=rivington\">https://www.jcrew.com/search?term=rivington</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Cruiser Jacket ($116.50, 61% Off)<br />\n- Filson-style, but in a much cheaper wool blend.<br />\n- Quality seemed decent enough in-store, but I'd probably keep waiting on this one unless desperate to get a Filson knock-off now.<br />\n- <a href=\"https://www.jcrew.com/p/mens/categories/clothing/coats-and-jackets/peacoat/cruiser-jacket-in-double-faced-wool-blend/CB780\">https://www.jcrew.com/p/mens/categories/clothing/coats-and-jackets/peacoat/cruiser-jacket-in-double-faced-wool-blend/CB780</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Brushed Wool Overshirt ($76.50, 61% Off)<br />\n- Decent price for a 100% wool overshirt.<br />\n- Not the thickest wool, but good price for 100% wool in-season. The green herringbone one in particular is nice.<br />\n- <a href=\"https://www.jcrew.com/p/mens/categories/clothing/brushed-wool-overshirt/CC977\">https://www.jcrew.com/p/mens/categories/clothing/brushed-wool-overshirt/CC977</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sussex Quilted Jacket ($76.50, 61% Off)<br />\n- Can get for less on the used market, but not by a ton.<br />\n- <a href=\"https://www.jcrew.com/p/mens/categories/clothing/coats-and-jackets/quilted-jacket/sussex-quilted-jacket-with-primaloftreg/CB622\">https://www.jcrew.com/p/mens/categories/clothing/coats-and-jackets/quilted-jacket/sussex-quilted-jacket-with-primaloftreg/CB622</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Shawl Collar Cardigan ($62.50, 60% Off)<br />\n- I got this last year for $67 (57% off) to try out shawl collar cardigans for the first time, so pricing is at a good buy point.<br />\n- They definitely got the styling right. Excellent thick collar, like you see on the more expensive ones. Decent enough material for the price.<br />\n- I later upgraded to an awesome Todd Snyder one for \\~$100 via eBay, and you can get nicer ones from Spier &amp; Mackay for $160-200, but this item is a good entry point to this style of sweater.<br />\n- <a href=\"https://www.jcrew.com/p/mens/categories/clothing/sweaters/cardigan/rugged-merino-wool-blend-cardigan-sweater/BA217\">https://www.jcrew.com/p/mens/categories/clothing/sweaters/cardigan/rugged-merino-wool-blend-cardigan-sweater/BA217</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Heavyweight Chamois Workshirt ($54.50, 61% Off)<br />\n- Cheaper now than the LL Bean ones. Perhaps slightly thicker than Bean chamois? Definitely more fitted and not as long as Bean, so easier to wear untucked. Recommended.<br />\n- <a href=\"https://www.jcrew.com/p/mens/categories/clothing/coats-and-jackets/shirt-jacket/heavyweight-chamois-workshirt/BK216\">https://www.jcrew.com/p/mens/categories/clothing/coats-and-jackets/shirt-jacket/heavyweight-chamois-workshirt/BK216</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>770 Five-Pocket Corduroy Pants ($36.50, 63% Off)<br />\n- I have two pairs of these and they are great at this price if you like the 770 cut.<br />\n- <a href=\"https://www.jcrew.com/m/mens/categories/clothing/pants-and-chinos/corduroy/770trade-straight-fit-pant-in-corduroy/MP460\">https://www.jcrew.com/m/mens/categories/clothing/pants-and-chinos/corduroy/770trade-straight-fit-pant-in-corduroy/MP460</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Cashmere Scarf ($36.50, 63% Off)<br />\n- I have the Navy one, and it's totally fine if cashmere is important to you in a scarf.<br />\n- <a href=\"https://www.jcrew.com/m/womens/categories/accessories/scarves-and-gloves/solid-cashmere-scarf/MP625\">https://www.jcrew.com/m/womens/categories/accessories/scarves-and-gloves/solid-cashmere-scarf/MP625</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There are also some solid deals in the \"Sale\" section, such as the regular tech pants, sueded polos, some linen pants and shirts.</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/3ehgfi1ohm5e1.png?width=2000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=487e7c6fcd958742046d8db18d466c99023160b3</p>",

Not a single impressive deal so far, by my standards. UBs going for $135 when last year we were hitting $60s-70s on the regular. J Crew Ludlows at like $380 for normal colors when we just had Spier &amp; Mackay @ $250 (and no, the uninformed chat guy at JC does <em>not</em> give you the proper measurements; enjoy the extra $100+ for tailoring). The rest of the JC lineup of shirts/pants \"deals\" at \\~$50+ (hard maybe on the Baird linen stuff, but the fit is way off for me; again, tailoring adds too much extra). I'm sorry, just not seeing it. Only deal I've seen so far has been Joe's NB fresh foam @ $25 factoring in honey cashback, which who knows these days if these POS cashback sites will even work, or if you'll just be fighting with their customer service for weeks. Super unimpressed so far. Let me know if I'm way off, but it's not even just fashion. I think there's actually been far less actual deals this week than a typical week.</p>",

But looks like they've turned on a better sale starting today.</p>\n<p>Note: I couldn't get the new subscriber 15% off code to work, but will try that again later before I get anything.</p>\n<p>Some core items I own that are 50% off or more:</p>\n<p>Heritage Cotton Crewneck Sweater ($44.50, 50% Off)<br />\n- <a href=\"https://www.jcrew.com/m/mens/categories/clothing/sweaters/crewneck/MP443\">https://www.jcrew.com/m/mens/categories/clothing/sweaters/crewneck/MP443</a><br />\n- Nice heavyweight cotton, good colors, much thicker than their other cotton sweaters, attractive raglan sleeves.</p>\n<p>Broken-In Organic Cotton Oxford Shirt ($44.50, 50% Off)<br />\n- <a href=\"https://www.jcrew.com/p/mens/categories/clothing/shirts/broken-in-oxford/broken-in-organic-cotton-oxford-shirt/BE996\">https://www.jcrew.com/p/mens/categories/clothing/shirts/broken-in-oxford/broken-in-organic-cotton-oxford-shirt/BE996</a><br />\n- This seems to be the biggest regular discount they give on the good colors for this shirt. If J.Crew fits you well, it's a solid choice at this price point. Spier &amp; Mackay would potentially be better quality if can get their sizing to work for you.</p>\n<p>Garment-Dyed Corduroy CPO Shirt ($44.50, 50% Off)<br />\n- <a href=\"https://www.jcrew.com/p/mens/categories/clothing/shirts/corduroy/BJ464\">https://www.jcrew.com/p/mens/categories/clothing/shirts/corduroy/BJ464</a><br />\n- This one just arrived for me. Soft and pretty thick. Good choice if looking for a winter workshirt.</p>\n<p>Baird McNutt Irish Linen Shirt ($48.50, 51% Off)<br />\n- <a href=\"https://www.jcrew.com/m/mens/categories/clothing/shirts/linen/baird-mcnutt-irish-linen-shirt/MP123\">https://www.jcrew.com/m/mens/categories/clothing/shirts/linen/baird-mcnutt-irish-linen-shirt/MP123</a><br />\n- This also appears to be the deepest they discount these linen shirts in the core colors. Very solid at this price. Can't even buy them on eBay for much cheaper than this. Available in short-sleeve for 50% off as well.</p>\n<p>Heavyweight Chamois Shirt ($64.50, 53% Off)<br />\n- <a href=\"https://www.jcrew.com/p/mens/categories/clothing/coats-and-jackets/shirt-jacket/heavyweight-chamois-workshirt/BK216\">https://www.jcrew.com/p/mens/categories/clothing/coats-and-jackets/shirt-jacket/heavyweight-chamois-workshirt/BK216</a><br />\n- I picked up one of these on eBay for cheap and am very happy with it. Better fit and slightly thicker than the LL Bean traditional chamois.</p>\n<p>Sussex Quilted Jacket ($94.50, 52% Off)<br />\n- <a href=\"https://www.jcrew.com/p/mens/categories/clothing/coats-and-jackets/quilted-jacket/sussex-quilted-jacket-with-primaloftreg/CB622\">https://www.jcrew.com/p/mens/categories/clothing/coats-and-jackets/quilted-jacket/sussex-quilted-jacket-with-primaloftreg/CB622</a><br />\n- Comparable to Barbour quilted jackets. You can find them on eBay for less, but still a good choice at this price if unsure of sizing.</p>\n<p>6\" Dock Short ($21.20, 69% Off)<br />\n- <a href=\"https://www.jcrew.com/p/mens/categories/clothing/shorts/dock/6quot-dock-short/BE057\">https://www.jcrew.com/p/mens/categories/clothing/shorts/dock/6quot-dock-short/BE057</a><br />\n- These are very solid shorts, I upgraded to them from Amazon Basics drawstring shorts and am enjoying the better quality. This is the lowest price I've seen on these. Looks like the stretch chino shorts are down to a very low price as well.</p>\n<p>Pajama Pant in Cotton Poplin ($18.80, 68% Off)<br />\n- <a href=\"https://www.jcrew.com/m/mens/categories/clothing/underwear-and-pajamas/pajamas/pajama-pant-in-cotton-poplin/MP160\">https://www.jcrew.com/m/mens/categories/clothing/underwear-and-pajamas/pajamas/pajama-pant-in-cotton-poplin/MP160</a><br />\n- Nice basic lightweight pajama pants. Much better than a similar pair I had from Gap.</p>\n<p>I also really like the Heritage 14oz fleece sweatshirt and sweatpants, but those are only 39% off. These sweats seem to be identical to a Wallace &amp; Barnes sweatshirt I got off eBay that's really nice. These should get to &gt;50% at some point, but the current price point is fine if you are in the market immediately.</p>\n<p>They also added cashmere items to the sale and some of the nice wool overcoats are &gt;50% off or more, but I can't speak to any of those personally.</p>\n<p>Happy Thanksgiving!</p>",
