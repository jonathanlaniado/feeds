This time I tried <strong>10 joggers under $40.</strong></p>\n<p>If you\u2019re like me, you\u2019re probably wondering why are joggers so expensive. In my mind, they are fancy sweatpants so when I see a pair of Lululemons going for $120, I have a hard time justifying the price.</p>\n<p>But I wanted to find out for myself. I bought 20 pairs of joggers from budget Hanes that are $12 to high end Lululemons that cost $120. I wanted to find the best pair of joggers, regardless of the cost. This post is all about the 10 budget joggers. In my next post I\u2019ll be covering the 10 high end joggers which are around $100.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve also made a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/7sXYbqcjisY\"><strong><em>video</em></strong></a> of this review, in case you wanted to see what they look like on me. For reference I\u2019m 5\u20199 and 190 pounds. All joggers in this Haul are size L.</p>\n<h1>#1 Hanes EcoSmart Non-Pocket Sweatpants - $12.50</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>50% cotton and 50% polyester</li>\n<li>These are cheap and for the price pretty comfortable, especially for wearing them around the house. It\u2019s not the highest quality, but I\u2019ve had mine or 6 months and they\u2019ve held up pretty well so far. But I don\u2019t recommend them for 2 reasons. First, there\u2019s no pockets which make them not usable at all. And second, the drawstring is a single loop so it\u2019s kind of difficult to cinch the waist. I actually had to watch a Youtube video to figure out how to tie these things. They are affordable but they are not practical at all so I don\u2019t recommend them. <strong>I would pick the Gap Vintage Soft joggers over these.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h1>#2 Southpole Jogger Fleece Pants - $15</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>100% polyester</li>\n<li>These are the Amazon best sellers for sweatpants. These are decent, they\u2019re comfortable and feel very soft. They are fleece lined so with spring and summer coming up they are going to be too warm. Personally, I\u2019ll be returning these but if you\u2019re looking for a pair of fleece sweatpants for the winter these are probably the best deal out there. I own another fleece sweatpants from Abercrombie and those are around $60. The A&amp;F sweatpants are better quality but these are definitely comparable to those. The quality is lower, but for $15 they get the job done.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>#3 Zara Slim Fit Jogger Pants - $40</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>97% cotton and 3% elastane</li>\n<li>Man, I really really wish these would fit better. As a guy with big legs these are too tight all around. I love the way they look and feel, but they are too small. They are too tight and too restricting in the legs area, especially when I sit down. The waist band is not very stretchy, so even just putting them on feels like a task. chore. It\u2019s a bummer because these are great looking joggers. If you guys are looking for something trendy and stylish though check out the Zara website for joggers, they have tons of models and different styles and they all look pretty good.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>#4 Gap Slim Canvas Joggers - $39</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>98% cotton and 2% elastane</li>\n<li>These are the second structured pair of joggers in this Haul and these are decent, but I don\u2019t really love the fit. They fit straight through the leg and only taper at the very bottom. I personally am looking for something slimmer that hugs the leg a little more.  The fabric is stretchy so they are comfortable even when sitting down. I wish they were a little softer. They have this cool to the touch feeling, which I personally don\u2019t care for.  I\u2019ll return these because <strong>for $40 the H&amp;M reviewed below are a better deal.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h1>#5 Champion Powerblend Retro Jogger - $23</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>50% cotton and 50% polyester</li>\n<li>These are the sweatpants that everyone is recommending online but I personally don\u2019t think they are worth it. The fit is a little slimmer in the legs, but otherwise fits okay. But the material is not very good. It feels synthetic, light and just not very high quality. The cuffs on the bottom are super loose already. These sweatpants feel like they will wear out with every wash and won\u2019t be very durable.So don\u2019t recommend these. For the same price, the <strong>Goodthreads reviewed below are a better deal all around.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h1>#6 [Best Lightweight] Gap Vintage Soft Joggers - $55 but on sale for $27</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>77% cotton and 14% polyester and 9% recycled materials</li>\n<li>I loved these. Probably the most lightweight and comfortable sweatpants in this haul. They have inner lining, so they are extremely soft. When I\u2019m wearing these I barely feel like I\u2019m wearing anything at all. For me these are the perfect Sunday lounger sweatpants. They are baggy, roomy, comfortable and great all around. I\u2019m not sure how they would hold up after few washes, but on initial impression these are very nice. The regular price is $55 but if you buy an off-color one, like the blue I got, they are around $27 which I think is a great deal. These are the best baggy, lounger sweatpants all around.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>#7 Old Navy Modern Jogger - $40</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>98% cotton and 2% elastane</li>\n<li>I didn\u2019t like these. They don\u2019t fit me and the material is too harsh, they feel canvas-y a little bit. They\u2019re too large in the waist but if I size them down they will be too tight in the legs.  Even though there\u2019s 2% elastane there\u2019s not a whole lot of stretch, so when I sit down these press against my knees and they don\u2019t feel very comfortable. I returned these because for the same price, the H&amp;M or the Zara are better quality joggers.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>#8 [Best Value] Uniqlo Mens Sweatpants - $30</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>90% cotton and 10% poly</li>\n<li>These are amazing! Seriously, along with the Gap these are the second best sweatpants in this Haul hands down! They are super comfortable and soft. They are mostly cotton so they feel natural and breathable. The cotton feels kind of ribbed so they are really soft on the touch. They\u2019re maybe a little longer in the bottom, but I don\u2019t mind it since they are cuffed. These joggers come the closest to the Lululemon City Sweat. In my video I show them side by side and you can see that they are pretty similar in how they look and they are pretty similar in the comfort level as well. These are only $30 compared to the Lulus which are $120. The Lulus feel more premium, they have more technical material in them and they\u2019re a little more structured, but <strong>for $30 I think these are incredible sweatpants and I recommend them 100%.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h1>#9 [Best Heavyweight] Goodthreads Fleece Jogger Pants - $27</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>90% cotton and 10% polyester</li>\n<li>These feel like high quality sweatpants and they are the best heavyweight sweatpants all around. They are soft and feel natural and there\u2019s plenty of breathing room. They have a little heavier fabric so you feel them on when you wear them. They feel similar to Uniqlo, very natural and not synthetic at all but they are heavier. These run a little big because the Large is too large on me, it\u2019s too wide in the waist and also super long.  I\u2019ll probably return these though cause I don\u2019t need another pair of sweatpants and these are in the middle of the pack, but I think for the money they fare well worth it. Definitely <strong>recommend these over the Champions</strong> if you want more heavyweight sweatpants.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>#10 [Best Structured] H&amp;M Regular Fit Twill Joggers - $25</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>98% cotton and 2% spandex</li>\n<li>Best value joggers all around. I love the way these feel, they are soft and there\u2019s a little bit of stretch to them. They feel similar to the Zara ones, but are $15 cheaper. This particular pair is too large on me, they are too big in the waist and too long. But I already ordered a pair of Medium and they just came yesterday and they fit perfectly.  At $25 these are incredible deal and the best structured joggers in the entire Haul. If you\u2019re looking for a pair of joggers you can wear outside, and even at the office, these are the ones!</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Summing up</h1>\n<p>Thank you guys for reading this far down. I\u2019m going to wait to make a keep/return decision after I try on the high end joggers. But if I had to pick the best joggers from this haul, here\u2019s my top picks:</p>\n<p><strong>Best Value Overall</strong> - Uniqlo Mens Sweatpants</p>\n<p><strong>Best Lightweight</strong> - Gap Vintage Soft</p>\n<p><strong>Best Heavyweight</strong> -  Goodthreads Fleece Jogger</p>\n<p><strong>Best Structured</strong>  -  H&amp;M Regular Fit Twill Joggers</p></div>",

It's what my parents dressed me in when I was a child. I love that they're simple yet timeless and a classy alternative to normal tees while being just as laid back. When it gets as hot as it does in Texas, polos have been a great way to put more effort into an outfit while still staying cool.</p>\n<p>For this head to head, I've included only pique polos since they're the most common. Pique is that woven, waffle textured material known for its breathability and flexibility. I've selected this range by browsing blogs, Reddit posts, other YouTube videos and fashion magazines and then narrowed it down to the most popular ones. If there are some you really like that I didn't include, leave them in the comments and I'll look into them for a potential part 2.</p>\n<p>My ideal polo is one that gets 4 things right: fit, fabric, collar, and overall construction.</p>\n<p>For fit I want it to drapes well, hugs the arms and is fitted in the chest but is leaves room around the stomach. I'm looking for the sleeves to end mid bicep and the length to hit mid crotch. A split hem is an added bonus since I have larger thighs. In terms of quality, I look for a solid, structured collar and attention to detail throughout.</p>\n<p>For reference, I\u2019m 5\u201910\u201d, 175-180 lbs. These are all a small or medium. I went off the measurements on the size charts.</p>\n<h1>Uniqlo</h1>\n<p>We'll start with the cheapest and work our way up. Uniqlo Dry Pique Short Sleeve Polo Shirt came in right around $20 and I honestly don't have many complaints at this price point.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fit</strong>:</li>\n<li>I went true to size with medium. It was one of the  most relaxed of the bunch when it comes to fit which results in longer than ideal sleeve lengths. The shoulder and length are perfect but I do have a bit of extra fabric around my underarms which results in the chest not being as fitted as I prefer.</li>\n<li><strong>Fabric</strong>:</li>\n<li>There's not much to talk about regarding the fabric. It's nothing special but gets the job done. The pique fabric weave is on the tighter end resulting in less texture and stretch but a smoother feel.</li>\n<li><strong>Construction</strong>:</li>\n<li>The single layer collar on this shirt is on the flimsy end and looks to be made of the same ribbed material as the cuffs. The placket is nice and deep and the plastic buttons are expected at this price point. I like the split hem and the ribbed cuffs. Uniqlo sells it in 9 colors at the moment but they rotate the options frequently.</li>\n<li><strong>Thoughts:</strong></li>\n<li>Although it's not my favorite, I've been wearing this quite a lot as it's different to every other polo I own. I've been really into oversized tees recently and I think that may play a part in me wearing this one more frequently. It's looser fit creates a nice contrast when paired with some slimmer bottoms and sneakers. According to the reviews under the polo on their website, Uniqlo seems to tweak these yearly so I'm not sure how long this info will be true. Overall, it's a great polo for $20 but might not look as tailored and polished as most guys would want a polo to look.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Kent Wang</h1>\n<p>I had no idea about this brand until I saw a post on a subreddit on this while doing research for the vid. I got my hands on this white one in a size medium that goes for $65.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fit:</strong></li>\n<li>Kent Wang claims these to be very slim fit, saying it's even slimmer than Zara and Ralph Lauren's custom fit. Reading this, I ordered a medium and a large so I could compare the two. Although the polo was on the slimmer end of the spectrum, it wasn't by too much in my opinion. The top fit like a normal custom fit but the stomach was slimmer than the rest. The large was a bit too baggy for my liking but the medium was just about right. The sleeves land right where I want them and the chest is perfect. The stomach area leaves <strong><em>just</em></strong> enough room for me but it's cutting it close. If it were any slimmer and I think it would be too tight for my liking. The length was longer than the rest causing some slight bunching around the waist.</li>\n<li><strong>Fabric:</strong></li>\n<li>It's not fair to call this fabric stiff by any means but let's say it's the most structured of the batch. That being said, it's still that normal pique fabric so it feels similar to what you would expect it to. The weave isn't too tight or too loose, and felt comparable to Ralph Lauren.</li>\n<li><strong>Construction:</strong></li>\n<li>The highlight of this polo has to be the collar. It is constructed with the same material as the rest of the polo. Made of a collar band and two layers fabric, I found this to be much stronger than the typical single layer. I've washed this many time and the collar has not lost its shape at all. The spread collar and the way its constructed makes it naturally want to stand up tall in an elegant way. The placket is a perfect depth and features three mother-of-pearl buttons. The buttons and super thick and hefty in a good way. I liked the three buttons as they gave me the flexibility to wear the polo as casual or as dressed up as I wanted.</li>\n<li><strong>Thoughts:</strong></li>\n<li>Kent Wang seems like a no-nonsense kind of brand. No fancy packaging or marketing, just a brand thats out to bring really good clothing at a competitive price. I really respect that. The polo comes in a ton of different colors. The inner branding seems prone to peeling after some washes but even if that doesn't hold up I still think this is a great polo.</li>\n<li>The price did go up to $75 from $65 but I'd still recommend it as it competes neck in neck with the higher cost options.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Lacoste:</h1>\n<p>Lacoste is considered the OG of the polo world. Although the history of the polo is debated, the first polos come from India in the 1850s. However, it wasn\u2019t until nearly a century later that they started becoming popular when President Eisenhower was seen wearing his Lacoste polo. They retail for $90 but certain colors can be found for around $50 on sale.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fit</strong></li>\n<li>Sizing is weird on this one so I would recommend trying on in store prior to purchasing. I had originally tried on the slim fit in a medium but it was way too tight so ended up going with a classic fit in a small to get that \u201ccustom fit\u201d look I prefer. The classic fit in a medium was too baggy for me. The front and back are the same length making this harder to tuck in than the options with staggered lengths. I love the longer sleeves that still manage to hug the arms.</li>\n<li><strong>Fabric</strong></li>\n<li>The fabric on this polo was thin, lightweight and breathable with the pique being on the finer side. The combination makes it perfect for warmer days. The finer weave makes the polo look like it has less texture compared to the rest and the texture feels near identical to Loro Piana's.</li>\n<li><strong>Construction</strong></li>\n<li>The collar was disappointing on an otherwise great polo. It\u2019s made from a ribbed cotton material that curl very easily. The deep placket helped give it a more upscale look in my opinion and the grey buttons were a nice touch.</li>\n<li><strong>Thoughts</strong></li>\n<li>Im going to be honest, I never really gave Lacoste a shot before this comparison but I really liked this polo. Everything from it\u2019s rich history to the plethora of colors available makes this a solid choice. If it wasn\u2019t for the collars, I could see myself having multiples of these in my wardrobe.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Ralph Lauren</h1>\n<p>As Lacoste was gaining steam for its Polo amongst college students going for an athleisure look at the time, it was Ralph Lauren who took the concept mainstream internationally. My parents used to get these for me on clearance when I was super young and paired it with jean shorts or chinos. Something about that new england dress code stuck with me and was my daily uniform growing up.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fit</strong></li>\n<li>Getting right into it, I\u2019ve worn a custom fit medium for years now. It\u2019s very easy to find the perfect fit as Ralph Lauren offers three fits: the classic, the custom fit and a slim fit and 6 sizes XS to XXL. Speaking for the custom fit, it hugs the arms and chest and tapers towards the waist. The length is an inch or two short for my preference but it\u2019s worth the tradeoff since everything else fits well. I\u2019ve had a few shirts shrink more than others so size accordingly if it isn\u2019t the classic mesh fabric.</li>\n<li><strong>Fabric</strong></li>\n<li>The fabric is alright. It\u2019s normal polo pique fabric that\u2019s not soft or stiff, not lightweight or heavy. Just average across the board. That being said, it gets the job done.</li>\n<li><strong>Construction</strong></li>\n<li>Another polos whose collars really disappointed. It\u2019s made of a very similar construction to Lacoste's. l really like the slightly staggered front and back with the rear being roughly an inch longer. Fit and finish are on par and the shorter placket lets you get away with not buttoning up without looking too obnoxious.</li>\n<li><strong>Thoughts</strong></li>\n<li>90% of the polos in my closet were from Ralph Lauren prior to me putting this episode together. I love them for the nostalgia but in terms of quality and price, there are definitely better options out there. Ralph Lauren has a ton of colors available so that's another plus. They retail for $95 but it\u2019s fairly easy to find them much cheaper at department stores or off season.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Sunspel</h1>\n<p>The Sunspel Riviera polo was the one I was most excited to try on this list. It was made in 2006 for Daniel Craig to wear in Casino Royale but Sunspel has been around since the 1800s. Sunspel oozes heritage and innovation throughout the years.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fit</strong></li>\n<li>I ordered mine in a size medium in the Forest color way. It fit true to size and I\u2019ve had no shrinkage over many washes. The polo is trim but not overly slim. The sleeves hit right at your mid-bicep and did not restrict my movement.</li>\n<li><strong>Fabric</strong></li>\n<li>The fabric is exceptional. This polo had the widest and loosest weave out of all the others that I tested. The best way I could describe it was wearing a jersey made from some of the softest cotton.</li>\n<li><strong>Construction</strong></li>\n<li>The collar is made from two layers of the same material as the shirt itself. It looks very polished and I was surprised how structured it remained with the rest of the shirt being so open and airy. They opted to go for a monochromatic look with matching plastic buttons. It\u2019s a cool look and are constructed really well but I feel like they cheap\u2019d out with plastic at this price. The pocket was also something I wasn\u2019t the biggest fan of since it makes the shirt look more casual but that just comes down to personal preference.</li>\n<li><strong>Thoughts</strong></li>\n<li>There\u2019s just something about wearing James Bonds polo that give you a little extra pep in your step. I love the fabric especially on days where you have to look put together and the temperatures are in the upper 90s. The fit, fabric, and construction were all solid and all lived up to my expectations. I bought mine for $150 but I\u2019ve been seeing them on sale for $64 on their site recently depending on color.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Loro Piana</h2>\n<p>I\u2019ve been drawn to this Italian brand for a while now but have never owned a piece from them. I had heard that their fabrics were exceptional and were the ultimate combination of quality and luxury. I figured I would head to the nearest boutique to get the full experience. I walked in to be half greeted by the sales associates only to be taken seriously after I told them I was looking to purchase a polo. I told them I wanted their classic pique polo to which they were slightly confused as they pulled some vicuna and cashmere polos instead. Although they were incredibly supple, the price tag for each were in the thousands. I ended up going with the cotton one for a whopping $545 before taxes in a size medium in the optic white color.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fit</strong></li>\n<li>Alright, so what exactly does nearly $600 for a cotton polo get you and is it really 30x as good as the Uniqlo we tested. Right off the bat the answer is no but there\u2019s more to it. Lets start with the fit: I went for a medium but didn\u2019t quite love any size I tried on. The cut was boxy and structured but light and flowy all at the same time. The sleeves hit a bit under the middle of your bicep and don\u2019t hug them at all. The shoulders on the medium were about an inch too wide for me but the small was too narrow. The rest of the shirt fit like a traditional classic fit.</li>\n<li><strong>Fabric</strong></li>\n<li>Moving into the fabric. My first impression was how thin it was, upon trying it on it wasn\u2019t see through but you could definitely see my skin tone blend with the white fabric in the areas where the fabric wasn\u2019t double lined. The weave was on the finer side and was most comparable to Lacoste in terms of knit and texture. The fabric felt amazing on skin, silky smooth with a softness I haven\u2019t encountered on a cotton pique polo.</li>\n<li><strong>Construction</strong></li>\n<li>The build quality and fit and finish were exceptional but that\u2019s to be expected on a $600 polo. The placket was the deepest of the batch and the three pearl buttons were super nice. The Loro Piana red stitch was a nice touch on the top button. They opt for a curved hem to make it easier to tuck in however with the fabric being so thin, mine had a tenancy to curl and needed extra ironing after washing to get it to lay flat. The collars were stiff and felt like something off a button down shirt. The collar, deep placket, along with the curved hem really made this feel like a pique button down with three buttons instead of a true polo. That isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing but just something to note.</li>\n<li><strong>Thoughts</strong></li>\n<li>Alright, so if it weren\u2019t for this video, I would never consider going out to spend this sorts of money on a polo. There\u2019s a level of diminishing return for all articles of clothing, where spending twice as much on something doesn\u2019t get you twice the quality. I would say this occurs fairly early for polo shirts. At the end of the day, pique feels near identical throughout the spectrum. So long as you like the fit and construction, there\u2019s no reason to spend close to this much. This is one of those cases where you\u2019re paying for the prestige of the brand rather than the quality they\u2019re putting out.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Summary:</h1>\n<p>This video taught me that it\u2019s really hard to mess up a polo. As long as the polo has the features you prefer you really can\u2019t go wrong. Based on the collar, fabric, fit, and construction and if money were no object I would take Sunspel followed very closely by Kent Wang, Loro Piana, Lacoste, Ralph Lauren then Uniqlo in that order. Being more budget focused, I think I would either save and wait for Sunspel to go on sale or go with Kent Wang before dishing out money on Uniqlo. I think the Sunspel and Kent Wang would last longer and look much better over time compared to the Uniqlo one so that may be worth the extra cost. These had the slimmest margins of any comparison that i\u2019ve done so far so you really can\u2019t go wrong with any.</p>\n<h1>TLDR/Overall Rank if You Just Want the Best:</h1>\n<ol>\n<li>Sunspel</li>\n<li>Kent Wang</li>\n<li>Loro Piana</li>\n<li>Lacoste</li>\n<li>Ralph Lauren</li>\n<li>Uniqlo</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>Budget Friendly Ranking:</h1>\n<ol>\n<li>Sunspel on sale at $64</li>\n<li>Kent Wang ($75) -- I think both these will last longer than the Uniqlo hence the reason I'm ranking them higher, it'll be a lower cost per wear in the long term</li>\n<li>Uniqlo</li>\n<li>Lacoste</li>\n<li>Ralph Lauren</li>\n<li>Loro Piana</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Obviously, this is just my personal opinion based off what I look for. Your order could be the complete opposite and that's okay. Any of these are a solid pick. I'm not expert and just sharing thoughts based on what I like and what I look for. Hope this was somewhat helpful!</p></div>",

This question gets asked so much around here, it\u2019s basically a meme.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re like me though and you have big legs, you probably hate shopping for jeans online. It\u2019s such a pain in the ass that I avoid it as much as possible. Lately though I\u2019ve been needing a  new pair of jeans since my old ones are worn out and don\u2019t fit me anymore. So I decided to try on a bunch of the recommended options here to find the best jeans for me.</p>\n<p>10 jeans and $700 dollars later, I was able to find a few pairs that I actually really  loved. The experience was still annoying though but I was super happy with the few jeans I kept and hopefully I won't have to do this again for a while. Here\u2019s my honest review of each jean I tried and what I liked and didn\u2019t like about it.</p>\n<p>For you visual guys out there, I also made a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt8mm2hzw-M\">Youtube Video</a> that has all the info from below, plus links plus you can see how they fit on me.</p>\n<p>For reference, I\u2019m 5\u20199\u201d and 190lbs. I wear a 34x32 jean size and my thighs are 27in wide.</p>\n<h1>#1 Wrangler\u2019s Regular Taper Jean</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>$26.99, made of 98% cotton and 2% spandex.</li>\n<li>I think these are the best jeans all around. Only $30 but fit really well and are comfortable. There\u2019s plenty of room in the seat area and they\u2019re tapered at the bottom so it looks clean. I own 3 other pairs of these and I use them for working around the house and casually around town. If I could buy just one pair of jeans these would be it.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>#2 Amazon Essentials Athletic Stretch Jean</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>$31.90, made of 98% cotton and 2% elastane</li>\n<li>These are way too big and baggy. They are big in the waist and also super long in the bottom. Definitely size down if you\u2019re thinking about buying these. Also I didn\u2019t love the material, it\u2019s not very soft and they have a course and rough feeling to them.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>#3 Everlane Athletic Stretch Jean</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>$88, made of 94% cotton, 2% elastane and 4% other materials</li>\n<li>By far my favorite jeans in this Haul. These are extremely comfortable and the material feels heavy, like it\u2019s a super high quality. They are is super soft and stretchy. They feel comfortable when sitting down so I can wear this when I work at my desk. The taper on the bottom is perfect too. They are a little large in the waist, so I probably could have sized down to 33x32 with these but they didn\u2019t have this size</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>#4 JCrew 1040 Athletic jean</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>$98, made of 100% cotton even though the website says they should have some stretch material to them.</li>\n<li>I had high hopes for these, but I was super disappointed. There\u2019s barely any stretch to them and they don\u2019t feel comfortable at all. They restrict my movement when walking or even just standing up straight. When I bend down in these, it feels like they\u2019re going to rip any moment. Also at $100 they\u2019re a little overpriced. Do not recommend these for guys with big legs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>#5 Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Athletic Skinny Jeans</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>$78, made of 94% cotton, 4% polyester and 2% elastane.</li>\n<li>These jeans are amazing. They fit really well, and they are soft and stretchy and feel really comfortable. Also they are very fashion forward, more so than any other brand I tried. So these would be perfect for date nights. Definitely in top 3 of this Haul.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>#6 Levis 541\u2122 Athletic Taper Fit</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>$79.50, made of 68% cotton, 31% lyocell and 1% elastane.</li>\n<li>Overpriced. The fit is good but the material feels kind of cheap, they are light weight and there\u2019s too much stretch, at least for my taste. I know these are classics and everyone recommends them, but for the same price, I recommend the Everlane or the Abercrombie instead.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>#7 American Eagle Athletic Fit Jean</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>$39.95, made of 99% cotton and 1% elastane</li>\n<li>Blown away how good these jeans were, and only $40. They're extremely soft and super comfortable. This pair is 33x32 and they fit perfect. They sit just right in the waist area and there\u2019s plenty of room in the seat and leg. I only wish they had more colors on their website. When I checked they only had 3 and I liked the light wash the best.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>#8 Gap Flex Athletic Taper Jeans</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>$70, made of 93% cotton, 5% elastane and 2% spandex</li>\n<li>I loved, loved the color but these jeans are way too short. The inseam feels more like a 30\u2019 instead of 32\u2019. They fit okay in the waist, but are too short on the bottom. When I cuff them up they look like capri pants. Gap is cool though, they have tons of discounts all the time and I\u2019ve never paid full price for anything from them.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>#9 Lucky Brand 411 Athletic Taper</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>$69.30, made of 94% cotton 4% polyester 2% elastane</li>\n<li>Really soft and comfortable. They fit true to size but the taper on the legs is a little too aggressive. They are also a little too stretchy for my taste. I was on the fence with these and almost kept them. I liked them, but I didn\u2019t really love them. I don\u2019t know why but I ended up returning them. Maybe they were just too basic and for $70 I didn\u2019t think they were worth it.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>#10 Lee Men's Legendary Athletic Tapered Leg Jean</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>$32.79, made of 99% cotton and 1% spandex.</li>\n<li>Along with Wranger\u2019s and Amazon Essentials these were the other budget jeans I tried. They were only $32 but they are way too long in the bottom and not tapered at all. They have more of a bootcut leg opening. The fabric feels really soft though, better than the Wranglers or the Amazon Essentials. They stretch and are comfortable when sitting down. For $32 I\u2019d definitely get these if they were to fit me a little better.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Summing up</h1>\n<p>And that was it. I tried 10 pairs and ended up keeping 4. I\u2019m super happy with the jeans I found and I didn\u2019t just settle for the first available brand out there.</p>\n<p>If there\u2019s one thing I learned from this haul is this though: <strong>make sure the jeans you buy have some type of stretch material in them</strong>. 100% cotton will be too restrictive and won't feel comfortable.</p>\n<p>As far as best jeans, here\u2019s my favorite:</p>\n<p><strong>Best overall</strong> --- Wranglers</p>\n<p><strong>Most comfortable</strong> --- Everlane</p>\n<p><strong>Most Fashionable</strong> --- Abercrombie</p>\n<p><strong>Biggest Surprise</strong> --- American Eagle</p></div>",

By my estimate, I have copped ~15 jackets, ~100 tops, ~50 bottoms, ~30 pairs of shoes/boots and ~30 watches. While this sub has saved me a ton of money, I still estimate that I have spent ~$20,000 dollars in the last 3 years. I love the wardrobe that I have built but there is no denying it has become extremely bloated for how frequently I get to utilize it. I\nhave gone well past what can be considered frugal male fashion. I know I am not alone though as reckless spending seems fairly commonplace on this sub. For those just discovering FMF, I figured that I would share my anecdotal experience as a somewhat cautionary tale.</p>\n<p>For frame of reference, I was probably a lot like most who come across this sub. I was in my mid 20s just starting off my career and needed a wardrobe upgrade as I was starting a new job that required business formal dress (which I had very little of at the time). After 2 years at this position, this sub helped me upgrade my style but I spent a LOT of money on formal clothes for work as FMF made it easy. After the pandemic displaced me from my job, I got a new one that requires a very simple uniform and now much of the formal wear I bought never sees the light of day. This means I have a few thousand dollars worth of clothes just lying around never getting worn. It doesn't stop there though, I have made other spending mistakes that are more my own doing but I hope share some of them to help others avoid making them and truly use this sub to stay frugal.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Impulse buying is killer. The true deals and deep discounts are at the end of season. Buying EOS also forces you to think ahead and reduces impulse buying. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Think from a cost effective standpoint about how much wear an item will get. Most people only go \"out\" in nicer casual clothing at most 1-2 times/week. Formal clothing (if you don't have a job that requires it) gets worn maybe 4 times/year. It is easy to blow thousands on these two categories and get little to no wear out of them over the course of a year making their cost per wear very high.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Lifespan of clothes. The average article of clothing lasts for 3.3 years (unless they're from Shein). Ask yourself if you will still see yourself wearing something 3 years from now before buying it. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Work clothes. Make sure you know the dress code of your chosen career before investing heavily in a certain clothing category.\nPrioritize clothes that can be worn for work AND personal life. Work clothes will likely be the ones you spend the most time in so those will take priority but if items can be worn for work and more casual settings than that's a win/win and more versatility to your wardrobe.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The \"1 in; 1 out rule\" is flawed. It isn't frugal if it justifies more spending and more donating clothes that still have life. 90% of donations get thrown away. As someone who is eco and cost concious, this one resonates with me as I felt bad once I learned most of my donations were just being thrown away. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You don't need something in every color/wash/print/texture/fit. I own 13 pairs of jeans, which is absolutely excessive especially because I usually wear jeans ~1 per week. However, I justified each purchase with a minutely different color, wash, fit, etc. Untill I had far more jeans than necessary. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Focus on getting the right fit. I have too often bought something only to promptly donate it because it was on sale but I knew it was the wrong size or fit. Justifying a purchase when it doesn't fit correctly is wasteful because you simply will not wear it. Be weary of final sale items from companies with unfamiliar fits and don't be afraid to return online purchases that don't fit correctly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Track your spending. A few small purchases rarely resonate but they can really cascade over time. It was very sobering to see the $20k figure come up for me when I looked at my overall clothing spending.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Track your wear patterns. Track how much wear each clothing category gets. This will help you prioritize your purchases. I have tracked my wear for the past year and found that everything I wore in a year could be boiled down to the following: </p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>2 suits</p>\n<p>5-7 work outfits (prioritize items that can be used for personal wear when possible)</p>\n<p>3-4 jackets (rain, lightweight, heavyweight)</p>\n<p>1-2 Sweatshirts + hoodie if desired</p>\n<p>1-2 Sweaters</p>\n<p>1-2 formal OCBD</p>\n<p>2-3 casual print OCBD/flannels</p>\n<p>1-2 long sleeve shirts</p>\n<p>1-2 polos</p>\n<p>1-2 short sleeve BD shirts</p>\n<p>5-7 T shirts with 2 white, 1 gray, 1 black</p>\n<p>2-3 pairs of jeans</p>\n<p>2-3 pairs of chinos</p>\n<p>2-3 pairs of khaki/denim shorts</p>\n<p>1-2 pairs of swim trunks</p>\n<p>2-5 pairs of gym shorts and shirts depending on exercise frequency (if you are into fitness)</p>\n<p>14 Pairs of socks and underwear (more depending on laundry cycle)</p>\n<p>5-7 pairs of shoes (1 gym, 1 canvas, boots)\n3-4 watches (1 beater, 1 dress)</p>\n<p>I am a US North-Midwesterner so obviously each region/country will be slightly different but this could be used as a good guideline for a minimal/frugal wardrobe.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Recognize if you cannot handle following this sub. If it makes you take on debt, feel like you lack self control or takes up too much of your time, just get out. It's not worth it. This sub can become addictive and dangerous if you don't have the money to spend. While I personally have never taken on debt to make fashion purchases, I know people that have and they are still paying for it years later. I have not escaped unscathed though as my fashion spending has hindered my saving potential for the past few years and has set me back from financial goals.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So when browsing FMF, always keep your financial goals top of mind. Thank you for coming to my TED talk, I hope that this helps someone.</p></div>",

Perfect mix of dress pant and chino, which is great for a somewhat elevated business casual outfit. Their washed chinos are also great. I buy both of them in the same size as JCrew 484 chinos, however Bonobos fits a little snugger imo. Bonobos \"tailored\" is between JCrew slim and skinny.</p></div>",

Nothing to write home about, necessarily, unless there are particular items you\u2019ve wanted, that rarely go on sale. </p>\n<p>I work at a university, and they\u2019re currently running an additional, stackable 20% off. So, I got the Waterproof Nordic Hiker boots for $110.88 (pre-tax) after stacking both codes. They\u2019re usually $198.</p>\n<p>You can also stack the 15% off new email sign-ups w/ the original 30% off code if you\u2019re not a student/educator. I found that the 15% off offer didn\u2019t show up on my laptop, but did on my phone. </p>\n<p>https://www.jcrew.com/p/mens/categories/shoes/boots/nordic-waterproof-hiker-boots/AZ842?display=all&amp;fit=Classic&amp;color_name=olive-khaki-multi&amp;colorProductCode=AZ842</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve been eyeing the Waterproof Nordic Hiker boots for a few reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I\u2019m an occasional hiker. I live in a university town in the mountains, and get invited on hikes throughout the year. I wore Cole Haan boots on a hike on the spring, and my Kenton Leather Pacers a few weeks ago. lol. Very ill-prepared. </li>\n<li>I wanted boots with a slimmer profile (since all of my clothes are slim or skinny fit, and I don\u2019t have additional \u201coutdoors activities\u201d clothes) </li>\n<li>I wanted boots that matched the aesthetic of my current wardrobe, but were still actually useful</li>\n<li>I wanted them to be waterproof</li>\n<li>I wanted to pay $115/max for whatever I found. I\u2019m sending back some timberlands I found in that price point that aren\u2019t as slim around the ankles. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>I ordered them in olive/khaki and navy/multi to see which pair I like better. </p>\n<p>Obviously, other deals throughout the site exist, likely on the recently re-added Kenton Leather Pacers, for instance, or newly-released blazers. </p>\n<p>Hope this is helpful to someone else.</p></div>",
