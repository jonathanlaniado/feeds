It was the same salesperson as before and they said they were proud of my shopping abilities!!!</p>\n<p>Great deal for a great swacket and a nice FMF find to end a long work week!!! </p>\n<p>Has anyone else gotten a score like this at a department store?</p><div><br></div><img src=\"https://i.redd.it/zq2lfj7md9gc1.jpeg\" />",

Having been a fan of the Wicked Good moccasins (old pair above), I was excited. That being said, there were some comments on the quality and these being \u201cMade for Zappos\u201d. Here\u2019s my $0.02:</p>\n<p>These are pretty barebones compared to those sold on the LL Bean website. The 3-piece moccasin stitching looks to be done by a machine whereas the originals have a 2-piece construction that can be done by hand (not all of them are like that. Personally, I prefer the look of the original moc construction. The other major change is the outside. I actually really love the original traction outsole, I\u2019ve never slipped in them and they\u2019re just as good as when I bought them ~3 years ago. This Zappos outsole is a step down. Not a whole lot of traction, I can slide a little on my laminate floors. The compound doesn\u2019t seem as durable either. The last change is the stitching style between the outsole and the upper. Looks like a weird welt, but I don\u2019t foresee any problems with it.</p>\n<p>Other than that, I don\u2019t think there are many other changes. The shearling seems to be from the same origin (Australia) as the originals. Can\u2019t tell if the shade difference is from how worn my old pair is. I think they might\u2019ve sanded down the Zappos pair a little bit more however. Personally, I still think $31 is a steal, just temper your expectations a little.</p>",

The key play here is that trade in for the nano puff vest is $40 and the Proton is $54 at REI. I got both but this makes the Nano Puff the clear winner for me as it meant that I could \"renew\" my old vest for $50. Considering how much I used it, it's a great deal. </p>\n<p><strong>For REI sales in general:</strong> Note that you want to look for the items themselves as <strong>REI's sorting algorithm sometimes leave out mark down when sorted by % off.

The SuitSupply portion takes you through the process of speccing out a custom suit and I think it's worth the watch.\n* [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJshLkuOTrw&t=870s)\n\n# Hugo Boss ($500 on sale):\n\nAfter wearing suits from Burlington my entire life, I bought my first nice suit from Nordstrom in 2014. The sales associate pointed me towards Hugo - a trendy, entry level line to the Hugo Boss family. It cost me about $500 and I thought I walked out with a super high quality, name brand suit that would last me ages to come. It wasn't until a few years later when I really looked into the ins and outs of suiting that I realized I had paid for the name on the tag rather than the actual construction of the suit.\n\nI learned that there were three primary types of structured suits: fused, half-canvased, and full canvassed.\n\nThe Boss one I had purchased was a fused suit which meant the inside (typically synthetic) fabric giving it structure and the outer wool was just glued together. This is the most restrictive type of construction because as you move and stretch, the fabric inevitably starts to lift from the glue causing weird bubbles and ripple throughout the jacket. Majority of the suits you see in department stores sub $1000 will be fused since they\u2019re not only easier to produce at scale but much much cheaper.\n\nA fused suit will have a cardboard, boxy like feel that doesn\u2019t drape your body naturally since the fusing is pretty rigid. You\u2019ll notice this especially around the chest and upper back anytime your arms are in motion. The jacket seems to move as a single unit rather than flexing as needed. Heat also becomes an issue as the fusing allows little to no breathability. Details wise, the news does not get much better. You won\u2019t see functional buttons, detail stitching, or a button hole on the lapel. The overly narrow notch lapels prevent it from being a timeless option. While the 100% wool and the fact I had it tailored made it look presentable and wearable, the feel of the wool and the final fit weren\u2019t anything to write home about.\n\nIt\u2019s served well over the years but it\u2019s time to retire this soon as the styling isn\u2019t as timeless with the brighter blue shade and overly narrow lapels. If you slapped a Zara logo on the tag and compared it side by side to one from Zara, I doubt you\u2019d be able to tell a difference based off the construction and styling.\n\n# Suit Supply ($500-$2000):\n\nLet\u2019s move on to Suit Supply. These guys are the go to recommendation for a suit when anyone asks online or on Reddit so I was excited to try my first suit from them. I wanted to go in and try to create a suit as close to my Tom Ford one as I could to see if they could compete so mine came out to $1500. They start at about $500 off the rack and $700 made-to-measure but can go up to around $2000 for a Super150 fabric made to measure three piece suit with all the boxes ticked. The suits across the spectrum are built with the same level of quality and detail the only difference being the fabric, and whether it's half canvassed or fully canvassed.\n\nWith made-to-measure there were three steps: Select your fabric, select your construction/finishings, then get fitted.\n\nI went for a wool/silk blend cream colored fabric (for a summer family wedding), with wide peak lapels, and full canvassing. I opted for a waistcoat and got slightly higher rise pants with the side adjusters to get it as close to the TF one as possible. It was super cool being able to pick out every little aspect of the suit from the inner lining to the buttons to the personalization. I walked through this a bunch more in the video.\n\nWith SuitSupply and especially made-to-measure there, the sales associate you work with will definitely make the biggest difference in the suit. I've had friends and families with bad experiences with the fit because the sales associate didn't know too much about measurements or the types of alterations that are possible once the garment gets in. Thankfully Suit Supply customer service is top notch and they'll take it back for a full refund but definitely try to find the most knowledgable sales associate there. I worked with Aivy at the Houston store and have zero negative things to say. She was super helpful and really knew her stuff!\n\nThe suit itself is made really well, especially for the price point. You get a lot of the details you see with much higher end designers such as the ticket pocket, Milanese button hole, rolling lapel, and the functional button holes. You also have limitless options in terms of colors and fabrics compared to a lot of other suiting brands and they definitely outshine other brands like Indochino and such.\n\nOverall I was really impressed. Suitsupply does a great job at making a suit look a lot more expensive than it is. I really recommend watching this portion of the video as it takes you through the entire process and the small nuggets of info Aivy gives throughout are really helpful.\n\n# TOM FORD:\n\nI bought in 2017 for a close family wedding and I\u2019ve worn it nonstop since then. It is the Windsor cut but we\u2019ll get more into the cuts later.\n\nFrom start to finish, it was an incredible experience. I worked with the same sales associate the entire time making it super easy to text him back and forth for advice and updates. The stock in store is completely different from their stock online and has a lot more options than whats listed on the website. It was my first time buying something of this caliber so the novelty factor probably helped but the service was unmatched. For example, I needed a tie and didn\u2019t want to buy it from TF as they\u2019re quite pricey but the guy helping me bagged it up and walked the suit to a shop across the mall and helped me pick out a tie from a completely different store.\n\nI think the sticker on this was $3800 at the time which was their \u201centry level\u201d option. The only difference in the more expensive models being a higher quality fabric or the addition of a waistcoat. The fabric on the entry level pieces are exceptional so I don\u2019t find the need to splurge in this aspect but a three-piece from Tom Ford is definitely on my fashion bucket list.\n\nIt took a total of 4 fittings to get this tailored perfectly. While other brands I\u2019ve owned give you one fitting and reluctantly agree for a second if you ask for further changes, TF hires some of the best tailors in the game who understand that as you make one large change, smaller changes might come up that need to be tweaked.\n\nThey seek out area that could be better without you having to even tell them and tailor even the most minute details. The cherry on top was the final fitting where everything was perfect except for the rear vent sticking out slightly due to my build. They attached a tiny band of silk connecting one end to the other that fixed the problem right away and looked like it had come that way from the get go. No creases or pulls in sight. Granted, you could also do this to a cheaper suit and an outsourced local tailor but this is the only time I\u2019ve experienced this level of detail for tailoring in a store.\n\nAs I was walking out, suit in hand, the store manager who we got to know really well throughout the process stopped us and handed us a small TF bag and a note that said \u201cCongrats on your first TF suit\u201d. Inside was a 50ml bottle of cologne from their private collection which was an unexpected but super nice touch. Even the customized name plate on the garment bag makes the experience feel special.\n\nStarting with the fabric, all of Tom Ford fabrics are made exclusively for them by Zegna Couture, the highest end of the Zegna range. Even though mine is entry level, its still 100% wool and is made of one of the \"butteriest\" fabrics Ive handled.\n\nThe fit and construction go hand in hand with Tom Ford suits. This is the Windsor or Fit A which is the classic look you think of when you think TF.\n\nAs expected, this is a fully canvased suit but it\u2019s the details that really make it stand out. The 4-5 inch lapels and the addition of the ticket pocket on the right side are the easiest signs when determining if a suit if from TF or not but it\u2019s the subtle details that make the suit. The milanese buttonhole, rolling lapel, the lack of felt under the collar, the barchetta pocket, and the functional button holes all take significantly more time to produce but are tell tell signs of a quality suit with attention paid to the details.\n\nAs cool as these details are, majority of them can be specced with Suit Supply and are not exclusive to TF. You can get a suit from Savile Row or plenty of other brands with the same or better construction and detailing. So what makes a TF suit a TF suit?\n\nIn my opinion it\u2019s how the suit fits and hangs on your body. The traditional TF fit is less a suit you wear but more a suit that wears you in the best way possible. While other suits fit like a glove, I\u2019ve seen this described more so as armor. You almost step into it and it molds you to give you that athletic, broad shoulders, tight waist look even though your body might not be like that underneath.\n\nWhile you might think this fit is exclusive for those with an athletic body type to begin with, the tailors that work at TF might as well be plastic surgeons for how they can make it look like you got a nip and tuck when putting on a tailored TF suit. Sure this fit may not work with every body type but majority do from what I\u2019ve seen with my friends. The high rise pants and the low button set all play into this look.\n\nAs hard as I tried to get the Suit Supply suit to replicate it, I think we fell short in more ways than one. It\u2019s truly a one of a kind suit that just feels different when you slip it on and gives you a level of confidence when wearing it that I haven\u2019t had with any other suiting brand. This suit is insane and it\u2019s honestly one of my favorite things in my closet.\n\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a single thing bad about it except it\u2019s stupid high price point.\n\n# TLDR/Final Thoughts:\n\nIf I was a billionaire, theres no doubt in my mind every suit in my wardrobe would be from TF, however, Suit Supply can take you 90% of the way there at less than half the price.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/xezhkT8](https://imgur.com/a/xezhkT8)<div><br></div><div><p>I have now experienced suits from across the price spectrum so figured a post would be worth my time so you guys can avoid the same mistakes I've made and save some money.</p>\n<h1>Video:</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>All the info is on this post but this is one of my best videos to date. The SuitSupply portion takes you through the process of speccing out a custom suit and I think it's worth the watch.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJshLkuOTrw&amp;t=870s\">Link</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Hugo Boss ($500 on sale):</h1>\n<p>After wearing suits from Burlington my entire life, I bought my first nice suit from Nordstrom in 2014. The sales associate pointed me towards Hugo - a trendy, entry level line to the Hugo Boss family. It cost me about $500 and I thought I walked out with a super high quality, name brand suit that would last me ages to come. It wasn't until a few years later when I really looked into the ins and outs of suiting that I realized I had paid for the name on the tag rather than the actual construction of the suit.</p>\n<p>I learned that there were three primary types of structured suits: fused, half-canvased, and full canvassed.</p>\n<p>The Boss one I had purchased was a fused suit which meant the inside (typically synthetic) fabric giving it structure and the outer wool was just glued together. This is the most restrictive type of construction because as you move and stretch, the fabric inevitably starts to lift from the glue causing weird bubbles and ripple throughout the jacket. Majority of the suits you see in department stores sub $1000 will be fused since they\u2019re not only easier to produce at scale but much much cheaper.</p>\n<p>A fused suit will have a cardboard, boxy like feel that doesn\u2019t drape your body naturally since the fusing is pretty rigid. You\u2019ll notice this especially around the chest and upper back anytime your arms are in motion. The jacket seems to move as a single unit rather than flexing as needed. Heat also becomes an issue as the fusing allows little to no breathability. Details wise, the news does not get much better. You won\u2019t see functional buttons, detail stitching, or a button hole on the lapel. The overly narrow notch lapels prevent it from being a timeless option. While the 100% wool and the fact I had it tailored made it look presentable and wearable, the feel of the wool and the final fit weren\u2019t anything to write home about.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s served well over the years but it\u2019s time to retire this soon as the styling isn\u2019t as timeless with the brighter blue shade and overly narrow lapels. If you slapped a Zara logo on the tag and compared it side by side to one from Zara, I doubt you\u2019d be able to tell a difference based off the construction and styling.</p>\n<h1>Suit Supply ($500-$2000):</h1>\n<p>Let\u2019s move on to Suit Supply. These guys are the go to recommendation for a suit when anyone asks online or on Reddit so I was excited to try my first suit from them. I wanted to go in and try to create a suit as close to my Tom Ford one as I could to see if they could compete so mine came out to $1500. They start at about $500 off the rack and $700 made-to-measure but can go up to around $2000 for a Super150 fabric made to measure three piece suit with all the boxes ticked. The suits across the spectrum are built with the same level of quality and detail the only difference being the fabric, and whether it's half canvassed or fully canvassed.</p>\n<p>With made-to-measure there were three steps: Select your fabric, select your construction/finishings, then get fitted.</p>\n<p>I went for a wool/silk blend cream colored fabric (for a summer family wedding), with wide peak lapels, and full canvassing. I opted for a waistcoat and got slightly higher rise pants with the side adjusters to get it as close to the TF one as possible. It was super cool being able to pick out every little aspect of the suit from the inner lining to the buttons to the personalization. I walked through this a bunch more in the video.</p>\n<p>With SuitSupply and especially made-to-measure there, the sales associate you work with will definitely make the biggest difference in the suit. I've had friends and families with bad experiences with the fit because the sales associate didn't know too much about measurements or the types of alterations that are possible once the garment gets in. Thankfully Suit Supply customer service is top notch and they'll take it back for a full refund but definitely try to find the most knowledgable sales associate there. I worked with Aivy at the Houston store and have zero negative things to say. She was super helpful and really knew her stuff!</p>\n<p>The suit itself is made really well, especially for the price point. You get a lot of the details you see with much higher end designers such as the ticket pocket, Milanese button hole, rolling lapel, and the functional button holes. You also have limitless options in terms of colors and fabrics compared to a lot of other suiting brands and they definitely outshine other brands like Indochino and such.</p>\n<p>Overall I was really impressed. Suitsupply does a great job at making a suit look a lot more expensive than it is. I really recommend watching this portion of the video as it takes you through the entire process and the small nuggets of info Aivy gives throughout are really helpful.</p>\n<h1>TOM FORD:</h1>\n<p>I bought in 2017 for a close family wedding and I\u2019ve worn it nonstop since then. It is the Windsor cut but we\u2019ll get more into the cuts later.</p>\n<p>From start to finish, it was an incredible experience. I worked with the same sales associate the entire time making it super easy to text him back and forth for advice and updates. The stock in store is completely different from their stock online and has a lot more options than whats listed on the website. It was my first time buying something of this caliber so the novelty factor probably helped but the service was unmatched. For example, I needed a tie and didn\u2019t want to buy it from TF as they\u2019re quite pricey but the guy helping me bagged it up and walked the suit to a shop across the mall and helped me pick out a tie from a completely different store.</p>\n<p>I think the sticker on this was $3800 at the time which was their \u201centry level\u201d option. The only difference in the more expensive models being a higher quality fabric or the addition of a waistcoat. The fabric on the entry level pieces are exceptional so I don\u2019t find the need to splurge in this aspect but a three-piece from Tom Ford is definitely on my fashion bucket list.</p>\n<p>It took a total of 4 fittings to get this tailored perfectly. While other brands I\u2019ve owned give you one fitting and reluctantly agree for a second if you ask for further changes, TF hires some of the best tailors in the game who understand that as you make one large change, smaller changes might come up that need to be tweaked.</p>\n<p>They seek out area that could be better without you having to even tell them and tailor even the most minute details. The cherry on top was the final fitting where everything was perfect except for the rear vent sticking out slightly due to my build. They attached a tiny band of silk connecting one end to the other that fixed the problem right away and looked like it had come that way from the get go. No creases or pulls in sight. Granted, you could also do this to a cheaper suit and an outsourced local tailor but this is the only time I\u2019ve experienced this level of detail for tailoring in a store.</p>\n<p>As I was walking out, suit in hand, the store manager who we got to know really well throughout the process stopped us and handed us a small TF bag and a note that said \u201cCongrats on your first TF suit\u201d. Inside was a 50ml bottle of cologne from their private collection which was an unexpected but super nice touch. Even the customized name plate on the garment bag makes the experience feel special.</p>\n<p>Starting with the fabric, all of Tom Ford fabrics are made exclusively for them by Zegna Couture, the highest end of the Zegna range. Even though mine is entry level, its still 100% wool and is made of one of the \"butteriest\" fabrics Ive handled.</p>\n<p>The fit and construction go hand in hand with Tom Ford suits. This is the Windsor or Fit A which is the classic look you think of when you think TF.</p>\n<p>As expected, this is a fully canvased suit but it\u2019s the details that really make it stand out. The 4-5 inch lapels and the addition of the ticket pocket on the right side are the easiest signs when determining if a suit if from TF or not but it\u2019s the subtle details that make the suit. The milanese buttonhole, rolling lapel, the lack of felt under the collar, the barchetta pocket, and the functional button holes all take significantly more time to produce but are tell tell signs of a quality suit with attention paid to the details.</p>\n<p>As cool as these details are, majority of them can be specced with Suit Supply and are not exclusive to TF. You can get a suit from Savile Row or plenty of other brands with the same or better construction and detailing. So what makes a TF suit a TF suit?</p>\n<p>In my opinion it\u2019s how the suit fits and hangs on your body. The traditional TF fit is less a suit you wear but more a suit that wears you in the best way possible. While other suits fit like a glove, I\u2019ve seen this described more so as armor. You almost step into it and it molds you to give you that athletic, broad shoulders, tight waist look even though your body might not be like that underneath.</p>\n<p>While you might think this fit is exclusive for those with an athletic body type to begin with, the tailors that work at TF might as well be plastic surgeons for how they can make it look like you got a nip and tuck when putting on a tailored TF suit. Sure this fit may not work with every body type but majority do from what I\u2019ve seen with my friends. The high rise pants and the low button set all play into this look.</p>\n<p>As hard as I tried to get the Suit Supply suit to replicate it, I think we fell short in more ways than one. It\u2019s truly a one of a kind suit that just feels different when you slip it on and gives you a level of confidence when wearing it that I haven\u2019t had with any other suiting brand. This suit is insane and it\u2019s honestly one of my favorite things in my closet.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a single thing bad about it except it\u2019s stupid high price point.</p>\n<h1>TLDR/Final Thoughts:</h1>\n<p>If I was a billionaire, theres no doubt in my mind every suit in my wardrobe would be from TF, however, Suit Supply can take you 90% of the way there at less than half the price. Granted your results are fully dependent on the sales associate you're working with and the knowledge they have on how to measure/tailor your jackets to give you your optimum look.</p>\n<p>In in the meantime however, I\u2019ll be getting my suits from Suit Supply. It\u2019s a no brainer if you\u2019re in the $500-1000 budget. You\u2019re getting stellar construction, a great selection of fabrics, and great options for customizing at a unbeatable price. Avoid the fused designer stuff like the plague though lol</p>\n<p>If you are really into fashion and wear suits a lot, splurging on Tom Ford for your basic, most worn colors, isn't the worst idea. Your navy and charcoal can be from TF and the remainder you can totally get away with being from Suit Supply.</p>\n<p>A future video I\u2019d like to make is taking a bone stock Suit Supply suit and having a skilled local tailor work their magic.
