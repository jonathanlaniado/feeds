It includes so much stuff, albeit great, that I don't need or ever use.</p>\n<p>Graylog seemed to be way lighter but it didn't seem stable and hassle free. It kept breaking with unattended updates (meaning no f**#&amp; given just docker-compose pull &amp;&amp; up -d --force-recreate), and when it broke I losts all parser etc. had to pull up from zero, create/import groks pipelines etc.. And honestly, Kibana just looks prettier? Oh.. and yeah, stupid little thing, but in Graylog I cannot reorder columns?! In Kibana I can.</p>\n<p>I tried Grafana + Loki + Promtail. They were such a breeze, extremely lightweight and wile they did work, they are admittedly for different purposes. I didn't seem to be able to handle logs as easily as I could with Graylog or Kibana. Like no pretty columns, easy search etc. Although this might've been my lack of experience with Grafana - please do tell me so as this seems a lovely alternative.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>So is there anything else I can do or try to move away from ELK? Can you create a very basic Kibana-like dashboard in Grafana/Loki? Like add the columns, reorder them, etc? Nothing special but I just couldn't make it work? I either had raw logs and search or columns and all pretty (labels as columns transformation) but no search bar :(</p></div>",

Thought You Like It</p>\n<p>Based on a <em>true story</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>xxx: OK, so, our build engineer has left for another company. The dude was literally living inside the terminal. You know, that type of a guy who loves Vim, creates diagrams in Dot and writes wiki-posts in Markdown... If something - anything - requires more than 90 seconds of his time, he writes a script to automate that.  </p>\n<p>xxx: So we're sitting here, looking through his, uhm, \"legacy\"  </p>\n<p>xxx: You're gonna love this  </p>\n<p>xxx: <strong>smack-my-bitch-up.sh</strong> - sends a text message \"late at work\" to his wife (apparently). Automatically picks reasons from an array of strings, randomly. Runs inside a cron-job. The job fires if there are active SSH-sessions on the server after 9pm with his login.  </p>\n<p>xxx: <strong>kumar-asshole.sh</strong> - scans the inbox for emails from \"Kumar\" (a DBA at our clients). Looks for keywords like \"help\", \"trouble\", \"sorry\" etc. If keywords are found - the script SSHes into the clients server and rolls back the staging database to the latest backup. Then sends a reply \"no worries mate, be careful next time\".  </p>\n<p>xxx: <strong>hangover.sh</strong> - another cron-job that is set to specific dates. Sends automated emails like \"not feeling well/gonna work from home\" etc. Adds a random \"reason\" from another predefined array of strings. Fires if there are no interactive sessions on the server at 8:45am.  </p>\n<p>xxx: (and the oscar goes to) <strong>fucking-coffee.sh</strong> - this one waits exactly 17 seconds (!), then opens a telnet session to our coffee-machine (we had no frikin idea the coffee machine is on the network, runs linux and has a TCP socket up and running) and sends something like sys brew. Turns out this thing starts brewing a mid-sized half-caf latte and waits another 24 (!) seconds before pouring it into a cup. The timing is exactly how long it takes to walk to the machine from the dudes desk.  </p>\n<p>xxx: holy sh*t I'm keeping those</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>The Link To This Repo Is <a href=\"https://github.com/NARKOZ/hacker-scripts\">Here</a>.</p>\n<p>You Can ALSO FIND THESE SCRIPTS THERE</p>\n<p>HOPE IT MADE YOU LAUGH.</p></div>",

Your expenses are then consuming the money which is available in the respective Bucket.</p>\n<p>For quite a long time I used <a href=\"https://www.budgetwithbuckets.com\">Buckets App</a> but I was not really happy with historical data visualization and missing bucket versioning.

Everything is  energy efficient, virtualized, and automated, and I only use the cloud and closed-source software where I am absolutely forced to by my employer or because a viable open source alternative does not exist (yet). Sure, updates and full disks provide some welcome opportunities for logging into my servers, but fixing things for me is not the most enjoyable part of the hobby.</p>\n<p>Some evenings, I try to revive the old thrill by fiddling with new services, alternatives to the existing ones and fine-tuning stuff, but the gains are just too marginal to be worth it. I tried to move on to new hobbies, but I have found nothing which comes close to the combination of learning about hardware and software (and their interplay), the feeling of autonomy and control, and the practical use value that is provided by creating my very own digital infrastructure. </p>\n<p>Does anyone know this feeling and have you found a way to deal with it?</p></div>",

It features improved Search (Full-Text/Customizable), Meal Planning, custom Bootstrap theme, improved recipe editing, a new cookbook view, tree structures for Foods/Keywords/Units and much more. </p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/8nmkl63gklx71.png?width=144&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5661a2c37de63bc575032007f07a04906f7469d2</p>\n<p>I cant believe another 8 month have passed again since I <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/lmpolh/tandoor_recipes_big_new_release_of_the_most/\">last</a> brought you the latest and greatest news about Tandoor recipes but I am happy that due to an awesome team of collaborators the release of version 1.0.0 has finally arrived today.</p>\n<p>If you don't feel like reading you can open the <a href=\"https://app.tandoor.dev/accounts/login/?demo\">demo</a>, look at <a href=\"https://github.com/TandoorRecipes/recipes\">GitHub</a> or read the <a href=\"https://docs.tandoor.dev/\">docs</a> on how to get started. There is also a new <a href=\"https://tandoor.dev/\">Website/Hosted Version</a> which aims to bring Tandoor to people not able or willing to Self-Host (currently only available in germany). You can also now chat with me, other contributors and users of tandoor on our new <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RhzBrfWgtp\">discord</a>.</p>\n<p>But lets get into some of the awesome things the past months have brought to tandoor</p>\n<h1>Search</h1>\n<p>Due to the tireless works of one of our greatest contributors, <a href=\"https://github.com/smilerz\">smilerz</a>, the search has been reworked from the ground up allowing a high degree of customization depending on your needs and also much better discoverability due to now searching on full text indices covering not only the recipe title but also description, ingredients, instructions and more.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/eudg4bhrfkx71.png?width=945&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b59acc542678bf688a15b3ccb73762ed0910d92\">Improved Search View and Functions</a></p>\n<p>The search has also gotten a complete UI rework with standardized result cards now being used across the application.</p>\n<h1>Meal Planning</h1>\n<p>Meal Planning, a feature implemented due to Feedback under my <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/eo2z2l/self_hosted_recipe_management_tool/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">first post</a> here, has seen an complete rewrite since the last post improving on UI/UX while also offering a more stable foundation for future improvements.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/zlpoe0znrkx71.png?width=1368&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=195c92a169af618e4ae8dd3603d11c58bb6f7df2\">New Meal Planner UI</a></p>\n<p>While the current version offers just the features the last one did with improved usability and design it is planned to add features like automatic planning, nutrition based views, CalDav Based bi-directional calendar syncing and much more.</p>\n<h1>Other Features</h1>\n<p>Foods, Keywords and Units can now be organized in a <strong>tree like data structure</strong> allowing for more fine grained control over hierarchy and search options. Along with this also came a <strong>new standardized list view</strong> which allows for <strong>moving, merging</strong>, editing and deleting of various database objects in a fully responsive and <strong>modern new Vue.js</strong> frontend.</p>\n<p>The <strong>navigation</strong> has long outgrown the features so version 0.17.0 completely overhauled its structure to reflect on the most prominent and often used features in the newer versions of tandoor. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/fo0unmgtukx71.png?width=1368&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a21cb3d2f103fa4947e6b43a62cceea364d1893\">New Recipe Books Page</a></p>\n<p>To combine the benefits of good old analog cookbooks with the modern digital data tandoor provides we have reworked the <strong>cookbook view</strong> to offer a more detailed but still quick look into the recipes collected inside a book. It is now also possible to filter for books on the search page.</p>\n<p>To allow you to host tandoor not only for yourself and your next ones you can now also have <strong>multiple tennants</strong> (so called spaces) in your application and thus bring self hosted, privacy first recipe management to your friends and extended family. This works similarly to Nextclouds user accounts but with more focus on having multiple people collaborate on each space.</p>\n<p>This of course are not all the things we have been up to in the last months, if you want to know everything feel free to take a look at the <a href=\"https://github.com/TandoorRecipes/recipes/releases\">changelog</a>.</p>\n<h1>Roadmap</h1>\n<p>While many features have already been implemented there are hundreds of ideas still waiting for implementation and more are added every day by our great community. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>A complete overhaul of how nutrition tracking is done and how it integrates into different features like meal planning, logging, and shopping is planned to help people pay more attention to what they eat (<a href=\"https://github.com/TandoorRecipes/recipes/issues/896\">GitHub Issue</a>).</li>\n<li><strong>Automations</strong> are already implemented in a very early beta stage to remove repetitive tasks and keep your instance clean allowing you to for example automatically rename foods on import. Once a certain technical maturity is reached this should be expanded to many more parts of the application (<a href=\"https://github.com/TandoorRecipes/recipes/issues/167\">GitHub Issue</a>)</li>\n<li>While improving on the features for internal recipes <strong>files and external recipes</strong> will get their round of attention improving the UI/UX and likely adding new features like (automatic) OCR, split views and more. </li>\n<li><strong>Shopping</strong> lists are already working quite well but over the time we have noticed some limitations of the current technical approach. This is why we are currently working on completely refactoring the shopping system (<a href=\"https://github.com/TandoorRecipes/recipes/issues/893\">GitHub Issue</a>).</li>\n<li>While the system of having steps of different types for recipes has worked well in the past recent additions like sub recipes, files and more have shown its limitations. We plan on making steps more dynamic and showing better UIs depending on which data is actually added to a step.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Feel free to add you own ideas to the agenda by raising an issue on GitHub or reading trough all the <a href=\"https://github.com/TandoorRecipes/recipes/issues\">ideas</a> others have filed over time.</p>\n<p>Many thanks to all the people who have made this possible, I am looking forward to what the next years bring. I would be happy to hear your feedback and maybe even why or how you have been using tandoor.</p></div>",

With minimal setup, Dim will scan your media collections and allow you to remotely play them from anywhere. We are currently still in the MVP stage, but we hope that over-time, with feedback from the community, we can offer a competitive drop-in replacement for Plex, Emby and Jellyfin. </p>\n<p>Features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>CPU Transcoding</li>\n<li>Hardware accelerated transcoding (with some runtime feature detection)</li>\n<li>Transmuxing</li>\n<li>Subtitle streaming</li>\n<li>Support for common movie, tv show and anime naming schemes</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Why another media manager?</strong></p>\n<p>We feel like Plex is starting to abandon the idea of home media servers, not to mention that the centralization makes using plex a pain (their auth servers are a bit.......unstable....). Jellyfin is a worthy alternative but unfortunately it is quite unstable and doesn't perform well on large collections. We want to build a modern media manager which offers the same UX and user friendliness as Plex minus all the centralization that comes with it.</p></div>",

That was encouraging, so I got coding, and here I am a few months later with an MVP launch of the product: <a href=\"https://github.com/nitnelave/lldap\">https://github.com/nitnelave/lldap</a></p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>It's a simple user management webapp (SPA) with users and groups, that comes with a basic read-only LDAP server. That means you can plug in your Jellyfin, your Nextcloud, your Authelia or even your Keycloak and they will use this as the source of truth for your users!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/v0cs0qxd8du71.png?width=1320&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4612e976f29210ed88cba7cf4ad8cea859803c54\">Screenshot of the user management page</a></p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Note that this is a Minimum Viable Product, and as such it implements only the very basic features. The roadmap can be found here: <a href=\"https://github.com/nitnelave/lldap/projects/2\">https://github.com/nitnelave/lldap/projects/2</a>, starting with allowing a password change through LDAP to reset the passwords via Authelia/Keycloak/other and allowing a password reset through email (currently only the admin can change your password if you forgot it).</p>\n<p>If you find any bugs, feel free to <a href=\"https://github.com/nitnelave/lldap/issues\">create an issue</a> on GitHub.</p>\n<p>You can install it via <a href=\"https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/nitnelave/lldap\">docker</a> (easiest) or run it directly from source, the instructions are in the README.</p>\n<p>Feel free to join us on <a href=\"https://discord.gg/h5PEdRMNyP\">Discord</a>, and follow me on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nitnelave1\">Twitter</a> for updates on the project!</p>\n<p>For those who already tried the server before the MVP release: &gt;!The password hashing scheme was slightly changed to speed up logging in, which has the unfortunate consequence that all passwords are now invalid, including the admin one. Either delete the DB (`rm users.db` or using SQlite, delete the admin user `DELETE FROM users WHERE id = \"admin\";`).!&lt;</p></div>",

Below are the major ones, please read on.  </p>\n<p><strong>Updated documentation and tutorials</strong><br />\nI welcome you to our documentation part of the repo where you can find self-hosting, quick start guides, and a couple of explanatory videos. (Documentation is still a work in progress).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/wiretrustee/wiretrustee/blob/main/docs/README.md\">https://github.com/wiretrustee/wiretrustee/blob/main/docs/README.md</a></p>\n<p><strong>Multiplatform support</strong></p>\n<p>Wiretrustee works on Linux, macOS, and Windows. It also runs on arm devices like RaspberryPi.<br />\nOn Linux, Wiretrustee will use the kernel Wireguard module if available.</p>\n<p>Mobile apps are planned for the future. </p>\n<p><strong>Wiretrustee got a Management Service</strong></p>\n<p>A service that stores network metadata and distributes network changes to peers. </p>\n<p>So, the part when you had to manually configure peers (add-peer command) and remember IPs is now automatic. Whenever a new peer joins the network all other peers will receive an update and connect to it!  </p>\n<p>Additionally, Management Service supports SSL with an automatic Let's Encrypt certificate generation or a custom certificate from a file.</p>\n<p><strong>Wiretrustee got a Management UI Dashboard</strong></p>\n<p>A couple of screenshots first :)  </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/kjqnzr2ifzp71.png?width=667&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=598f0cb0a4dc6ac3c16ff74b9a2199c9fa35ad94\">Login screen</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/yjx818uvezp71.png?width=1316&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=270f899d96a6c9887522477c3f4a5764fbcedc43\">Peers list screen </a></p>\n<p>The dashboard displays a list of peers, setup keys, and helps to manage your network. It also features a social login and auto Let's Encrypt certificate. </p>\n<p>User management is the only part that can't be self-hosted. We decided to use the Auth0 service to \"outsource\" the user management part due to the fact that usually, it takes quite an effort to make it right and secure.</p>\n<p>The dashboard is an open-source single-page app written in React JS<br />\n<a href=\"https://github.com/wiretrustee/wiretrustee-dashboard\">https://github.com/wiretrustee/wiretrustee-dashboard</a></p>\n<p><strong>An upgraded relaying</strong></p>\n<p>Wiretrustee uses <a href=\"https://github.com/coturn/coturn\">TURN</a> to relay traffic in case a direct peer-to-peer connection isn't possible (happens with carrier-grade NATs). </p>\n<p>We've added a feature to secure access to the TURN relay with secret-based time-limited credentials. The Management Service periodically generates a token that can be used by peers to access TURN. Old tokens are expiring after TTL.  </p>\n<p><strong>P.S.</strong> <br />\nI hope you read it till the end :) Let me know what you think!</p></div>",

Any feedback is welcome!</code></p>\n<p><strong>Important</strong>: This guide is aimed at <em>beginners</em>, so I won't go too much in-depth and mostly rely on common sense and (fairly) easy to implement solutions. I will make a more advanced guide later on.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<h1>First: What's going on?</h1>\n<p>Recently posts have been showing up about people finding others' exposed dashboards or even fully unprotected services such as Heimdall, Pihole, Calibre, you name it. People expose it all on the public web, often without even knowing they're doing so.</p>\n<p>To some this might seem innocent, but it's not. Even if you're not a specific target to anyone, there a lots of automated bots and botnets out there who just scan the entire internet for exposed services like yours in order to exploit those.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><strong>So what are the dangers of this exactly?</strong></p>\n<p>Those services you're hosting are exposing a lot of your private info. I'll list a few examples of things I come across.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I once came across a fully open Calibre instance, upon browsing through it I found out that this particular person configured Calibres mail settings using their GMail details, just a little tinkering exposed their full GMail username and password</li>\n<li>People tend to use their full names, or even full address info, etc. in things like Nextcloud, maybe even things like Pihole or Heimdall. This <em>will</em> make you a target for (automated) phishing campaigns. If those services are publicly accessible you can easily assume that someone has already got his hands on your info.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So this all might seem innocuous to some, or some might even utter the: But I have nothing to hide - kind of phrase. But think about why most people are self-hosting in the first place. Privacy is most likely a big part of that, and now you're putting that out on the web for everyone to see?</p>\n<p>In example: Big data, botnets, hackers, etc.  can build an extensive profile based on this kind of info:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>One could sift through your Calibre service to find out what things you read.</li>\n<li>One could sift through your Pihole logs to find out what you do on the web.</li>\n<li>One could search through your Plex, Jellyfin, or others to find out what things you like to watch.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This kind of info is especially useful for things like Phishing campaigns. The more familiar and polished a phishing mail is, the more likely you'll fall for it. And you <em>will</em> be targeted. No-one's exempt.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Another danger is the case where people have a set-and-forget mentality, which leads them to never updating their services. In that case your service <strong>will</strong> get hacked at some point which might result in anything from your device being abused as cryptominer, to your connection being abused for malicious traffic, your devices being enslaved into a botnet or an actual human hacker who might have even more sinister intents.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<h1>How do I know if I'm publicly exposing services?</h1>\n<p>There are a few indicators which will easily tell you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Did you ever follow a guide that told you to port-forward something?</li>\n<li>Do you proxy or forward your services using a reverse proxy? (i.e. Nginx proxy manager)</li>\n<li>Can you access your services from anywhere (i.e. from your phone) without any extra effort like a VPN.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><strong>I'm not sure, how do I check?</strong></p>\n<p>There are plenty of tools that will freely tell you if you're hosting something. First you'll need to know your public IP. Some site like <a href=\"https://whatismyipaddress.com/\">https://whatismyipaddress.com/</a> will tell you.</p>\n<p>Please realise you might have a number of different IP addresses dependent on if your provider provides you with both IPv4 and/or IPv6. Your <em>public</em> IPv4 address will be the same for all devices in your network, but your IPv6 address will be different <em>per device!</em></p>\n<p>The following tools might give you an insight in the ports you have opened publicly:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Shodan</strong> <a href=\"https://shodan.io\">https://shodan.io</a> - Shodan does it's own scanning but will not per-say reveal everything as it does not tend to scan every single open port at any given time. Some IP addresses might not even be listed in Shodan.</li>\n<li><strong>Yougetsignal</strong> <a href=\"https://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/open-ports/\">https://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/open-ports/</a>  - Chances are that if you've been port forwarding you've been using a tool like this to actually verify if the port you've configured is accessible.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><strong>I'm still unsure and I want to scan it all, how do I do that?</strong></p>\n<p>This section is slightly more advanced, but if you can selfhost then you can do this too!</p>\n<p>First you'll need a device that does <em>not</em> host any of your services and a <strong>different internet connection</strong>. (Your phone's 4G or a neighbours WiFi will do).</p>\n<p>You'll need a port scanning tool, in this case I'll use nmap which is available for practically all linux distributions, macOS and Windows.</p>\n<p>If you're using Windows you can download nmap here: <a href=\"https://nmap.org/download.html\">https://nmap.org/download.html</a></p>\n<p>If you're using a Debian based distro (Debian, Ubuntu, Mint, etc.)  you can install nmap using <code>sudo apt install nmap</code></p>\n<p>If you're using a Redhat based distro (Redhat, Fedora, CentOS, etc.) you can install nmap using <code>sudo</code> <code>dnf install nmap</code></p>\n<p>If you're using macOS you can install nmap using Homebrew ( <a href=\"https://brew.sh\">https://brew.sh</a> ) by issuing <code>brew install nmap</code></p>\n<p>One you've got nmap setup, make sure you're using a different internet connection and then issue:</p>\n<pre><code>nmap -v -T4 -sV -A -p 1-65535 my.public.ip.address\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will take a while as it'll scan all available TCP ports. It'll also try to determine what's running on an open port it finds (-sV flag) as well as some additional detection (-A flag)</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<h1>Okay, so I do got open ports, what do I do?</h1>\n<p>Firstly, you'll have to close them. It's most likely that you'll do this in your router. If you're unsure then I'd suggest you check the guide that you used to setup your service in order to determine what steps you took to expose it to the internet in the first place.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><strong>So now my ports are closed, but I can't access service</strong> <strong><em>xyz</em></strong> <strong>from remote anymore. What do I do?</strong></p>\n<p>It's understandable you want to access your services from anywhere, but there are more secure methods for this then simply exposing this.</p>\n<p>There are a number of steps you can take which'll be listed in order from most secure to least.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use a VPN</li>\n<li>Setting up a VPN like <a href=\"https://www.wireguard.com/\">Wireguard</a> is easy and secure. WireGuard has support for all major devices and it'll allow you to access your entire network from anywhere.</li>\n<li><em>Sidenote: You'll have to port forward WireGuard from your router, this is to be expected. But exposing a VPN service to the public internet is way more secure then exposing an unsecured service.</em></li>\n<li>Use port-forwarding with specific IPs</li>\n<li>This is a feature some routers might not support. But you can utilize a whitelist of IPs that can access your service.</li>\n<li>Using Cloudflare's<a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/argo-tunnel/\">Argo tunnel</a></li>\n<li>By using Cloudflare's Argo tunnel you don't have to open any ports, but instead your webserver will build up a vpn-like connection to cloudflare, over which your webserver will be reachable to cloudflare. Your users then access your service through cloudflare without any risk for you due to exposed ports.</li>\n<li>Utilizing a security CDN like CloudFlare</li>\n<li>Using services like CloudFlare prevents an attacker from learning your actual IP address (unless said IP address can be accessed somehow through your service of course). Additionally CloudFlare actively filters out bots and malicious traffic. Depending on your tier with them you have more granular control and can choose to block entire countries from accessing your site.</li>\n<li>Use a reverse proxy with an authentication frontend</li>\n<li>One could utilize a platform like <a href=\"https://www.authelia.com/\">Authelia</a> or <a href=\"https://www.keycloak.org/\">Keycloak</a> to secure public-facing services.</li>\n<li>Use a reverse proxy and utilize access-lists</li>\n<li>A thing one could do with a reverse proxy like nginx is the usage of access lists.
