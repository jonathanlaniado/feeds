It\u2019s been several weeks since our last post, and we\u2019ve been working steadily to improve both the core platform and the overall experience. This brings us closer to a feature complete self-hosted alternative to Cloudflare tunnels but we still have a lot of work to do!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/fosrl/pangolin\">https://github.com/fosrl/pangolin</a></li>\n<li>Docs: <a href=\"https://docs.fossorial.io/\">https://docs.fossorial.io/</a></li>\n<li>Discord: <a href=\"https://discord.gg/HCJR8Xhme4\">https://discord.gg/HCJR8Xhme4</a></li>\n<li>Join the subreddit: r/PangolinReverseProxy (thank you to u/GoofyGills for setting this up)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>External Identity Providers</strong></p>\n<p>We\u2019re excited to share that Pangolin now supports external identity providers. You can integrate any identity provider that supports OAuth2/OIDC. We plan to expand with native support for other platforms over time, as well as continue to bolster and add new authentication and access control tooling. See more in our <a href=\"https://docs.fossorial.io/Pangolin/Identity%20Providers/configuring-identity-providers\">docs</a></p>\n<p>Our focus is to make it easier to plug Pangolin into whatever ecosystem you\u2019re already using.</p>\n<p><strong>UI Refresh</strong></p>\n<p>Alongside that, we\u2019ve also launched a refreshed UI. This new layout is more maintainable, expandable, and aligned with the long-term direction of the project. Importantly, it still maintains a largely consistent user experience. We will continue shipping enhancements on top of this foundation. See screenshots and more on <a href=\"https://github.com/fosrl/pangolin\">GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ywtz6n121eye1.png?width=2552&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa7009a0929d4cfe234aab3ae0bf3071fdd91d0a\">Collage of screenshots showing UI refresh.</a></p>\n<p><strong>More Features</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Full integration REST API with fine-grained access API keys</li>\n<li>Optionally set sticky sessions for load balancing</li>\n<li>Add a place to see and cancel open user invitations</li>\n<li>Optionally set TLS server name for use with SNI</li>\n<li>Optionally set custom host header</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thank you to those of you who opened a PR this cycle.</p>\n<p><strong>Other Updates</strong></p>\n<p>Since our last update, Pangolin has continued to grow quickly. We crossed 5.2K stars at the 90-day mark, and just a few weeks later we\u2019re at 7,000 GitHub stars. To everyone who has starred, shared, or contributed in any way \u2014 thank you. And a special thank you to those who have supported the project financially through the Supporter Program.</p>\n<p>We also want to share that we\u2019ve introduced a new Professional Edition license. This is primarily aimed at businesses using Pangolin in production or commercial environments and provides access to some extra features and primarily dedicated support from us. This change helps us more predictably fund continued development and long-term maintenance of the project. Read more about this on our <a href=\"https://docs.fossorial.io/professional-edition\">docs</a>.</p>",

Since the legal process is still unresolved, I\u2019ll have to save the full story for another time. For now, I\u2019ve decided that the best path forward is to rebrand.</p>\n<p>Starting today, Hoarder is rebranding to Karakeep! </p>\n<p>The name Karakeep is inspired by the Arabic word \"\u0643\u0631\u0627\u0643\u064a\u0628\" (karakeeb), a colloquial term commonly used to refer to miscellaneous clutter, odds and ends, or items that may seem disorganized but often hold personal value or hidden usefulness. It evokes the image of a messy drawer or forgotten box, full of stuff you can't quite throw away\u2014because somehow, it matters (or more likely, because you're a hoarder!).</p>\n<p>Over the next couple of weeks, things will start getting renamed to Karakeep (the repo, apps, extensions, etc). <a href=\"https://hoarder.app\">hoarder.app</a> will soon also begin redirecting to our new domain: <a href=\"https://karakeep.app\">karakeep.app</a>.</p>\n<p>I took pride in coming up with \"hoarder\" as the name for the project. I've spent months searching for a different name, but nothing felt as good as hoarder was. But it's time to move on. I'm incredibly grateful for the support this community has shown throughout the whole thing. Hopefully, I can now focus my time and energy on what matters: building Karakeep.</p>\n<p>It goes without saying, but please refrain from contacting the other party in any way, shape, or form.</p>",

Even managed to transfer 50TB of media with no losses. I have big plans for the future, and wouldn\u2019t be able to do any of it without this sub and the help you all have offered.

Fourteen Docker containers just to manage a suite of 'internet of things connected shitware. You celebrate each others descent into madness with vomit inducing comments like \"Nice setup! Have you considered adding Prometheus monitoring?\" You are all a bunch of sick freaks, you make me ill.</p>\n<p>And the money you guys must spaff away... you've somehow convinced yourself that spending thousands on enterprise server equipment from 2012 is justified as it was originally 10x the cost. And then you refer to it as \u201cyour little setup\". \"Oh this? Just my Dual mirrored RAID 10 arrays with triple redundant UPS and backup diesel generator that kicks in if the power flickrs for more than 3 milliseconds. You know, for my Linux ISO collection\" Meanwhile your electricity meter spins so fast it could probably generate its own electricity. You are all a bunch of sick freaks, and you need help.</p>\n<p>I take solace in imagining what your home lives are like, I laugh as I imagine your families, having to sit through dinner listening to you explain why running Pi-hole with Unbound is superior to forwarding to Cloudflare. I bet your kids start crying when you mention DNS-over-HTTPS. Your wife just stares at you now, especially since you've replaced all your family photos with Grafana dashboards.</p>\n<p>I imagine you boiling over when when the women you made vows to asks \"why can\u2019t we just go back to using iCloud\" when your precious self-hosted photo library goes down during your third Photoprism upgrade this week. They completely ignore your \u2018impressive\u2019 (97% lol) uptime statistics and offsite backups. You are all a bunch of sick freaks, and your loved ones are losing hope.</p>\n<p>No, you don't need Kubernetes or 10gig network switches or 7u rack. You don't need any of these increasingly abstract layers of complexity that exist only to solve the problems created by your previous solutions. Your simple file server didn't need containers, those containers didn't need orchestration, that orchestration didn't need a service mesh, Yet here you are, staring at 10,000 lines of YAML, wondering if maybe just one more helm chart would finally make it all perfect. But I know you'll keep adding more, because you're all just a bunch of sick freaks.</p>",

I use OpenLiteSpeed to serve the actual website itself. </p>\n<p>The site communicates to a backend flask server that runs locally on the machine and processes all the necessary information the site needs to function, including the notification features.

This allows me to route my domain to the local ip of my server without ever port forwarding or revealing my local network in any meaningful way. </p>\n<p>OpenLiteSpeed actually functions as a reverse proxy, I host my portfolio off of the same server and OpenLiteSpeed routes traffic based off of the domain. </p>\n<p>I wouldn\u2019t recommend this unless you really enjoy tinkering with this stuff because it can be a pain and it\u2019s probably cheaper to use a reputable hosting service, especially when counting setup and maintenance hours. </p>\n<p>I\u2019ll answer any questions you all have! </p>\n<p>The two sites mentioned:\nhttps://potustracker.us\nhttps://lukewin.es (my portfolio) </p><div><br></div><img src=\"https://i.redd.it/j4l5fxu65afe1.jpeg\" />",

When you're managing hundreds of sets and pieces occasionally go missing (as they do!), it becomes really challenging to keep track of everything with existing tools.</p>\n<h1>What can it do?</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Track multiple copies of the same set</strong> - Each set gets a unique ID, so you can track different missing pieces across duplicate sets</li>\n<li><strong>Manage missing pieces</strong> - Keep track of what's missing across your entire collection</li>\n<li><strong>View your complete inventory</strong> - See all parts and minifigures across your sets</li>\n<li><strong>Smart image handling</strong> - Images are downloaded once and stored locally, so you're not constantly hitting Rebrickable's API</li>\n<li><strong>Instructions management</strong> - Add PDF instructions for easy access</li>\n<li><strong>Wishlist support</strong> - Keep track of sets you want to add to your collection</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Screenshots</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://xbackbone.baerentsen.space/LaMU8/koLAhiWe94.png/raw\">Main interface with set overview</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://xbackbone.baerentsen.space/LaMU8/MeXaYuVI44.png/raw\">Parts inventory</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://xbackbone.baerentsen.space/LaMU8/YEPEKOsE50.png/raw\">Missing pieces tracker</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://xbackbone.baerentsen.space/LaMU8/RuWoduFU08.png/raw\">Minifigure collection</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://xbackbone.baerentsen.space/LaMU8/hACAbArO44.png/raw\">Wishlist</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Tech</h1>\n<p>It's built with Python3, Flask and SQLite, runs in Docker, and only requires a Rebrickable API key to get started. All the code is available on my <a href=\"https://gitea.baerentsen.space/FrederikBaerentsen/BrickTracker\">Gitea</a> instance, and setup is pretty straightforward with Docker Compose.</p>\n<h1>Note</h1>\n<p>This has been a hobby project that's grown over time, so don't expect enterprise-grade code! It's built to solve real problems I've had managing my LEGO collection, and I figured others might find it useful too.</p>\n<h1>Try it out!</h1>\n<p>You can find the project here: https://gitea.baerentsen.space/FrederikBaerentsen/BrickTracker\nIf you have any questions or run into issues, feel free to ask. I'd love to hear your feedback and suggestions!</p>\n<p>Once set up, it runs locally and only calls Rebrickable when adding new sets.</p>",

Its my third post here and I am so happy to tell that I have got like 5000 active users in the last 2 months, with 1000 repeating users. Let me start from starting, I built <a href=\"https://www.mldl.study/\">https://www.mldl.study/</a> back 2-3 months back. It provides proper roadmap for someone to go into field of AI. It has proper roadmap from ml prerequisite like maths and python to ml roadmap, dl roadmap, and even now genAI roadmap. I opensourced the site around 1 month ago and got great responses from everyone here. I was so happy that after my endsems got complete, I started working more on it. Now with the current update I have added genAI roadmap too and also a research paper section where there is all major research papers that you should read.</p>\n<p>The site has everything from video lectures, articles, visualizations, simulations, research papers, project work, competitions etc. Its a great site for anyone who really want to learn AI.</p>\n<p>Now even though i open sourced it back 1 month ago, I still did not got contributions that I had thought I would. I really really want you guys to contribute to the resources and help the community. I just want your support everyone , and I appreciate everyone who supported me in my last 2 posts and motivated me to work more on it.</p>\n<p>genAI roadmap is not completed and i really want you guys to contribute to the resources there. here is the link to the repo <a href=\"https://github.com/anshaneja5/mldl.study\">https://github.com/anshaneja5/mldl.study</a> . I would love if you guys want to give any suggestions too ;)</p>\n<p>I appreciate your time and patience, thanks guys ;)</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/4emr1i1tfm8e1.png?width=1558&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d2e4bc1972c32fb7d1d193b51933f791d1364696</p>",

I still remember the project\u2019s early days and loved seeing those first issues open on GitHub. How exciting it has been to build something useful for so many people. I am grateful for the compassionate community as well as the feedback and criticism we have received this year.</p>\n<p>The project's core idea is to do good things without a hidden agenda or ill motives, to give people a delightful choice to manage their digital media besides the solutions from exploitative big cloud providers. Just last year, we were daydreaming of how wonderful it would be if we could do those things daily as our full-time job. One might have said it is good karma, but Louis Rossman from FUTO found us and extended the invitation for the company to fund the project to let us develop the software full-time. It was a dream come true for all the core contributors to talk about Immich, interact with the users, have fun writing code, and build out the features of Immich every day. We would not be here without your love and support for the project.</p>\n<p>Similar to <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/18gz26i/immich_recap_for_2023_with_accomplished/\">last year</a>, here\u2019s a recap of everything the project accomplished in 2024:</p>\n<h1>Milestones</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>A new logo from the community contest</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/q2iy1s1h918e1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a6c5c9a36fd4bdb1ad6e9764334c24b6c4d37c6\">Y'all remember the Oda clan logo? :P</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>GPU acceleration for machine learning</li>\n<li>Library watching</li>\n<li>Search enhancement with advanced filtering</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/lda67eoi818e1.png?width=1944&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=600d46815eb1cc09c6afc3efc6eaff31c237e559\">Search enhancement</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Built-in OpenTelemetry metrics</li>\n<li>Read-only albums</li>\n<li>Email notifications</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/nqmrl66p818e1.png?width=1842&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c50dbd670fa337f53492b223f3ea58d04ef201a\">Email notification settings</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Microservices container be gone</li>\n<li>Web translation</li>\n<li>Immich-hosted map tiles</li>\n<li>Star rating</li>\n<li><strong>Basic editing on mobile</strong></li>\n<li>Theming on mobile</li>\n<li>Folder view</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/phrmaoku818e1.png?width=1623&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f7cae2bf3de5c7b03907806d57625b135874b9b\">Folder browser</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tag support</li>\n<li>Album sync on mobile</li>\n<li>Automatic database backup</li>\n<li>Auto-switching server URL in the mobile app</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/r444s107918e1.png?width=462&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6abafbebe0b096c5f428b006676155aec349b40c\">Automatic server URL switching</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Alternative machine learning URL switching</li>\n<li>Supporter Badge / <a href=\"http://buy.immich.app\">buy.immich.app</a></li>\n<li>and more</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Fun</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Over 30k stars were added to Immich\u2019s sky on GitHub <strong>\u2b50</strong> <em>[editor's note: Jan 16, 23940]</em></li>\n<li>Going from MIT to AGPLv3 License</li>\n<li>Over 900 awesome people from the community helped make Immich a better software.</li>\n<li>Overcame our first marketing fallout with the choice of wording in the product key purchase introduction</li>\n<li>Immich isn\u2019t even 3 years old yet.

It also has VirtualBox with two (for now VMs).</p>\n<p>The first VM is an OpenBSD load balancer, which is the one that is connected to the outside world. Relayd does the reverse proxying with SNI, and the SSL certificates are provided by letsencrypt.</p>\n<p>The second VM is an Ubuntu Server machine, with a full LAMP attack for the various websites I have.</p>\n<p>The box on the right is a NAS, keeping backups of my source code, backups of the VM, and the daily builds of my game. </p>\n<p>Moving forward I'll only be using AWS for domain registration and DNS, but I may even move that somewhere else. </p>\n<p>What do you think of my setup?</p><div><br></div><img src=\"https://i.redd.it/hifni8ea2o0e1.jpeg\" />",

I've been a  self-hosting enthusiast for well over a decade now, from old game-servers for my friends and I in the mid-2000's on a centOS box in my garage to now having a full-fledged homelab serving content of all types.  I am incredibly excited to have created something that could presumably be used by others who might enjoy it in the same way that I have enjoyed these types of services for the greater part of my life!</p>\n<p>This project is called <strong>Retrom</strong>, and is most simply described as an emulation library frontend. However, the thing that sets Retrom apart is it's first-class support for centralized, self-hosted game libraries. I am aware that this is a bit of a niche that Retrom is targeting, but I am sure there are plenty of users here that have large libraries of retro games sitting on their NAS that could possibly see some use from this. I mean, how small could the intersection of retro game collectors, emulation enthusiasts, data archivists and home-lab enthusiasts be, really??</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Download links, docs and source code can all be found at the</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/jmberesford/retrom\"><strong>github repository</strong></a><strong>, for those interested</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Retrom is still in the early stages of development, but I'm excited to share it with you all and get feedback. I'm certain there are bugs to be found, and I would not describe Retrom as <em>fully-featured</em> yet, but I'm excited to see what others think and would like to use the feedback to guide future development.</p>\n<h1>Here is a list of Retrom's main features:</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Self Hosted Game Libraries</strong>: Retrom is designed with self-hosted game libraries in mind. This means that you can host your own game library on your own server, and Retrom will be able to access it. Simply spin up the Retrom service in a docker container (binary distribution coming soon), and point it to your game library.</li>\n<li><strong>Game Metadata and Covers</strong>: Retrom will automatically download metadata and covers for your games, and display them in a beautiful and easy to use UI. Metadata and images are automatically sourced from supported providers, and can be manually edited if needed.</li>\n<li><strong>Desktop and Web Clients</strong>: Connect any amount of clients to your Retrom service, and they will all be able to manage, install and play your games. Large libraries need not take up space on your local machine, and you can access your games from anywhere.</li>\n<li><strong>Multi-platform</strong>: Retrom's desktop client is available for use on Windows, MacOS, and Linux. The web client is accessible on any device with a modern web browser, and can be easily deployed via docker alongside the service.</li>\n<li><strong>First Class Emulation Support</strong>: Retrom has first-class support for emulation, and is designed with flexibility in mind. You can configure the Retrom client to launch games with any emulator you have installed on your machine, and further configure launch profiles for each emulator (e.g. launch in fullscreen/launch in windowed profiles).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>The next major milestones on the roadmap for Retrom are as follows:</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>User Authentication and Permissions</strong>: Retrom will soon support user authentication and permissions. This means that you can create user accounts for your friends and family, and give them access to your game library.</li>\n<li><strong>Standalone Mode</strong>: Retrom will soon support a standalone mode, where the service and client are bundled together in a single binary. This will make it easier to get started with Retrom, and will be especially useful for users who don't want to host their own game library.</li>\n<li><strong>Fullscreen UI and Gamepad Support</strong>: The desktop client will soon have a fullscreen UI mode, and will support gamepad input. This will make Retrom a great choice for use on a TV or other large screen.</li>\n<li><strong>Cloud Save Support</strong>: Retrom will soon support cloud saves for your games. This means that you can save your game progress to your retrom service, and pick up where you left off on any device.</li>\n<li><strong>Built-in Emulator Profiles</strong>: Retrom will soon ship with built-in emulator profiles for popular emulators. This will make it easier to get started with emulation, and will make it easier to configure your emulators for use with Retrom.</li>\n<li><strong>Additional Metadata Providers</strong>: Retrom will soon support additional metadata providers. Currently, Retrom uses IGDB for metadata and cover images, but additional providers like SteamGridDB will be added in the future.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Screenshots</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/32m27g1yf2pd1.jpg?width=1843&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=73aba91ae2fe3f3712ddffdb1ba05e645ef9accb\">Home screen</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/rbg5ch1yf2pd1.jpg?width=1623&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=551b8ff9181b9cd2c7173b132cec79da5cb67e6d\">Game view</a></p>",

With TailScale, TailScale itself exposes ports. You authenticate and connect to those ports, which then connect you back to the reverse connection from your home. Ports are exposed at TailScale. TailScale gets access to your home network. You would have a lower attack surface if you just opened a VPN port in your home. If your security requirements and threat model allow for using TailScale then it's totally fine to use it, but the idea that TailScale doesn't expose ports is a half-truth.</p>\n<p>2: If you use a reverse proxy the way OP does, attackers will be able to scan your web server, identify web server vulnerabilities, and pop into your network!</p>\n<p>No. mTLS requires the attacker to have a valid private key to authenticate to the reverse proxy. If a valid private key and certificate are not there, <strong>then the attacker cannot begin scanning the web app.</strong> The mTLS handshake happens before the attacker can probe the web service. If you don't believe me, use <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9eVf2uleaA\">WireShark and see how a TLS connection works</a>. Even over regular TLS, you will see that the TLS connection happens first, before any HTTP traffic is transmitted. Better yet, host your own mTLS instance, scan 443 without a private key and see what data you get back.</p>\n<p>3: If you expose a port, even if it requires a private key to connect to it, you are less secure than if you use WireGuard, which requires an authenticated packet before it responds.</p>\n<p>No. WireGuard allows you to avoid confirming or denying that a port is open, since it's over UDP and most systems don't respond if you try to interact to a nonexistent service over UDP. This, on its own, does not make WireGuard more secure than say TCP OpenVPN or mTLS. It does, however, prevent people looking at your IP address from knowing if you are running some sort of authentication-required service. If this increases your risk, then you can choose to use WireGuard, instead, but this is not the case for a vast majority of people.</p>\n<p>For more information on mTLS, see <a href=\"https://smallstep.com/docs/mtls/\">Hello mTLS</a> by the awesome people at Smallstep. They also have a cool tutorial on using Yubikeys with mTLS <a href=\"https://smallstep.com/blog/access-your-homelab-anywhere/\">here</a> to connect back to the homelab, similar to how OP is running his homelab.</p>\n<p>The great part about using Yubikeys for mTLS is it allows you to have a hardware-backed, two-factor authentication method at layer 6, rather than traditional MFA which is at layer 7. This allows MFA with a lower attack surface, since the attacker can't look for any web vulnerabilities to bypass MFA.</p>",

Of course I am not talking here about applications which involve serving dozens of devices and users with 99.99% uptime, I am talking home media server and some additional VMs/containers.</p>\n<p>Here is why:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Can be bought used for cheap (&lt;200\u20ac for i5 10th gen, 100\u20ac for 5-bay DAS). Most of the time better value than prebuilt NASs.</li>\n<li>Very small form factor and noise, perfect to hide in a closet somewhere or in the corner of a room.</li>\n<li>Some models can also be fitted with a NIC to go beyond gigabit speeds (alternatively, many mini PCs on Aliexpress now come with 2.5G).</li>\n<li>Very low power consumption. Maybe more relevant for Europe where electricity is not cheap.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Of course you could argue that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is usually less expandable, in terms of CPU/RAM/storage. Regarding the storage, if you buy a sufficiently large DAS from the start, you have room for additional drives later on.</li>\n<li>These machines are typically less capable than full-on servers but I believe that not everybody actually needs a server rack and 512GB RAM at home.</li>\n<li>They are also less reliable (not UPS, redundant power supply, etc) but for home purposes, I believe this is less relevant.</li>\n<li>DAS are sometime considered unreliable, especially with RAID setups. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>That's all I have, interested to hear your thoughts.</p>",

I'm here today to provide you with some changes I introduced in Dawarich.</p>\n<p>For those unfamiliar, <a href=\"https://github.com/Freika/dawarich\">Dawarich</a> is a self-hosted alternative to Google Location History and Owntracks</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/lgqgouibhdmd1.png?width=3096&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1c14ac4280aeefa50502d6856c5afe6f4f4d941</p>\n<p>So, the last time I posted an update here on Reddit, it was on Dawarich 0.7.0, more than two months ago. Today I'll share changes made to the application since, and in the future, I'm planning to post release updates on a monthly basis.</p>\n<p>I'll cover only significant changes, although there are also a whole lot of small ones. So, here we go!</p>\n<h1>Added</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Fog of War. Yes, exactly like in your favorite RTS game!</li>\n<li>Primitive user management. The first user in the system is now the admin and can create new users. Nobody will be able to use your Dawarich instance without your knowledge.</li>\n<li>Full support for the <a href=\"https://support.google.com/maps/thread/264641290/export-full-location-timeline-data-in-json-or-similar-format-in-the-new-version-of-timeline?hl=en\">third</a> (yes, third) kind of Google's Takeout location history file.</li>\n<li>A simple notification system. You'll receive a notification when any of your background processes is finished. Non-live yet, requires a page reload.</li>\n<li>API endpoints</li>\n<li>`/api/v1/areas` (GET, POST)</li>\n<li>`/api/v1/area/:id` (PATCH/PUT, DELETE)</li>\n<li>`/api/v1/points` (GET)</li>\n<li>`/api/v1/point/:id` (DELETE)</li>\n<li>`/api/v1/visit/:id` (PATCH/PUT)</li>\n<li>`/api/v1/stats` (GET)</li>\n<li>Swagger docs for the API. Available at `/api-docs`.</li>\n<li>Support for multiple hosts. You can now provide multiple domains and IP addresses by which you want Dawarich to be available.</li>\n<li>Support for HTTPS protocol.</li>\n<li>Background jobs page, where you can start or re-start the reverse geocoding process for your points.</li>\n<li>Point can now be deleted right from the map. Just click on it, and then click on \"Delete\" in the popup.</li>\n<li>Some map settings can now be changed in user settings.</li>\n<li>Those who want to host their own Photon instance for reverse geocoding without limitations now can do that and point Dawarich to it with `PHOTON_API_HOST` env variable.</li>\n<li>Visits functionality. You can now draw an area on the map, give it a name (i.e. \"Parent's house\") and Dawarich will scan your visits there and suggest them to be confirmed or declined on the Visits page.</li>\n<li>Places &amp; Visit suggestion. Oooh this is huge. And it's still in beta. Basically, Dawarich scans through all your points, detects groups of them in space and time, and makes a suggestion: this is a Visit. If possible (and if reverse geocoding is enabled), it will also try to suggest a name of the place you visited.</li>\n<li>Map settings are moved directly to the map itself</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Fixed</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Hovering over a route on the Map page will no longer move the map. But click on a route will, it will move to show both the start and the finish of the route.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Changed</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Registration is now disabled and new users can be only created by the very first user in the system (or an admin, or via console).</li>\n<li>Reverse geocoding process now saves all data it fetched, not just city and country</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, I'd like to talk a bit about Visits suggestions. It's currently in its beta version, and the ultimate goal is to have Dawarich reliably suggest places you visited, also providing you with a list of names of potential places that you could have visited. Current implementation if a first step, and initial visits suggestion, depending on the amount of points you tracked or imported, might take a few hours and consume some considerable resources. With that in mind, it might be smart to limit resources (like that, for example: <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42345235/how-to-specify-memory-cpu-limit-in-docker-compose-version-3\">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42345235/how-to-specify-memory-cpu-limit-in-docker-compose-version-3</a> ) available to Dawarich to not crash your server.</p>\n<p>The main focus for now would be probably honing existing features, especially the Visits suggestions feature, although I'll also be working on some other stuff, such as extending the API, supporting different types of export files, and some others. I invite you all to <a href=\"https://github.com/Freika/dawarich/discussions\">Github Discussions</a> to ask your questions and bring your ideas.</p>\n<p>Feel free to support the project on <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/freika\">Patreon</a>, <a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/freika\">Ko-fi</a> or using crypto (address is in the project README) if you find it useful :)</p>\n<p>To save you a scroll:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Freika/dawarich\">https://github.com/Freika/dawarich</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://dawarich.app\">https://dawarich.app</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cheers!</p>",

One redditor labeled them NPC dads. </p>\n<p>I've seen some comments on this subreddit from Dads who wonder if their kids appreciate the sweet setup they've created for them. If you feel that way, you may be confusing effort with value. Sure, you spend a lot of time and put in a lot of hard work, and it feels worth it. But for the rest of your family, it probably just looks like you're playing games, and if we're being fair, we kind of are -- we enjoy the challenge and the opportunity to learn soemthing new, which is basically makes selfhosting a semi productive game. </p>\n<p>Is it worth it? You may see yourself as a hero, but doesn't everybody want to be the hero of their own story? You might want to check with your family (your spouse included) if they think it's all worth your time, or if they'd rather you spent time with them or helped out in other ways. </p>",

It's a native app unlike official client, so it uses less memory, and more battery-efficient.</p>\n<p>Over past few months I've added a bunch of changes, fixes and improvements. The most notable are</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Playlist support - create/delete playlists, add/remove songs from playlists</li>\n<li>Media keys support on MacOS(play/pause next/prev)</li>\n<li>Dynamic progress bar color(matches album cover art dominant color)</li>\n<li>Sorting</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are many more changes under the hood to make app more stable. App is fully open sourced and available to check here - <a href=\"https://github.com/avdept/JellyBoxPlayer\">https://github.com/avdept/JellyBoxPlayer</a></p>\n<p>Right now I support macOS, iOS and android as APK file in downloads section(soon I will release it to google play).</p>\n<p>There are few more features I currently work on, so stay tuned!</p>",

I'm super psyched to have a new toy to play around with.</p>\n<p>I don't have any experience with rack servers. I've been using a mini PC and my first PC build as servers up until now. One has Ubuntu server for Plex, Minecraft, FoundryVTT, and probably some other things I can't remember. My other one has Proxmox set up for VMs. I'm hoping to get NextCloud and whatever else I can come up with set up on this thing.</p>\n<p>I don't have a lot of space for a rack server in my home, however. There is no room for rack anywhere at this point. Would it be fine if I just kept it on a shelf in my utility room like this? The vents aren't covered up or anything, but I'm not sure how warm the chassis will get when it is running. </p>\n<p>I'm open to suggestions of any kind! </p><div><br></div><img src=\"https://i.redd.it/n7k6o31jw2id1.jpeg\" />",

It was shut down without any warning. We were put under curfew 24/7, so no leaving home. </p>\n<p>On the second day of curfew, me, with nothing to do, figured the intranet in our country still worked. So I opened my Jellyfin service up and gave access to my immediate family and friends. Then we had people stepping up. One opened a simple chat application. Believe me, I never felt happier reading messages from a bunch of random people on the internet. Once people started communicating it only got better. We had a jitsi meet up and running within a few hours. People opened up their media library. Last couple of days, I almost didn't miss the traditional internet.</p>\n<p>I have to thank you guys for all the encouragement. \nAlso I do have a few questions for you guys.</p>\n<p>I'm fearing this will not be the last time we will be blocked from the world. What can we do to make things even better next time?\nOne major problem was TLS CERTS stopped working. So the communication was in http using IP address </p>\n<p>What are some apps to host if the same situation to arise again?</p>\n<p>Sorry for the bad English, not my first language.</p>",

After the last announcement on a wording change in response to our mishap of using the words <code>licensed</code> and <code>unlicensed</code>, the team and I gave it a long hard thought over the weekend.</p>\n<p>I thought about it when I went to bed, I thought about it in my dream, I thought about it while doing the dishes. Taking into consideration all of your feedback and suggestions, and on behalf of the team, I am happy to show you what we came up with.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There will be no <code>license</code> or <code>unlicensed</code>.</li>\n<li>We will change <code>License Key</code> to <code>Product Key</code>.</li>\n<li>We will show a \"Buy Immich\" button as the call to action. The button will only be shown if the account age is older than 14 days.</li>\n<li>We will give you options to hide the button for 30 days or indefinitely.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/qsrbqrn3y9ed1.png?width=886&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce958f44efd25718bb0438f1bdb12e57c8ab0166</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We will change the price to a whole number <code>$100</code> and <code>$25</code>. So get your product key now and you can save <code>$0.01</code> \ud83d\ude04</li>\n<li>We will add text to make our mission and intentions clear.</li>\n<li>We will refine the text about each option to clarify the content.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/qbkhzb43y9ed1.png?width=1053&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd3bb965088009ebefedd90b05536c031b4bdf2a</p>\n<p>Last but not least, we will add a fancy <code>Supporter Badge</code> to recognize those who purchase the product. If you have any ideas for making it \"shinier,\" let us know!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff1edb43-1838-45b9-85ed-1944645291f8\">https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff1edb43-1838-45b9-85ed-1944645291f8</a></p>\n<p>Thank you again for your support and feedback.
