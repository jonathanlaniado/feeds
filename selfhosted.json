            "content_html": "<p>Hello Everyone,</p>\n<p>A month or so ago, I found myself in an argument on the r/yuri_manga discord debating self-hosted manga archive options. The general consensus was \"CBZ is fine. It is what it is.\" I said I would make something better.</p>\n<p>So I did. My solution is the <strong>Bound Book Format</strong>.</p>\n<h2>The problems I've had with CBZ</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>No Random Access. CBZ spikes CPU usage when scrubbing through pages.</li>\n<li>Slow Integrity Checking. Integrity checks can be time-consuming with large libraries.</li>\n<li>If one file is corrupt, the whole thing won't open.</li>\n<li>Metadata isn't native to CBZ, you have to use a <code>ComicInfo.xml</code> file.</li>\n<li>If you have a long-running manhwa or manga, the same \"Credits.jpg\", \"ScanlationGroup.png\" or blank pages are stored hundreds of times, wasting gigabytes. </li>\n</ol>\n<h2>The Solution (BBF)</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Zero-Copy Architecture. The file is 4KB-aligned. We map the file directly from disk to memory/GPU. No buffers, no copying. BBF is DirectStorage ready.</li>\n<li>XXH3 Parallel Hashing. Integrity checks are extremely fast.</li>\n<li>Native Metadata and Chapters. You can embed metadata in BBF files easily, without any XML parsing. You can also add custom Chapters and Sections.</li>\n<li>Footer-Based Index. BBF doesn't have to parse a central directory, it only has to read the footer to know where every page is.</li>\n<li>Content Deduplication. For those storing manhwa in CBZ format, CBZ stores duplicate images. BBF's content deduplication can result in several hundred deduplicated pages, saving lots of space.</li>\n<li>Per-Asset Hashes. Every asset (and the footer) has an associated XXH3 hash with it, so you can quickly verify the entire book or just a single page nearly instantly.</li>\n<li>Non-destructive. Images inside are bit-exact copies. No re-encoding.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I have a more in-depth comparison on the <a href=\"https://github.com/ef1500/libbbf?tab=readme-ov-file#feature-comparison-digital-comic--archival-formats\">github repo</a>.</p>\n<h2><strong>\"B-but</strong> <a href=\"https://xkcd.com/927/\"><strong>XKCD 927</strong></a><strong>!\"</strong></h2>\n<p>I'm not creating a unifying standard for everyone's use case. I'm solving a few problems that have bugged me for years. CBZ is also just a ZIP file, it's not built for comics. BBF is.</p>\n<h2><strong>Where to get it</strong></h2>\n<p>This project is 100% open sourced, and licensed under the MIT license.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>C++ Core &amp; Spec:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/ef1500/libbbf\">https://github.com/ef1500/libbbf</a></li>\n<li><strong>Python Bindings &amp; CLI Tools:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/ef1500/libbbf-python\">https://github.com/ef1500/libbbf-python</a> or <code>pip install libbbf</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The python bindings include conversion scripts to convert between CBZ and BBF (cbx2bbf, bbf2cbx). You won't lose your cbz files, and you can convert back to cbz at any time.</p>\n<p><em>(Note: The tool handles image data perfectly, but parsing existing XML metadata and nested folders is currently a work-in-progress.)</em></p>\n<h2><strong>How to get involved</strong></h2>\n<p>I have numbers to back me up. I've got binaries and python packages. What I need right now is adoption. I'm looking for feedback from other archivists, and for devs that are interested in adding support for this in their readers.</p>\n<p>Cheers :-)</p><div><br></div><img src=\"https://i.redd.it/eswczyx88jeg1.png\" />",

            "content_html": "<p>Hello there,</p>\n<p>I'm proud to share major development updates for <a href=\"https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe\">XPipe</a>, a connection hub that allows you to access and manage your entire server infrastructure from your local desktop. XPipe works on top of your installed command-line programs and does not require any setup on your remote systems. It integrates with your favourite text editors, terminals, shells, VNC/RDP clients, password managers, and other command-line tools.</p>\n<p>It has been over a year since I last posted here (I try not to spam announcements), so there are a lot of improvements that were added since then. Here is a short summary of the recent updates since then:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://xpipe.io/blog/xpipe-14-released\">v14</a> (Jan 25): Team vaults, reusable identities, incus support</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://xpipe.io/blog/xpipe-15-released\">v15</a> (Feb 25): Tailscale SSH support, custom connection icons, apt and rpm package manager repos</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://xpipe.io/blog/xpipe-16-released\">v16</a> (Apr 25): Docker compose support, terminal multiplexer + prompt support, batch mode, KeePassXC support</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://xpipe.io/blog/xpipe-17-released\">v17</a> (Jul 25): Scriptable automation actions, SSH jump servers, external VNC client support, Windows ARM builds</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://xpipe.io/blog/xpipe-18-released\">v18</a> (Sep 25): MCP server, Hetzner cloud support, automatic network scan, multiple host addresses</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://xpipe.io/blog/xpipe-19-released\">v19</a> (Nov 25): Netbird support, legacy unix system support, abstract hosts, pure SFTP support</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://xpipe.io/blog/xpipe-20-released\">v20</a> (Dec 25): AWS support, SSH key generation, tags, split terminal panes</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>About</strong></p>\n<p>Here is a full list of what connection types are currently supported:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>SSH connections, config files, and tunnels</li>\n<li>Docker, Podman, LXD, and incus containers</li>\n<li>Proxmox PVE, Hyper-V, KVM, VMware Player/Workstation/Fusion virtual machines</li>\n<li>Tailscale, Netbird, and Teleport connections</li>\n<li>AWS and Hetzner Cloud servers</li>\n<li>Windows Subsystem for Linux, Cygwin, and MSYS2 environments</li>\n<li>Powershell Remote Sessions</li>\n<li>RDP and VNC connections</li>\n<li>Kubernetes clusters, pods, and containers</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can access servers in the cloud, containers, clusters, VMs, and more all in the same way. Each integration works together with all the others, allowing you an almost infinite number of connection combinations and nesting depth. You want to manage a docker container running on a private VM running on a server that you can only reach from the outside through a bastion host via SSH? You can do that with XPipe.</p>\n<p><strong>SSH</strong></p>\n<p>XPipe supports the complete SSH stack through its OpenSSH integration. This support includes config files, agents, jump servers, tunnels, hardware security keys, X11 forwarding, ssh keygen, automatic network discovery, and more. It also integrates with the SSH remote workspaces feature of vscode-based editors.</p>\n<p><strong>Containers, VMs, and more</strong></p>\n<p>XPipe supports interacting with many different container runtimes, hypervisors, and other types of environments. This means that you can connect to virtual machines, containers, and more with one click. You can also perform various commonly used actions like starting/stopping systems, establishing tunnels, inspecting logs, open serial terminals, and more.</p>\n<p><strong>Terminals</strong></p>\n<p>XPipes comes with integrations for almost every terminal tool out there, so chances are high that you can keep using your favourite terminal setup in combination with XPipe. It also supports terminal multiplexers like tmux and zellij, plus prompt tools like starship and oh-my-zsh. Through the shell script support, you can also bring your dotfiles and other customizations to your remote shell sessions automatically.</p>\n<p><strong>Password managers</strong></p>\n<p>Via the available password manager integrations, you can configure XPipe to retrieve passwords from your locally installed password manager. That way, XPipe doesn't have to store any secrets itself, they are only queried at runtime. There are many different integrations available for most popular password managers.</p>\n<p><strong>Synchronization</strong></p>\n<p>XPipe can synchronize all connection configuration data across multiple installations by creating a git repository for its own data. The local git repository can then be linked to any remote repository. This remote git repository can be linked to other XPipe installations to automatically get an up-to-date version of all connection data, on any system you currently are on. And this in a manner that is self-hosted as you have full control over how and where you host this remote git repository. XPipe's sync does not involve any services outside your control.</p>\n<p><strong>Service tunnels</strong></p>\n<p>The service integration provides a way to open and securely tunnel any kind of remote ports to your local machine over an existing connection. This can be some web dashboard running in a container, the PVE dashboard, or anything else really. XPipe will use the tunneling features of SSH to establish these tunnels, also over multiple hops if needed. Once a tunnel is established, you can choose how to open the tunneled port as well. For example, in your web browser if you tunneled an HTTP service.</p>\n<p><strong>Reusable identities</strong></p>\n<p>You can create reusable identities for connections instead of having to enter authentication information for each connection separately. This will make it easier to handle any authentication changes later on, as only one config has to be changed. These identities can be local-only or also synced via the git synchronization. You can also create new identities from scratch with the ssh keygen integration and furthermore apply identities automatically to remote systems to quickly perform a key rotation.</p>\n<p><strong>RDP and VNC</strong></p>\n<p>In line with the general concept of external application integrations, the support for RDP and VNC involves XPipe calling your RDP/VNC client with the correct configuration so it can start up automatically. This can also include establishing tunnels if needed. All popular RDP and VNC clients are supported. XPipe also comes with its own basic VNC client if you don't have another VNC client around.</p>\n<p><strong>Connection icons</strong></p>\n<p>You can set custom icons for any connection to better organize individual ones. For example, if you connect to an opnsense or immich system, you can mark it with the correct icon of that service. A huge shoutout to <a href=\"https://github.com/selfhst/icons\">https://github.com/selfhst/icons</a> for providing the icons, without them this would have not been possible. You can further choose to add custom icon sources from a remote git repository, XPipe will automatically pull changes and rasterize any .svg icons for you.</p>\n<p><strong>A note on the open-source model</strong></p>\n<p>Since it has come up a few times, in addition to the note in the git repository, I would like to clarify that XPipe is not fully FOSS software. The core that you can find on GitHub is Apache 2.0 licensed, but the distribution you download ships with closed-source extensions. There's also a licensing system in place with limitations on what kind of systems you can connect to in the community edition as I am trying to make a living out of this. You can find details at <a href=\"https://xpipe.io/pricing\">https://xpipe.io/pricing</a>. I understand that this is a deal-breaker for some, so I wanted to give a heads-up.</p>\n<p><strong>Outlook</strong></p>\n<p>If this project sounds interesting to you, you can check it out on <a href=\"https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe\">GitHub</a> and check out the <a href=\"https://docs.xpipe.io/\">Docs</a> for more information.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>",

But you look at your <code>htop</code> and see... unused RAM.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s disgusting, isn't it?</p>\n<p>So I built <strong>Hypermind</strong>.</p>\n<p>Hypermind is a completely decentralized, peer-to-peer deployment counter. It does exactly one thing: <em>It solves the critical infrastructure challenge of knowing exactly how many other people are currently wasting 50MB of RAM running this specific container.</em></p>\n<p>That\u2019s it. That\u2019s the whole app.</p>\n<p>Despite being useless, the tech stack is actually kind of neat.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>No Central Server: This runs on the Hyperswarm DHT (Distributed Hash Table).</li>\n<li>P2P Discovery: Your node announces itself to the swarm and gossips with peers.</li>\n<li>Ephemeral: If everyone turns off their container, the network dies. If one person turns it on, they are the Creator of the Universe.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>How to join the Swarm</p>\n<p>If you have extra RAM you hate, run this:</p>\n<pre><code>docker run -d \\\n  --name hypermind \\\n  --network host \\\n  --restart unless-stopped \\\n  -e PORT=3000 \\\n  ghcr.io/lklynet/hypermind:latest\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> You must use <code>--network host</code> because P2P DHTs need to punch through NATs, and Docker networking hates fun.</p>\n<p>Open <code>http://localhost:3000</code>. You'll see a realtime counter of active nodes with a physical representation via the particle system.</p>\n<p>GitHub Repo: <a href=\"https://github.com/lklynet/hypermind\">https://github.com/lklynet/hypermind</a></p>\n<p>Let\u2019s see how high we can get this number before my gf asks why the electric bill went up.</p>\n<p>Remember that with Hypermind, you're never truly alone. \u2661 </p><div><br></div><img src=\"https://i.redd.it/nq2m0eo1ayag1.png\" />",

            "content_html": "<p>In a couple of months, Karakeep will be two years old. 2025 has been a wild year, so that's a quick lookback about what happened in 2025, and while you're here, I can tell you about the 0.30 release.</p>\n<p><em>EDIT: For those who don't know what</em> <a href=\"https://karakeep.app/\"><em>karakeep</em></a> <em>is, it's a bookmark manager that's designed for easy sharing and fast retrieval with opt-in AI tagging and summarization.</em></p>\n<p>Let's start by some stats:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Karakeep started the year with \\~10k stars on Github, we're now at 22k stars!</li>\n<li>We had 8 major releases in 2025 starting from 0.21 (the 10k stars release), and ending with 0.29. We had 819 commits in 2025.</li>\n<li>I have no idea how many active installations there are for karakeep, but apple and google give me some stats about the mobile apps usage, and we're at \\~7.5k monthly active users (MAU) on the mobile apps. On the extensions side, google suggests that we have 29k weekly active users (wth!) and firefox says we have 2.5k daily active users.</li>\n<li>We're ending the year with 159 contributors on Github (can't be thankful enough) and \\~800 members in our discord server.</li>\n<li>1 name change, \u00a38k in lawyer fees and a successful trademark registration.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The year had a crazy start, we had our moment of fame on the frontpage of hackernews, followed by the now-infamous hoarder saga. After a couple of months of trademark nonsense, we ended up changing the app's name to Karakeep. Back then, I was afraid that the name change would kill the momentum, but I was wrong and Karakeep ended up more famous than Hoarder ever was. As of two days ago, we're now the proud owners of the \"Karakeep\" trademark to hopefully deter future trolls.</p>\n<p>Another big event this year, was the launch of Karakeep cloud. Trying to fill the gap that pocket left, share the product with non-techies, and go through the full productionization journey of the product which was quite interesting.</p>\n<p>Karakeep was born out of this subreddit, got popular because of it, and it's what's keeping me going. (confession: I read every mention of karakeep in this sub). It honestly warms my heart every time I see karakeep being recommended here. Thank you, happy new year and looking forward to a strong 2026!</p>\n<p>While you're here, I've just released <a href=\"https://github.com/karakeep-app/karakeep/releases/tag/v0.30.0\">v0.30</a>, which includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Karakeep wrapped 2025 (a bit late).</li>\n<li>PDF archives</li>\n<li>Better metadata extraction for reddit, youtube and amazon. Reddit in particular used to be a common pain point which is hopefully now addressed.</li>\n<li>Reader settings that are synced across all devices to better improve the read-it-later part of karakeep.</li>\n<li>Customization of AI settings per user (toggling it on/off, changing the language and also the tagging style).</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.karakeep.app/\">Our docs</a> got a big revamp in terms of styling, organization and also some new content. We now have a \"Using karakeep\" section that talks about the different concepts of karakeep.</li>\n<li>The mobile app also got a bunch of UI/UX improvements.</li>\n<li>And a lot more mentioned in the <a href=\"https://github.com/karakeep-app/karakeep/releases/tag/v0.30.0\">release notes</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Finally, I'm collecting testimonials for karakeep to put them on the homepage. If you\u2019ve been using it and feel like sharing a few words, I\u2019d appreciate it.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>Merry Christmas everyone.</p>\n<p>I've been self hosting for about 2 years now. Nextcloud, Immich, Plex, Audiobookshelf, all that. Audio was the only thing that actively disappoints me. Jellyfin and Plex are OK for music but Jellyfin is finnicky AF and the Plex app for some reason doesn't send a keep-awake signal when listening to music so my TV will shut off. Just frustration after frustration.</p>\n<p>I've seen tons of posts on here asking for a FOSS music app like Spotify and have searched for that myself. Lidify is my answer to that. And yes, I regret the name since this turned into much more than a Lidarr frontend. Here's what's available now (with bugs I'm sure):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Vibe System:</strong> You ever listen to a song that just hits different in the moment? You don't know exactly what it is, you just know you're absolutely feeling it and then go on a journey trying to find other songs that give you that same feeling but come up empty? The vibe system is my solution to that. It analyzes tracks using data from MusicBrainz and <a href=\"http://Last.fm\">Last.fm</a> paired with ML analysis through Essentia. It'll be a forever work in progress but it works pretty well already.</li>\n<li><strong>Made For You playlists</strong> (era mixes, genre mixes, rediscover tracks you haven't played in a while)</li>\n<li><strong>Discover Weekly</strong> that actually downloads recommendations if you have Lidarr and/or Soulseek set up</li>\n<li><strong>Spotify/Deezer playlist import</strong> (also dependent on Lidarr + Soulseek)</li>\n<li><strong>Podcasts via RSS</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Audiobookshelf integration</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Multi user with 2FA</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>PWA works on mobile, native app coming later.</p>\n<p>This is a passion project I built for myself but I'd love input and feature ideas from everyone. GPL-3.0, so fork it, break it, make it your own.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Chevron7Locked/lidify/\">https://github.com/Chevron7Locked/lidify/</a></p>",

            "content_html": "<p>dear diary:</p>\n<p>I always were a tech savy dude, but rarely got in touch with linux or self hosting before 2024.</p>\n<p>Early 2024 I started experimenting with a pihole + unbound on a rasperry 4, because I could'nt stand the amount of brainshrinking ads on the internet anymore.</p>\n<p>Mid 2024, after Microsoft announced the end of W10, I completly migrated to Linux within a month (Using PoP!_OS as my beloved daily driver since then), because W11 is the biggest fraud that could have been brought among humans.</p>\n<p>Then most streaming services raised there subscription prices like... monthly? This was the time I found out something named jellyfin existed. I bought a bunch of second hand media, some big HDDs and hosted everything on my main pc to tinker with. Shortly after I built a nice library. I cancelled all my subscriptions afterwards.</p>\n<p>All what followed explains itself - bought a NAS, more HDDs, more media, imported all my audiobooks, worked out some plans to safely backup my stuff. It became an addiction to own my data, and I understood its worth the work and the cost.</p>\n<p>Soon it became complicated and kinda unsecure hosting everything on my main pc, so I went to the next step and bought a mini PC to host my stuff in a better and convinient way. I learned about Proxmox and containerization.</p>\n<p>Thanks to llms I was able to vibe code a cool looking Dashboard where I can access all my services from, integrated Caldav, and my most visited sites. It legit became the startpage of my browser (I'm a Vivaldi enjoyer).</p>\n<p>Then my own documentation followed because my homenet grew and grew. I hosted Bookstack to keep tracks of my configurations, chasing the goal to keep track of what I did and learned the previous year.</p>\n<p>Thanks to great documentation and llms I ended up securing all my services behind Nginx and proper ufw roles (I never touched a firewall or proxy in my live before), I learned so much about this cool topic! Network security even became my favourite topic about self hosting.</p>\n<p>After my services were properly secured (hoping that at least) I looked at wireguard. I bought a linux tablet running ubuntu to stay in my ecosystem, and since then I was able to safely access all my data, my servers and everything I need from anywhere.</p>\n<p>My next step is to self host paperlessngx, which should lead me to the world of docker. I never used it, but I am very curious if this will work inside  proxmox.</p>\n<p>Here I am now, asking myself weekly what I should host next. The itch is strong...</p>\n<p><strong>Tldr:</strong> Began self hosting as an act of self-defense, got addicted by the feel of digital independence, and stayed because its funny and interesting.</p><div><br></div><img src=\"https://i.redd.it/qtjcrgjrqj8g1.png\" />",

It is built for iOS and iPadOS (optimized for both), and also available on macOS, so you can browse, manage, and keep track of everything in one place without bouncing between separate apps and web UIs.</p>\n<p><strong>Currently supported:</strong></p>\n<p>Sonarr, Radarr, Lidarr, Bazarr, Seerr (Overseerr &amp; Jellyseerr), Tautulli, Jellystat, SABnzbd, NZBGet, qBittorrent, Unraid, SSH, Wizarr, Transmission (coming soon).</p>\n<p><strong>Feature highlights:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unified library browsing and management</li>\n<li>Requests (Overseerr, Jellyseerr, Seerr)</li>\n<li>Calendar for upcoming releases</li>\n<li>Activities like downloads, history, and status</li>\n<li>Release filters for video, audio quality and formats</li>\n<li>Add and manage media directly</li>\n<li>Release picker / release browser for better control over what gets grabbed</li>\n<li>Download management for SABnzbd, NZBGet and qBittorrent (pause, resume, reorder, speed limits, etc.)</li>\n<li>Push notifications for Sonarr, Radarr, Lidarr, Seerr and Tautulli</li>\n<li>Home screen widgets (queue, upcoming, stats, more are coming)</li>\n<li>Deep customization (accent colors, layout, tab bar, custom headers, etc.)</li>\n<li>Smart connectivity with multi-network support (primary + fallback hosts, auto switching LAN/WAN)</li>\n<li>Unraid monitoring + control (shares, parity, disks, warnings, Docker containers, VMs)</li>\n<li>SSH terminal access with live resource monitoring (CPU/RAM/Net)</li>\n<li>and so much more, try it out! </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Pricing:</strong></p>\n<p>I see Helmarr as a paid app that you buy once and be done forever, but I still wanted it to be easy to try, so every service has a free mode that lets you explore most of its features.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lifetime unlocks: Purchase individual services, or get the \u201cAll Services\u201d lifetime option (best value). Family Sharing is included on all lifetime purchases, and the full unlock also covers any services added in the future.</li>\n<li>Ultra subscription: Unlocks everything as well. It doesn\u2019t add features beyond cosmetics, it\u2019s mainly for anyone who wants to support continued development. \ud83e\udef6</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Beta and a huge thank you \u2764\ufe0f</strong></p>\n<p>The beta honestly went way beyond what I expected. We had over 3,000 people in TestFlight, with about 800 to 1,000 active every day and over 300 in the Discord. The amount of feedback, bug reports, and suggestions I got was insane, and it directly shaped the app into what it is now.</p>\n<p>Thank you to everyone who took the time to test, send screenshots, report issues, and point out the little details. I read everything, and I am not slowing down on feature development and bug fixing.</p>\n<p><strong>Links:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>App Store:</strong> <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/helmarr/id1638624921\"><strong>https://apps.apple.com/us/app/helmarr/id1638624921</strong></a></p>\n<p><strong>Website:</strong> <a href=\"https://helmarr.com\"><strong>https://helmarr.com</strong></a></p>\n<p><strong>Discord:</strong> <a href=\"https://discord.gg/sJRqaXNtxs\"><strong>https://discord.gg/sJRqaXNtxs</strong></a></p><div><br></div><img src=\"https://i.redd.it/xosonkzrh68g1.png\" />",

            "content_html": "<p>I run a Plex server for family. But \"family\" turned into friends, then friends of friends, then some guy my cousin works with. I started wondering who was actually using my server and if accounts were getting passed around.</p>\n<p>Other tools show you what happened. They don't tell you when something looks off. So I built Tracearr.</p>\n<h1>What it does</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Session tracking</strong> - who watched what, when, from where, on what device</li>\n<li><strong>IP geolocation</strong> - city, region, country for every stream</li>\n<li><strong>Sharing detection</strong> - five rule types:</li>\n<li>Impossible travel (NYC then London 30 min later)</li>\n<li>Simultaneous locations (same account, two cities, same time)</li>\n<li>Device velocity (way too many IPs in a short window)</li>\n<li>Concurrent streams (set limits per user)</li>\n<li>Geo restrictions (block countries)</li>\n<li><strong>Trust scores</strong> - users build or lose trust over time. Get alerts via Discord, ntfy, webhooks</li>\n<li><strong>Stream map</strong> - see where your streams are coming from on a map, live or historical</li>\n<li><strong>Multi-server</strong> - Plex, Jellyfin, Emby all in one place</li>\n<li><strong>Kill streams</strong> - terminate sessions from the UI</li>\n<li><strong>Import history</strong> - pull in your Tautulli or Jellystat data</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>What I've found on my own server</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>A \"family member\" who was streaming from Boston and Detroit on the same day</li>\n<li>One account shared between at least 3 people in 2 different countries</li>\n<li>Someone who hit 15 unique IPs in a single month</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>How it compares to Others</h1>\n<p>Same ideas as Tautulli and JellyStat - watch history, stats, session monitoring. Difference is Tracearr adds sharing detection rules on top. You can run both, they don't conflict.</p>\n<p>Other tools do watch history and stats well. But they slow down quickly with years of data, and if you run multiple servers you need multiple instances.</p>\n<p>Tech stack is Fastify + TimescaleDB. Uses continuous aggregates so queries stay fast even with years of history.</p>\n<h1>Privacy</h1>\n<p>100% self-hosted. No cloud, no telemetry, nothing phones home. Your data stays on your box.</p>\n<h1>Quick Start</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/connorgallopo/Tracearr/blob/main/docker/docker-compose.supervised.yml\">All-in-one (includes Postgres + Redis)</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/connorgallopo/Tracearr/blob/main/docker/docker-compose.yml\">Three Service Stack (Tracearr, TimescaleDB, Redis)</a></p>\n<h1>Not done yet</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Automated stream kills via rules (manual only right now)</li>\n<li>Email/Telegram (Discord and webhooks work)</li>\n<li>Mobile app exists but still in beta (Testflight now available!)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Links</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/connorgallopo/Tracearr\">https://github.com/connorgallopo/Tracearr</a></li>\n<li>Discord: <a href=\"https://discord.gg/a7n3sFd2Yw\">https://discord.gg/a7n3sFd2Yw</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If anyone runs Jellyfin or Emby, I'd really like to know how it works for you. I've hammered on Plex but the other two need more real-world testing.</p>\n<p>What other detection rules would be useful? Anything you wish other monitoring tools did that they don't do now?</p>\n<p>Also, want to say a big  thanks to the early adopters from the Discord community - Bramble, killerbyte1985, nzbnate, SuperKing, and WildWayz , coyuya, Jam, IamSpartacus and Zass - who've been finding bugs and suggesting features since day one. A lot of what's in there now came from their feedback.</p>\n<p>Thank you for taking a look!</p>\n<p>Gallapagos</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>More than 2 years have passed since I last updated you on the progress of <a href=\"https://github.com/TandoorRecipes/recipes\">Tandoor</a>. Today I am happy to share some great developments with you and answer all your questions.</p>\n<p>After more than 1.5 years of work Tandoor 2 was finally released on the 31.07.2025. While you can read all about it in the <a href=\"https://github.com/TandoorRecipes/recipes/releases/tag/2.0.0\">changelog </a>I want to highlight some aspects.</p>\n<p>If you don't want to read and just see what's new, take a look at the <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/tandoor-2-overview-owUAO46\">gallery</a>.</p>\n<h1>New Single Page Frontend</h1>\n<p>While Tandoor 1 already used Vue 2 for most of its pages Tandoor 2 is now a modern single page application based on Vue 3 with Vuetify 3 providing elegant and efficient UI components.</p>\n<p>Not only does this make Tandoor 2 a whole lot faster than the old version, but it also resolves lots of the small little quirks and rough edges that, at times, created a frustrating experience.</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/bunydpr21m2g1.png?width=2307&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=651530e6cc0afd6abc13f2df066170b6f894d3f8</p>\n<p>I have also spent a great deal of time on building a great framework to make developing new features a lot easier than it used to be. With that I have already been able to add several interesting new features since the initial release of Tandoor 2.</p>\n<h1>AI</h1>\n<p>While I am not a fan of the AI hype and adding AI to everything, there are a few things I always wanted to have in Tandoor that work great with AI. Currently you can import recipes from images and PDF or text files, convert external recipes, automatically generate nutritional values and sort ingredients and steps. </p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/q7qiygdb5m2g1.png?width=1396&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=460854903a96c6b603acd0d4d83de060ce2d0ed0</p>\n<p>To given you the maximum possible freedom you can configure as many AI Providers as you want directly from the UI, select them for different tasks and even log and limit your usage to prevent accidental costs. This of course works with self-hosted LLM providers as well.</p>\n<p>There are many interesting ideas still planned to solve more day-to-day problems using AI. Feel free to add your ideas and feedback <a href=\"https://github.com/TandoorRecipes/recipes/issues/3840\">here</a>.</p>\n<h1>Batch editing</h1>\n<p>Batch editing was something I always wanted to do properly and while Tandoor 1 had a bare minimum batch Keyword assigner it always lacked this functionality.<br />\nWith Tandoor 2 you can now quickly batch edit all fields that make sense in both Recipes and Foods. It is also possible to batch delete all different kinds of objects and batch merge all objects that support merging.</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/rnxjkm4l5m2g1.png?width=1195&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=842110bc076be52ea3330112c818f1f5b4b5c757</p>\n<p>The general support for all models has also improved: Every model has its own, searchable, list page and custom editors that you can link to and that will warn you when trying to close them without saving. Many models also have advanced delete pages, allowing you to see how deleting something will affect the rest of your data.</p>\n<h1>Other Highlights</h1>\n<p>While the changelog will show you all the updates here are a few more of my personal favourites in no particular order</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add Shopping List Entries manually directly from the Meal Plan page</li>\n<li>Quickly create conversions an add missing properties from the recipe view and see which ingredients make up the different property types</li>\n<li>Summary of ingredients used by a recipe</li>\n<li>New Space setup wizard to set basic preferences and data</li>\n<li>Direct linking to all search views</li>\n<li>AI based automatic conversion of external recipes</li>\n<li>Much improved plugin architecture</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thank you all for reading and the continued support this Sub has given to my project. The development of Tandoor 2 started in January of 2024. Since then, hundreds if not thousands of hours of work have been put into building the foundation for Tandoors future. If you want to help me in continuing this effort, feel free to <a href=\"https://github.com/sponsors/vabene1111\">sponsor this project</a>.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Termix-SSH/Termix\">GitHub</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://discord.gg/jVQGdvHDrf\">Discord</a></p>\n<p>Hello,</p>\n<p>It's been a while since I've made a post here, so I'd like to make an update. If you didn't already know: Termix is an open-source, forever-free, self-hosted all-in-one server management platform. It provides a multi-platform solution for managing your servers and infrastructure through a single, intuitive interface. Termix offers SSH terminal access, SSH tunneling capabilities, and remote file management, with additional tools to be introduced in the future. Termix is the perfect free and self-hosted alternative to Termius available for all platforms.</p>\n<p>As of a few days ago, v1.8.0 has been released. With this update, it means Termix is available for installation on the following platforms, all synced together with the self-hosted Docker container:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Website (any modern browser on any platform, like Chrome, Safari, and Firefox)</li>\n<li>Windows (x64/ia32)</li>\n<li>Portable</li>\n<li>MSI Installer</li>\n<li>Chocolatey Package Manager (waiting for approval)</li>\n<li>Linux (x64/ia32)</li>\n<li>Portable</li>\n<li>AppImage</li>\n<li>Deb</li>\n<li>Flatpak (waiting for approval)</li>\n<li>macOS (x64/ia32 on v12.0+)</li>\n<li>Apple App Store (waiting for approval)</li>\n<li>DMG</li>\n<li>Homebrew (waiting for approval)</li>\n<li>iOS/iPadOS (v15.1+)</li>\n<li>Apple App Store</li>\n<li>ISO</li>\n<li>Android (v7.0+)</li>\n<li>Google Play Store</li>\n<li>APK</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With these changes, I'm hoping it provides a solution to ditch the Termius monthly subscription with a no bullshit alternative. Some more notable features include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>SSH Terminal Access - Full-featured terminal with split-screen support (up to 4 panels) with a browser-like tab system. Includes support for customizing the terminal, including common terminal themes, fonts, and other components</li>\n<li>SSH Tunnel Management - Create and manage SSH tunnels with automatic reconnection and health monitoring</li>\n<li>Remote File Manager - Manage files directly on remote servers with support for viewing and editing code, images, audio, and video. Upload, download, rename, delete, and move files seamlessly</li>\n<li>SSH Host Manager - Save, organize, and manage your SSH connections with tags and folders, and easily save reusable login info while being able to automate the deployment of SSH keys</li>\n<li>Server Stats - View CPU, memory, and disk usage along with network, uptime, and system information on any SSH server</li>\n<li>Dashboard - View server information at a glance on your dashboard</li>\n<li>User Authentication - Secure user management with admin controls and OIDC and 2FA (TOTP) support. View active user sessions across all platforms and revoke permissions.</li>\n<li>Database Encryption - Backend stored as encrypted SQLite database files</li>\n<li>Data Export/Import - Export and import SSH hosts, credentials, and file manager data</li>\n<li>Automatic SSL Setup - Built-in SSL certificate generation and management with HTTPS redirects</li>\n<li>Modern UI - Clean desktop/mobile-friendly interface built with React, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn</li>\n<li>Languages - Built-in support for English, Chinese, German, and Portuguese</li>\n<li>Platform Support - Available as a web app, desktop application (Windows, Linux, and macOS), and dedicated mobile/tablet app for iOS and Android.</li>\n<li>SSH Tools - Create reusable command snippets that execute with a single click. Run one command simultaneously across multiple open terminals.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Before you comment, I am aware that server stats show the server as offline if you add a new host. It's already been fixed, but the release will be out within a week. Instead of commenting here for support, I highly recommend you open a <a href=\"https://github.com/Termix-SSH/Support/issues/new/choose\">GitHub Issue</a>.  </p>\n<p>Thanks for reading,<br />\nLuke</p><div><br></div><img src=\"https://i.redd.it/3juu7apv810g1.jpeg\" />",

            "title": "Selfhost Showoff Sunday! Here's my setup",
            "content_html": "<p>With a LOT of help and inspiration from this sub, I've gotten my selfhosted homelab into a place I really am happy with, and I wanted to show off what I've got running. Nearly all of this infrastructure is a bunch of Docker containers on a Lenovo T15 laptop running Linux Mint. I have a single \"stacks\" repo with the Docker compose configs, as well as <em>really</em> bad home-rolled shell scripts for updating of images and backing up of container configs and volumes.</p>\n<p>Below are all (I think?) of the pieces of my homelab. Would love to hear how others' Selfhost Setups are looking today!</p>\n<p>Infrastructure:\n- Nebula VPN: connects everything together, and allows me to access everything remotely. And uh I swear this is not a shill post! but disclaimer, I work at Defined Networking which provides a managed Nebula, so this is an easy setup for me personally. Otherwise Tailscale would've been a no-brainer.\n- Traefik / LetsEncrypt: everything's proxied thru Traefik and generates TLS certs with LE, using DNS verification via AWS Route53. All apps are tied to Traefik/LE using Docker compose labeling, which is great because I hate configuring Traefik and LetsEncrypt\n- Gitea: contains, among other things, my main \"stacks\" repo from which this whole setup is bootstrapped\n- Infisical: used for SSH key management/connectivity to my homelab hosts. Someday I will also use this for secrets management...\n- Pocket ID: auth I can add to non-authed apps. Exceptionally easy to setup, and works great with my YubiKey and phone biometrics\n- Beszel/Ntfy/Mattermost: monitoring/alerting of infrastructure, or \"we have Grafana/Prometheus at home\". Beszel has been a nice monitoring/alerting setup which publishes to both Ntfy (easy message routing and phone notifications) and Mattermost (easy logging)\n- Kuma Uptime: monitoring/alerting of apps/websites I care about: also publishes to Ntfy/Mattermost\n- Portainer: easy/quick at-a-glance view of my the Docker stacks. I could manage most all my Docker compose setups in here, but that's a whole other project, and would mean migrating away from my extremely bad shell scripts\n- Dockpeek: has mostly replaced my awful shell script that updates my Docker images\n- Speedtest Tracker: runs twice daily and outputs to Ntfy, mostly just fun to see how much more consistent my new internet is compared to my previous Comcast (lmao fuck Comcast)\n- AdGuard: great DNS blocking. I used to use PiHole, but I like managing AdGuard a little more\n- Syncthing: not shown, but vital to this setup: I have a Pepe Silvia web of Syncthing'd hosts, which handle all of my backups</p>\n<p>Selfhosted Things I Use A Lot:\n- Immich: I've completely migrated from Google Photos, having recently done an <code>immich-go</code> CLI import of my Google Takeout export\n- SearXNG: has completely replaced all my searching on both PC and mobile\n- Vaultwarden: has completely replaced my Bitwarden setup\n- n8n: houses my automation workflows, two main ones are my daily weather and daily news, where n8n scrapes some data, summarizes data with local AI (I'm lazy so I just use Ollama on my Windows gaming PC), and sends the daily reports to my \"Good Morning\" Mattermost channel\n- ownCloud Office/Collabora: this was a bit of a bitch to get set up, but has been a solid docs/sheets replacement\n- Karakeep: (ignore the totals, I've been mucking with my Karakeep data) excellent link saver, with local AI summarization (again, to my Ollama host)\n- Zipline: image hosting that I use mainly for the Homepage icons (for apps that are tougher to pull favicons from directly)\n- IT Tools/networking-toolbox: two excellent 'toolbox' apps that I use daily\n- jsoncrack: great json visualizer, especially for deeply-nested data\n- Grocy: we use this to catalog our chest freezer in the basement; it's sooo nice to know what we have down there at a glance\n- Homebox: where I document the things that I'd otherwise lose in our garage or basement storage\n- Memos/Beaver Habit Tracker: daily journal and habit tracking that has really assuaged my ADHD\n- Invoke/Open WebUI: for messing around with local AI. I do not have a big enough setup for this to be super super useful though :/\n- changedetection.io: great for easily keeping track of some blogs I care about, and tracking some news sites that I otherwise don't visit directly (eg HN/Slashdot)\n- MeTube: IMO the cleanest/easiest YouTube downloader\n- NocoDB: has mostly replaced the spreadsheets I was previously using as databases \ud83d\ude2c</p>\n<p>Cool Stuff I Don't Use As Much But By George I've Got It:\n- Home Assistant: I'm still in the early stages of getting our smarthome stuff set up. Don't judge\n- BentoPDF/Excalidraw: pretty cool local toolboxes\n- Netdata: very neat, granular host monitoring software, but it's a got a big footprint, and has a cloud connectivity requirement for logging in. I tried this out but Beszel mostly fulfills this\n- Proxmox: I have a physical Proxmox host (just another Lenovo laptop, heh), I just don't do much with it yet\n- HarborGuard: Docker image vulnerability scanning. Neat, but I didn't find the scans super actionable, so I don't really use it\n- Seafile: just got this after I saw others recommend it, not yet sure if it'll replace ownCloud for my filehosting\n- Slink: very slick \"we have imgur at home\", I currently only use it for the Homepage background of the Pillars of Creation</p><div><br></div><img src=\"https://i.redd.it/8dd3xctsm2wf1.png\" />",

            "title": "My Plex server has started an addiction",
            "content_html": "<p>It started about a month or two ago when I got a new OLED TV and wanted to make sure I was playing the highest quality content on it. I realized streaming services were absolutely terrible in terms of bitrate &amp; surround sound, so I got back into pirating.</p>\n<p>It started by me using my PC to run Plex, then I realized that was annoying, so I moved to my old laptop, but I quickly ran out of space there.. so I went back to the PC, added a few cheap nvme drives, and that worked fine for about a week.</p>\n<p>Then I ran out of space again, so I started buying some external HDD enclosures. I had 2 26TB HDDs running with StableBit Drivepool so I could have it as one drive. I added a third HDD so I could get parity. I realized those were slow (at least for the quick 100GB transfers of movie files/TV shows I needed) &amp; also a bad idea for safety (unplugging during writes can cause corruption). This also meant adding drives to the pool over time would not gracefully rebalance automatically. So I got a 9460i 16 raid card and began plugging the drives directly into the card (which is connected to the mobo).</p>\n<p>That was fine until one night I was working late and heard popcorn popping. I also noticed that my (fairly small) office was getting warmer than usual. It was the drives. At this point I 6 26TB HDDs that I was trying to store my media on. I couldn't deal with the sound &amp; the heat.</p>\n<p>I returned the drives, did a bunch more research, and realized I needed at least RAID6 if I was planning on having any real level of redundancy. So I purchased 4 16TB enterprise SAS SSDs off of eBay (used, but still 90-99% health left on them!!). These run quiet, cool, and are way smaller. I ran this off of my own PC for a bit but realized I hated that my torrenting VPN would cause issues with my work apps &amp; browsing. I had to decide between work or torrenting, and I do a lot of both so that got annoying quickly.</p>\n<p>What finally pushed me to get a dedicated rig was when my sister &amp; one of my friends both tried to watch something from my library at the same time and both had to transcode. They began stuttering &amp; buffering. I need great uptime because I really want this to be a dedicated reliable library of high quality ad-free movies &amp; shows.</p>\n<p>I built a custom (overkill - I might run something else on it some day) Plex PC running Windows 11 (I know, please don't kill me lol. I just wanted something that worked easily and didn't require a lot more time investment from me right now). I put a 7600X, 32GB, Arc B580, and the raid card + drives into the case and it was awesome.. for a day or two. It took me like a week of debugging to realize that it *had* to be set to PCIE3 speeds &amp; run off of a dedicated connection to the CPU (forgetting the proper name for this). Once I did that the drives stopped randomly going offline and it's been running reliably since (for about a week now). This morning I added 2 more 16TB ssds and with RAID6 I'm now at 83.7TB of drives. 55.8TB of usable capacity after 2 drive parity and 21TB of it used. One thing I could not figure out is how to wire things nicely in the N5 case with the SSDs. I managed to get 3 of them to appear in the front bottom of the case (second pic) but the other 3 are tucked in the back. There just wasn't long enough cabling to make things fit nicely in the bays, and the bays also would allow me to mount SAS, but no way to output anything beside SATA (as far as I can figure out).</p>\n<p>I know I've made a lot of mistakes and I'm probably still messing something up - but the moments where I can sit down on my couch and watch some 80Mbps 5.1/7.1 Blurays from a giant Plex library while seeing that my friends/family are doing the same make it totally worth it.</p>\n<p>I'm now looking for anyone who might be interested in helping test the rig out. I download things in the highest quality I can get and I'm constantly expanding, maybe 2-4TB of content per week. I don't have any dedicated system to request content (but you can ask me), nor can I guarantee uptime (but I'm trying to improve constantly). If you are interested in helping me test the rig out send me a DM with your Plex User/Email and I'll send you an invite. (P.S. I primarily have English audio tracks, sorry!)</p>\n<p>Happy to answer any questions or take any advice! Thanks for reading my word wall.</p>",

Consider Jellyfin.</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Full text below: \nhttps://i.imgur.com/0PMRvVY.png</p>\n<hr />\n<blockquote>\n<pre><code>Dear Plex User,\n\nWe have recently experienced a security incident that may potentially involve your Plex account information. We believe the actual impact of this incident is limited; however, action is required from you to ensure your account remains secure.\n\nWhat happened \nAn unauthorized third party accessed a limited subset of customer data from one of our databases. While we quickly contained the incident, information that was accessed included emails, usernames, and securely hashed passwords.\n\nAny account passwords that may have been accessed were securely hashed, in accordance with best practices, meaning they cannot be read by a third party. Out of an abundance of caution, we recommend you immediately reset your password by visiting https://plex.tv/reset. Rest assured that we do not store credit card data on our servers, so this information was not compromised in this incident.\n\nWhat we're doing \nWe've already addressed the method that this third party used to gain access to the system, and we're undergoing additional reviews to ensure that the security of all of our systems is further hardened to prevent future attacks.\n\nWhat you must do \nWe kindly request that you reset your Plex account password immediately by visiting https://plex.tv/reset. When doing so, there's a checkbox to \"Sign out connected devices after password change,\" which we recommend you enable. This will sign you out of all your devices (including any Plex Media Server you own) for your security, and you will then need to sign back in with your new password. We understand that this means a little more work for you, but it will provide additional security to your account.\n\nAdditional Security Measures \nYou Can Take We remind you that no one at Plex will ever reach out to you over email to ask for a password or credit card number for payments. For further account protection, we also recommend enabling two-factor authentication on your Plex account if you haven\u2019t already done so.\n\nLastly, we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this situation may cause you. We take pride in our security systems, which helped us quickly detect this incident, and we want to assure you that we are working swiftly to prevent potential future incidents from occurring.\n\nFor step-by-step instructions on how to reset your password, visit: https://support.plex.tv/articles/account-requires-password-reset\n\nThank you,\n\nThe Plex Team\n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>",

My dad is weird with tech in the sense he knows what he's talking about but also not really? He's a bit like an old man who thinks the computers are mythical beings and I need something to reassure him that hackers aren't going to get into our home cameras from my minecraft server. Which is nuts coming from a man who has only one password.</p>\n<p>I was just going to stick a whitelist on it and call it a day. That's what most people I know have done. I don't really want to spend any money, that's the whole reason I'm hosting it myself. I have looked into VLANs and ehhhhhh I don't want to fuck with those but also I can't on my router from my ISP anyway. I'm a little unsure where to go next. I don't really see much risk personally.

Sometimes he pretends to be unbiased by listing other services, but <strong>he always puts SMTPget first and hypes it up</strong>.</p>\n<p>In the past, his account made a random post in an Indian actor subreddit to seem neutral, which further confirms that he's the owner, because the SMTPget website itself has an Indian phone number.</p>\n<p>It's completely obvious he's the owner or directly part of the team.</p>\n<p><strong>SMTPget is a fake SMTP service with terrible reviews. According to all reviews, they don't deliver anything and just take your money. Their plans are all very expensive and the website is literally just a front to take money and not deliver anything!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>They don't even accept safe payments like PayPal or credit cards. They ONLY accept GIFT CARDS and Crypto. Very fitting for an Indian scammer indeed. \ud83e\udd23</strong></p>\n<p>Here's the Trustpilot page (<strong>EVERY REVIEW</strong> is 1-star explaining how his scam works, where people have lost $180, $1000 etc when they thought they bought a large capacity bulk mailing service but got nothing at all; there's only two fake 5-star reviews from Indian usernames):</p>\n<p>\ud83d\udc49 <a href=\"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/smtpget.com\">https://www.trustpilot.com/review/smtpget.com</a></p>\n<p>And here's another huge warning on Sitejabber:</p>\n<p>\ud83d\udc49 <a href=\"https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/smtpget.com\">https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/smtpget.com</a></p>\n<p>I've blocked him and reported him to the mods. His entire posting history is just pushing SMTPget. He adds no value to the community and <strong>should be banned, and his post history in selfhosted should be deleted to protect people.</strong></p>\n<p>My second reason for making this post is to give him some nice Google SEO results to perhaps warn some future victims.</p>",

B. No proper metadata yet. (details here:https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1l9jlhm/update_35_spotify_open_source_sonos_alternative/)</p>\n<p>Airplay1 &amp; 2: MacOs/iOS\nI added a second Airplay stream to the tutorial. What is pretty nice, is that things like youtube, tidal and all the stuff is working using airplay.\nBut also here: metadata is sometimes not standardized. I guess i will have to look into how snapcast handles the streams and maybe map some lost metadata, anyone experience with this?</p>\n<p>Stream Components\nAdded some components in the app to manage streams. (see picture 3)</p>\n<p>You can find the updated repo here (v.0.0.2):\nhttps://github.com/byrdsandbytes/snapcast-pi</p>\n<p>Thanks to the wonderful people, that say annoying things like, \u201eI am still utterly confused as to what is snapcast pi and what ist beatnik.\u201c, i have to think about, explain &amp; name things. So i made a graph. (First pic). What do you think? Does that help?</p>\n<p>Next steps are going to clean up the messy web app and make a first release. Any suggestions which license? (GPLv3, AGPLv3, or go full anarchy with MIT?)</p>\n<p>Note: the first release is not gone be well documented, full of bugs &amp; therefore not production ready. </p>\n<p>Thanks for asking questions &amp; staring on github.

Honestly, the concept is super cool, and I was really excited to use it and potentially contribute.</p>\n<p>But after looking into it, I realized the developer is putting key features behind a paywall (via Patreon) and has only released partial source code, saying \u201cthe open source parts\u201d are available \u2014 while keeping the rest closed.</p>\n<p>Since Sunshine is licensed under the GPLv3, this is very likely a license violation. The GPL requires that if you modify or build on a GPL-licensed project and distribute it (even behind a paywall), you must also release all of the modified code under the same GPL license.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve opened an issue on the DUO GitHub repo explaining this in detail and citing sources from the Free Software Foundation and the license itself:\n\ud83d\udc49 <a href=\"https://github.com/DuoStream/Duo/issues/294\">Here\u2019s the GitHub issue I filed</a></p>\n<p>I\u2019m not trying to attack the dev here \u2014 I know maintaining projects is hard work, and DUO clearly took effort. But I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s right to build on open source work and then close off large parts of the result. That\u2019s not how open source works, and it goes against the license that allowed this kind of innovation in the first place.</p>\n<p>If anyone else is concerned or can offer insight (especially if you\u2019ve dealt with GPL enforcement before), feel free to chime in on the issue or raise visibility. Hopefully with enough attention the developer will bring the project into compliance.</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>",

It's just frustrating when I setup a project, and then learn that half of the features are \"unavailable\" because I'm not a \"paying subscriber\" and I have to try something else.  </p>\n<p>For example; Defguard, multi-site, user count, etc.</p>\n<p>I'd want to connect: my home, parents' house, and a server I rent in a DC.</p>\n<p>Well, then I'd have to pay 179 eur (\\~$200USD) PER MONTH to have that feature. And the best part, they don't offer month-to-moth subscription options, so I'd have to pay $2,409 USD! </p>\n<p>That's JUST AS BAD as a professional solution offered by any other major player in the network space!</p>\n<p>They're not the only folks doing this; Rustdesk does it too, same song and dance, no monthly options, and all of the nicer features are locked behind a paywall. Kasm also does the same with branding, and connection limits. (5 is NOT enough for small teams!)</p>\n<p>I get it you want to make some money, I really do, but companies should really explore other avenues. Wireguard gets it right, they let individuals enjoy all the features the platform has to offer, and then hope they bring it to their company.</p>\n<p>I've had to go OUT OF MY WAY to find solutions to issues like this; i.e. searching for other developers liking a product so much that they develop a custom backend by reverse engineering the original software's backend. (Great example of this is Rustdesk-API! Someone reverse engineered the backend, and built their own that works great!) <a href=\"https://github.com/lejianwen/rustdesk-api\">https://github.com/lejianwen/rustdesk-api</a></p>\n<p>The point of selfhosted is to\u00a0<strong>NOT</strong>\u00a0rely on a subscription, the idea is to host whatever it is that's being offered onsite, with no cost, and with community support. That's the r/selfhosted that I'm happy to see, play with, and learn. Whatever this mess is that's been slowly creeping up on the subreddit has really been getting out of hand.</p>\n<p>There are exclusions, we all pay the \"Plex Tax\" but I have a feeling that's about to go south based on their recent changes, and some folk pay for solutions like UNRAID or HexOS, which I get, but they're entirely paywalled, because they're complete solutions.</p>",

At risk of sounding cliche - we listened intently to the community feedback and have decided that we needed to change our approach with the Professional Edition of Pangolin:</p>\n<p><strong>All features will always be available in BOTH the Community and Professional Edition of Pangolin under a typical dual-license model (more info below).</strong></p>\n<p>This means that IdP user auto-provisioning  and the integration API (with its API keys and scoped permissions) are now available to everyone in 1.4.0!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/fosrl/pangolin\">https://github.com/fosrl/pangolin</a> </li>\n<li>Docs: <a href=\"https://docs.fossorial.io/\">https://docs.fossorial.io/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Auto-Provision IdP Users</h1>\n<p>Auto provisioning is a feature that allows you to automatically create and manage user accounts in Pangolin when they log in using an external identity provider. This is useful for organizations that want to streamline the onboarding process for new users and ensure that their user accounts are always up-to-date. You are able to programmatically decide the roles and organizations for new users based on the information provided by the identity provider</p>\n<h1>Integration API</h1>\n<p>The integration API is a well documented way to interact with and script Pangolin. It is a REST API that has support for all different operations you can do with the UI. It has easy scoped permissions so you can create keys with specific jobs. You can see the different routes here: <a href=\"https://docs.fossorial.io/Pangolin/API/integration-api\">https://docs.fossorial.io/Pangolin/API/integration-api</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/5wvflhb1ik0f1.png?width=4544&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce65dac749a5c3436a7e2ffbaa0de38db204357c\">Swagger UI docs for Pangolin Integration API.</a></p>\n<h1>Dual License Model</h1>\n<p>Pangolin is dual licensed under AGPL-3.0 and the Fossorial Commercial License. Both the \u201cCommunity Edition\u201d and \u201cProfessional Edition\u201d will have feature parity. The supporter program is for individual enthusiasts, tinkerers, and homelabbers. This won't go away and we don't expect supporters to go Professional. The Professional Edition will remain - but for businesses who need our support and more flexibility. We expect businesses to pay for a version of Pangolin. We may adjust the pricing as we learn more about what companies want.</p>\n<p>Monetizing is new territory for us, and we are learning as we go. We appreciate your patience and we hope that this is a better approach for our community.</p>",

We plan to expand with native support for other platforms over time, as well as continue to bolster and add new authentication and access control tooling. See more in our <a href=\"https://docs.fossorial.io/Pangolin/Identity%20Providers/configuring-identity-providers\">docs</a></p>\n<p>Our focus is to make it easier to plug Pangolin into whatever ecosystem you\u2019re already using.</p>\n<p><strong>UI Refresh</strong></p>\n<p>Alongside that, we\u2019ve also launched a refreshed UI.

And a special thank you to those who have supported the project financially through the Supporter Program.</p>\n<p>We also want to share that we\u2019ve introduced a new Professional Edition license. This is primarily aimed at businesses using Pangolin in production or commercial environments and provides access to some extra features and primarily dedicated support from us. This change helps us more predictably fund continued development and long-term maintenance of the project.

Since the legal process is still unresolved, I\u2019ll have to save the full story for another time. For now, I\u2019ve decided that the best path forward is to rebrand.</p>\n<p>Starting today, Hoarder is rebranding to Karakeep! </p>\n<p>The name Karakeep is inspired by the Arabic word \"\u0643\u0631\u0627\u0643\u064a\u0628\" (karakeeb), a colloquial term commonly used to refer to miscellaneous clutter, odds and ends, or items that may seem disorganized but often hold personal value or hidden usefulness. It evokes the image of a messy drawer or forgotten box, full of stuff you can't quite throw away\u2014because somehow, it matters (or more likely, because you're a hoarder!).</p>\n<p>Over the next couple of weeks, things will start getting renamed to Karakeep (the repo, apps, extensions, etc). <a href=\"https://hoarder.app\">hoarder.app</a> will soon also begin redirecting to our new domain: <a href=\"https://karakeep.app\">karakeep.app</a>.</p>\n<p>I took pride in coming up with \"hoarder\" as the name for the project. I've spent months searching for a different name, but nothing felt as good as hoarder was. But it's time to move on. I'm incredibly grateful for the support this community has shown throughout the whole thing. Hopefully, I can now focus my time and energy on what matters: building Karakeep.</p>\n<p>It goes without saying, but please refrain from contacting the other party in any way, shape, or form.</p>",
