But then, I stumbled upon \"selfhosted\" by accident while researching a different app, which led me to the world of open-source software \u2013 something I had no prior knowledge of. When I realized I had to set up a server, I was in for a surprise.</p>\n<p>A kind soul directed me to the \"selfhosted\" subreddit. Spending an entire evening there opened my eyes to a world of possibilities I never knew existed. I had no idea you could do this. The reality hit me hard \u2013 I wasn't as smart as I thought.</p>\n<p>For the next four days, I immersed myself in learning how to host my own media server. It was challenging, especially since I'm not a programmer and had zero knowledge about dockers or containers. ChatGPT became my ally, helping me understand complex concepts in simple terms.</p>\n<p>Last night, I successfully set up my media server on an old gaming laptop using Jellyfin, Sonarr, Radarr, Requestrr, Jackett, and Heimdall. I'm absolutely delighted, especially with Requestrr, which makes my life so much easier.</p>\n<p>Now, I'm eager to explore self-hosting even further by setting up a music library, ebooks, photos, videos, a password manager, and more. I've come across options like Lidarr for music and Readarr for books, but I'd love to hear your recommendations.</p>\n<p>Is there a way to use a similar server setup like Sonarr for managing music and ebooks? I've tried Openbooks and Kavita, but Openbooks was a pain to set up and Kavita seems to be a library manager without a download option. Can you recommend something that I can download and use offline on my mobile for music and ebooks please?</p>\n<p>On a special note, I want to express my heartfelt thanks to everyone who's been patient and supportive, especially those who answered challenging questions in the subreddit. You're all truly amazing, and your guidance means the world to me. A big shoutout to all of you!</p>\n<p>People like you are rare, and you deserve all the good things in life.</p>",

This is what you get:</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Full mesh VPN with P2P</li>\n<li>Complete UI to manage your network and devices</li>\n<li>The UI includes letting your users manage their own devices</li>\n<li>An internal DNS with Adblock list, custom entries and  DNSSEC (think pihole + unbound)</li>\n<li>A basic client application</li>\n<li>An integration to the reverse proxy (to secure your servapps easily)</li>\n<li>Multi-server setup (to bypass CGNAT or access isolated private servers)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/c7uwhj0fsysb1.png?width=981&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c6980dcec992a6ed9c5eac84a1678223976fe98f\">Secure your URLs in one click!</a></p>\n<p>Constellation itself is based on Nebula but build upon it, and will continue to do so. Some of the planned features for Constellation are</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Exit Nodes</li>\n<li>Internal Firewalls</li>\n<li>Probably some container interactions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>I am still actively working on the client applications, for now only Android and Windows are available but the other ones will follow up soon!</p>\n<h1>Why would you use Constellation rather than alternatives like Cloudflare Tunnel or Tailscale?</h1>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Cloudflare Tunnel is <strong>not</strong> a very good practice for security: first of all it leaves your origin server in your local network unprotected, and it also let CLoudflare see all your decrypted network. Tailscale is a better alternative, but not quite in the \"self-hosted\" philosophy as it relies on distant cloud servers. Now the closest thing you will get to what Constellation does, is something like OpenZiti. What Constellation offers you on top of it is the integration to the reverse proxy and the automatic DNS. </p>\n<p>For example, one of the big issues of VPN setups is \"how to tunnel my stuff\". You have multiple choices: Tunnel everything (but then it impact your everyday browsing). Have 2 sets of domains, or manually maintain a DNS with overwrites (both being annoying to do). Instead, Constellation automatically rewrite all your reverse proxy URLs on the fly to be tunneled through the VPN. It is also a full split tunnel so you can leave it on at all time.</p>\n<p>Why would you <strong>not</strong> choose Constellation?</p>\n<p>The three main reasons would be: The application might not be available yet for your platform, you don't want to self-host the discovery server (in case you need one, ex. for CGNAT), or you need the exit node functionality (aka. proxy all your network through the server. No ETA on this feature for now).</p>\n<p>Aside from this, few improvement to this version, here's the full changelog:</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Added Constellation</li>\n<li>DNS Challenge is now used for all certificates when enabled [breaking change]</li>\n<li>Rework headers for better compatibility</li>\n<li>Improve experience for non-admin users</li>\n<li>Fix bug with redirect on logout</li>\n<li>Added OverwriteHostHeader to routes to override the host header sent to the target app</li>\n<li>Added WhitelistInboundIPs to routes to  filter incoming requests based on IP per URL</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>It's good \"to be back\" from this adventure, as I have been pretty low-profile while this was taking a lot of my time, hope you enjoy the update!</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>",

It was a trip with many emotions. As I've grown older, my parents are getting older as well. Browsing photos of them just a few years back struck me again that all we will ever carry with us are memories. This realization has given me an even stronger sense of responsibility to preserve the memories in the family so that it is accessible to my family member from the past to the future generation so that the grandchild of my kid will know how lovely their great-great-grandparents were. </p>\n<p>While I was gone, the team took the development task autonomously with little of my participation. This made me very happy, as the project is now in the good hands of the contributors. My role recently has been focused on testing, QA, deployment, bug fixes, and small development tasks.</p>\n<p>I am looking forward to getting back into developing more significant features in the coming months. </p>\n<p>Within the last three months, Immich has gone from version <strong>1.71</strong> to <strong>1.81</strong> with many new features and improvements. I am happy to give you some recaps of the new features highlighted below.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Support for external libraries </li>\n<li>Video hardware transcoding</li>\n<li>Manually upload photos and video on the mobile app</li>\n<li>Optimizing views on most pages on the web</li>\n<li>UI/UX improvement for facial recognition actions</li>\n<li>Slideshow mode on the web</li>\n<li>Map view on mobile app</li>\n<li>Better settings configuration</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Support for external libraries</h1>\n<p>This feature was one of the community's first and most requested features. We had lengthy <a href=\"https://github.com/immich-app/immich/discussions/1006\">discussions</a>, some very heated because the feature was deemed as not the original goal of Immich, which served as a backup solution. Immich, since then, has evolved to be an excellent application to not only backup but also to browse and manage your memories. </p>\n<p>The community and contributors then took this feature into their own hands and implemented it. The work was completed in around 2 months with much development and testing effort from the contributors and helpful community members. I appreciate you all.</p>\n<p>You can now mount external libraries for different users to the container and have Immich scan them to display in the instance. All of Immich's goodies are accessible for photos and videos in the library. Please visit our <a href=\"https://immich.app/docs/features/libraries\">official documentation</a> for more information on how to use this feature.</p>\n<h1>Video hardware transcoding</h1>\n<p>You can now utilize hardware acceleration through supported CPUs or GPUs to transcode video faster and offload the work from hogging up the CPU. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/bhv4e5qybfsb1.png?width=1274&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99aaf27e16d0343de344504269a9153aaa72ff05\">Hardware acceleration settings</a></p>\n<h1>Slideshow mode on the web</h1>\n<p>This is the first iteration of the slideshow mode as an effort to get my children to sit still and look through the photos instead of watching Blippi. It is now only available on the web, and I plan to add it to the mobile app.</p>\n<h1>Map view on mobile app</h1>\n<p>You can see the location of your photos and videos on the map. This is a great way to see where your memories are located and where the events were happening.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/z57baddsbfsb1.png?width=761&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=667ccb0684837f480302b63fac0c5839ebe2280e\">Map view on mobile app</a></p>\n<h1>Better settings configuration</h1>\n<p>We have moved most configurable settings from the `.env` file to the admin interface. We also add the ability to create a config file to deploy new instances automatically. This will help many automation cases and assist folks who run hosting services with Immich as an option.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/3rn0rfd2cfsb1.png?width=1404&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=833be674fd3509e241fe2bcf7fb252c5a8422966\">Instance's settings page</a></p>\n<p>A lot of work is still planned for Immich to make it more resilient, better performance, and easier for you and the community. We hope Immich has helped you store, view, and manage your memory in an enjoyable way.</p>\n<p>I hope to work on Immich full-time one day; your donation makes a difference and will help me reach that goal quickly. </p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>As always, thank you for using Immich, and I hope you enjoy this update.</p>\n<p>Remember to support the project!</p>\n<p>If you find the project helpful and it helps you in some ways, you can support the project\u00a0<a href=\"https://github.com/sponsors/alextran1502?frequency=one-time&amp;sponsor=alextran1502\">one time</a>\u00a0or\u00a0<a href=\"https://github.com/sponsors/alextran1502\">monthly</a>\u00a0from GitHub Sponsors.</p>\n<p>Join our friendly\u00a0<a href=\"https://discord.gg/D8JsnBEuKb\">Discord</a> for discussion and to get help!</p>\n<p>\ud83c\udf89 Cheer! \ud83c\udf89</p>\n<p>Alex</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>",

Unless you have a whole DevOps team, it usually brings more problems than benefits, and unnecessary infrastructure bills buried a lot of startups before they got anywhere.</p>\n<p>As for prerequisites, you can't be a complete beginner in the world of computers. If you've never even heard of Docker, if you don't know at least something about DNS, or if you don't have any experience with Linux, this course is probably not for you. That being said, I do explain the basics too, but probably not in enough detail for a complete beginner.</p>\n<p>Here's a 100% OFF coupon if you want to check it out:</p>\n<p>https://www.udemy.com/course/real-world-devops-project-from-start-to-finish/?couponCode=FREEDEVOPS2310JMGQA</p>\n<p>Be sure to BUY the course for $0, and not sign up for Udemy's subscription plan. The Subscription plan is selected by default, but you want the BUY checkbox. If you see a price other than $0, chances are that all coupons have been used already.\nYou can try manually entering the coupon code because Udemy sometimes messes with the link.</p>\n<p>The accompanying files for the course are at https://github.com/predmijat/realworlddevopscourse</p>\n<p>I encourage you to watch \"free preview\" videos to get the sense of what will be covered, but here's the gist:</p>\n<p>The goal of the course is to create an easily deployable and reproducible server which will have \"everything\" a startup or a small company will need - VPN, mail, Git, CI/CD, messaging, hosting websites and services, sharing files, calendar, etc. It can also be useful to individuals who want to self-host all of those - I ditched Google 99.9% and other than that being a good feeling, I'm not worried that some AI bug will lock my account with no one to talk to about resolving the issue.</p>\n<p>Considering that it covers a wide variety of topics, it doesn't go in depth in any of those. Think of it as going down a highway towards the end destination, but on the way there I show you all the junctions where I think it's useful to do more research on the subject.</p>\n<p>We'll deploy services inside Docker and LXC (Linux Containers). Those will include a mail server (iRedMail), Zulip (Slack and Microsoft Teams alternative), GitLab (with GitLab Runner and CI/CD), Nextcloud (file sharing, calendar, contacts, etc.), checkmk (monitoring solution), Pi-hole (ad blocking on DNS level), Traefik with Docker and file providers (a single HTTP/S entry point with automatic routing and TLS certificates).</p>\n<p>We'll set up WireGuard, a modern and fast VPN solution for secure access to VPS' internal network, and I'll also show you how to get a wildcard TLS certificate with certbot and DNS provider.</p>\n<p>To wrap it all up, we'll write a simple Python application that will compare a list of the desired backups with the list of finished backups, and send a result to a Zulip stream. We'll write the application, do a 'git push' to GitLab which will trigger a CI/CD pipeline that will build a Docker image, push it to a private registry, and then, with the help of the GitLab runner, run it on the VPS and post a result to a Zulip stream with a webhook.</p>\n<p>When done, you'll be equipped to add additional services suited for your needs.</p>\n<p>If this doesn't appeal to you, please leave the coupon for the next guy :)</p>\n<p>I hope that you'll find it useful!</p>\n<p>Happy learning,\nPredrag</p>",

You can use it to access files on a server or a NAS in an easy and secure way.</p>\n<p>I've posted about Orb a few times in the past, but this time it's about the v1.0 release. With this release, I consider this project more or less done. That doesn't mean that there will be no more new releases, but for now I will focus more on <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/hsleisink/cauldron\">another open source project</a> that I'm working on.</p>\n<p>Orb was created to have a user friendly web interface to access my files on my server. A friend of mine runs it on a Raspberry Pi to access the files on his NAS at home while he's at work. The explorer application is therefore the most important application. It also allows you to share files or directories with other people. File viewers for PDF, Word and Excel files, text files, images, videos and ZIP files make it all more user friendly. But this wouldn't be a hobby project if I didn't some fun stuff. So, there is of course minesweeper, a DOS and C64 emulator and last but not least, Wolfenstein 3D! And yes, it's a nerd project, so it has a terminal.</p>\n<p>Download Orb from <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/hsleisink/orb/\">Gitlab</a> or give the <a href=\"https://desktop.leisink.net/\">demo account</a> a try. Have fun with it!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/8nnlk8t0ujrb1.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=30caa3e9d311ff8d0aff00f3f4cd6b7748a032f5\">Orb screenshot</a></p></div>",

I have this data backed up on an external HD that I keep at my moms house. </p>\n<p>Since I built my server a couple years ago, I mostly have been using my phone for photos and not a camera. I use google photos to back this up, my wife uses icloud. I want to implement immich and have us both move away from our respective back up solutions. I also want to pay for one 'cloud' back up solution to back up all of my configs plus our personal photos/videos (no interest in backing up my media, I don't have anything rare/hard to replace).    </p>\n<p>Is immich a good choice? Can it take and organize my existing 3 tb of data? Is there a better option than Immich plus Duplicacy for my use case?  </p>\n<p>I will add that I am pretty much a noob and can't problem solve too much on my own, my server was built almost solely by following ibracorp and spaceinvader tutorials. </p></div>",

I am looking to utilise a script to backup all the different databases housed inside my MariaDB instance . I came across Christian Lempa video of backing up linux servers (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoA6Bezgk1c\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoA6Bezgk1c</a>) and he provides a script in his video notes, which can be found here (<a href=\"https://github.com/ChristianLempa/scripts/blob/main/db-container-backup/db-container-backup.sh\">https://github.com/ChristianLempa/scripts/blob/main/db-container-backup/db-container-backup.sh</a>). But being a noob, I want to clarify if this script is saving all my mariadb databases for the various docker containers I am running. This line ( CONTAINER=$(docker ps --format '{{.Names}}:{{.Image}}' | grep 'mysql\\|mariadb' | cut -d\":\" -f1)  to me looks like its using docker command PS to list running containers with the name mysql or mariadb. I am running multiple docker containers that have mysql databases like Wallabag, tandoor, authelia, etc. Should I list out every container that has mysql database, so this script can backup those databases too or is this script backing up mysql and therefore all my databases that are housed inside mariadb instance? Apologies for what I am sure is making me sound like I should have no business self hosting lol but I am learning as I go. Thank you for any assistance :)   </p></div>",

I've been looking into things like Unraid and TrueNAS and finally decided to give it a go. </p>\n<p>Got rid of Proxmox and went for TrueNAS instead, and... really, really hated it. Mind you, I went for TrueNAS Core instead of Scale, and I imagine I'd enjoy the latter more, but I've only got the one data drive for now which TrueNAS Scale says is below the minimum requirements.</p>\n<p>I think the main problem was how TrueNAS handled VMs, I couldn't bloody well figure out how things worked. I've done a cert in networking where we did some generalised virtualisation and sysadmin work in VMware which is really easy to use, but when trying to spin up a simple Debian VM, i noticed there were a bunch of hacky workarounds that were required to get me going.</p>\n<p>So, what did I end up going with in the end? Back on Proxmox? Did I pay for Unraid? Well... back in the day, I had Ubuntu server running off an old laptop of mine that mostly hosted Docker containers. There were a few things it ran baremetal, but for me I really enjoyed doing everything through Docker Compose and using Webmin.</p>\n<p>I've gone back to this setup full time and I don't see myself changing any time soon. For me, this is what works. Nothing super flashy, just plain old Ubuntu and some Docker containers. I'm gonna go and set up YAMS now :) Wish me luck!</p></div>",

As you may or may not have heard, a recent <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/\"><strong>Reddit policy change</strong></a> threatens to kill many beloved third-party mobile apps (<strong><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/13wxepd/rif_dev_here_reddits_api_changes_will_likely_kill/\">Reddit is Fun</a>, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/getnarwhal/comments/13wv038/reddit_have_quoted_the_apollo_devs_a_ridiculous/jmdqtyt/\">Narwhal</a>, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/baconreader/comments/13wveb2/reddit_api_changes_and_baconreader/\">BaconReader</a></strong>, and many more), making a various features not seen in the official mobile app permanently inaccessible to users. Starting on July 1st, Reddit has unilaterally decided to impose exorbitant charges on third-party app developers for utilizing their API. This includes the developer for <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/\"><strong>Apollo</strong></a>, being charged <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/\"><strong>1.7 million dollars per month</strong></a> for API requests.</p>\n<p>On June 12th, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1401qw5/incomplete_and_growing_list_of_participating/\"><strong>many subreddits</strong></a> will be <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1412ee8/what_going_dark_means_going_private_is_discouraged/\"><strong>going dark</strong></a> in protest of this policy change. Some will return after 48 hours; others will go away permanently unless the issue is adequately addressed. </p>\n<p><strong>/r/selfhosted</strong> is planning on joining these subreddits in solidarity, requesting that Reddit revisit this policy change. 3rd party applications have been the lifeblood of Reddit for the past 10+ years and should be here in the future.</p>\n<p><strong>What can you do?</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Complain.</strong> Message the mods of /r/reddit.com, who are the admins of the site, and comment in relevant threads on /r/reddit, such as <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/\">this one</a>, leave a negative review on their official iOS or Android app- and sign your username in support.</li>\n<li><strong>Spread the word.</strong> Rabble-rouse on related subreddits. Meme it up, make it spicy.</li>\n<li><strong>Boycott</strong> and spread the word to Reddit's competition! Stay off Reddit entirely from June 12th through the 13th- instead, maybe touch some grass, call your grandma, or go install that new app you've been dying to try.</li>\n<li><strong>Don't be a jerk.</strong> As upsetting as this may be, threats, profanity, and vandalism will be worse than useless in getting people on our side. Please make every effort to be as restrained, polite, reasonable, and law-abiding as possible.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Here are some helpful links on the topic:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/\">The official announcement from Reddit</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/13xh1e7/an_open_letter_on_the_state_of_affairs_regarding/\">An Open Letter from /r/ModCoord</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/zqptto18e34b1.jpg\">A helpful infographic on the topic</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/wiki/index\">A list of participating subreddits</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/5/23749188/reddit-subreddit-private-protest-api-changes-apollo-charges\">The Verge article on the subject</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Additional Info for /r/selfhosted</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>/r/datahoarder is orchestrating a joint effort in archiving Reddit.

I'm sure some of you have already heard about it, and I've seen posts of Lemmy(ers?) posting that everyone neeeeeeds to switch immediately.  I don't want to be one of those posters.</p>\n<h2>Why would we want an alternative?</h2>\n<p>I won't go into all of the details here, as there are now dozens of posts, but essentially Reddit is killing off 3rd party apps with extremely high pricing to access their data.  To most of us who have been with Reddit for years, this is just the latest in a long line of things Reddit has changed about the site to be more appealing to Wall Street.  I don't want to argue here if the sky is falling or if people should or shouldn't be leaving Reddit, I'm simply here showing an alternative I think has promise.</p>\n<p>Links if you do want to find out more of what's happening</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/\">Apollo Developer explaining how it will effect his one app</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/13xh1e7/an_open_letter_on_the_state_of_affairs_regarding/\">Mod post on how these changes will effect their communities</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ypwgu1BpaO0\">Hour long interview with Apollo Dev for more detail</a></p>\n<h2>What is it?</h2>\n<p>Lemmy is a \"federated\" Reddit alternative.  Meaning there is no \"center\" server, servers interconnect to bring content to users.  If you use Mastadon, it's exactly like Mastadon.  I view it like Discord, where there are many servers (they call them instances) and inside those servers are different communities.  You can belong to a memes community on one server and another server.  The difference is these communities are in a Reddit forum format, and you pick your own home screen, meaning you can subscribe to communities from other servers.</p>\n<p>Long story short, you can subscribe to as many communities (subreddits) as you want from wherever you are.</p>\n<p>The downside is that it's confusing as hell to wrap your head around, and for most users it requires explaning.  The developers know this, Mastadon had to release a special wizard to help people join, and I think Lemmy will need to do something similar.</p>\n<p>So essentially, there are communities (analogous to subreddits) that live on instances (analogous to servers).  People can sign up for any instance they want, and subscribe not only communities on that instance, but any Lemmy instance.  To me, that's pretty neat, albeit complicated.</p>\n<h4>Pros so far:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The community is extremely nice so far, it feels like using Reddit back in the early 2010s.  No karma farming, cat pictures are actually just pictures of cats, memes are fun, people seem genuinely happy to be there</li>\n<li>Work is being done to improve it actively, new features are on the board and work is being done consistently</li>\n<li>Federated is a cool thing, there's no corporate governance to decide what is okay or not (more in cons)</li>\n<li>It's honestly the best alternative I've seen so far</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Cons so far:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>As mentioned it's confusing just getting started.  This is the number 1 complaint I read about it, and it is.  Sounds like the devs hear this and are challenging themselves to get an easier onboarding process up and running.</li>\n<li>The reason for this post, second biggest complaint, missing niche communities.  I'm hoping some people here help resolve this issue</li>\n<li>Not easy to share communities.  Once created, instance owners have to do quite a bit of evangelizing.  There's join-lemmy.org where if you have an instance, an icon, and a banner image it will start showing, but beyond that you have to post about your instance in relevant existing communities that you exist, and get people to join.</li>\n<li>It's very early.  The apps are pretty bare bones, it's in it's infancy.  I think it's growing though, and  I think this will change, but there's definitely been a few bugs I've had to deal with.</li>\n<li>Alt-right/Alt-left instances.  Downside of being federated, anyone can create an instance.  There are already some fringe communities.  You do have power to block them from your instance though, but they're offputting when you first get there, it takes a bit to subscribe to communities and block out the ones that are... out there.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Sure, but how does SelfHosted come in?</h2>\n<p>Since Lemmy is \"federated\", these instances come from separate servers.  One thing I see about Lemmy right now is that there are a lot of \"general\" instances, each with a memes community, a movies, music, whatever, but there aren't a lot of the specific communities that brought people to Reddit.  Woodworking, Trees, Art, those niche communities we all love are missing because there is not a critical mass of people.</p>\n<p>This is where selfhosting comes in.  Those communities don't fit well on other instances because those instances are busy managing their own communities.  For example, there are several gaming communities, but there are no specific communities for specific games.  No Call of Duty, no Mass Effect, no Witcher, etc.  Someone could run an RPG specific instance and run a bunch of specific RPG communities.  Same with any other genre.</p>\n<p>This is where I see Lemmy headed, most people join the larger instances, but then bring in communities they care about.</p>\n<h2>What's it like running an instance?</h2>\n<p>Right now most communities there are very tiny, my personal instance has about 10 people on it.  That is quite different from the subreddit alternative, but I see that as a positive personally.  I'm hoping to grow my fledgling community into something neat.</p>\n<p>If the hammer falls I see a mild migration to Lemmy.  I don't think it'll be like the Digg migration, but I think there could be many users who give up on Reddit and I want them to have a stable landing place.  Communities I've come to love I want to be able to say \"Hey, I'm over here now, you're welcome to join me.\"  </p>\n<p>There are several million 3rd party app users who access Reddit through 3rd party apps.  If only 10% of them decide to switch to an alternative once they are no longer able to access Reddit, that means a couple hundred thousand people will be looking for new homes.  I think we have an opportunity to provide them.</p>\n<p>I'm coming up on character limit, so if anyone is interested - the only requirements are a domain name and a host.  Everything is dockerized, and I'm happy to share my docker compose with anyone.  I followed the guide <a href=\"https://join-lemmy.org/docs/en/administration/install_docker.html\">here</a> but there were a lot of bumps and bruises along the way.  I'm happy to share what I learned.</p>\n<p>Anyway, thanks for reading all this way.  I recognize this may not be for everyone, but if you ever wanted to run your own community, now is your chance!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy\">GitHub Project</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://join-lemmy.org/docs/en/administration/install_docker.html\">Installation Guide</a></p>\n<p>Edit: Lots of formatting</p></div>",

Unless you have a whole DevOps team, it usually brings more problems than benefits, and unnecessary infrastructure bills buried a lot of startups before they got anywhere.</p>\n<p>As for prerequisites, you can't be a complete beginner in the world of computers. If you've never even heard of Docker, if you don't know at least something about DNS, or if you don't have any experience with Linux, this course is probably not for you. That being said, I do explain the basics too, but probably not in enough detail for a complete beginner.</p>\n<p>Here's a 100% OFF coupon if you want to check it out:</p>\n<p>~~https://www.udemy.com/course/real-world-devops-project-from-start-to-finish/?couponCode=FREEDEVOPS2306JEOZX~~</p>\n<p>Edit: All gone! Check back next month.</p>\n<p>Be sure to BUY the course for $0, and not sign up for Udemy's subscription plan. The Subscription plan is selected by default, but you want the BUY checkbox. If you see a price other than $0, chances are that all coupons have been used already.\nYou can try manually entering the coupon code because Udemy sometimes messes with the link.</p>\n<p>The accompanying files for the course are at https://github.com/predmijat/realworlddevopscourse</p>\n<p>I encourage you to watch \"free preview\" videos to get the sense of what will be covered, but here's the gist:</p>\n<p>The goal of the course is to create an easily deployable and reproducible server which will have \"everything\" a startup or a small company will need - VPN, mail, Git, CI/CD, messaging, hosting websites and services, sharing files, calendar, etc. It can also be useful to individuals who want to self-host all of those - I ditched Google 99.9% and other than that being a good feeling, I'm not worried that some AI bug will lock my account with no one to talk to about resolving the issue.</p>\n<p>Considering that it covers a wide variety of topics, it doesn't go in depth in any of those. Think of it as going down a highway towards the end destination, but on the way there I show you all the junctions where I think it's useful to do more research on the subject.</p>\n<p>We'll deploy services inside Docker and LXC (Linux Containers). Those will include a mail server (iRedMail), Zulip (Slack and Microsoft Teams alternative), GitLab (with GitLab Runner and CI/CD), Nextcloud (file sharing, calendar, contacts, etc.), checkmk (monitoring solution), Pi-hole (ad blocking on DNS level), Traefik with Docker and file providers (a single HTTP/S entry point with automatic routing and TLS certificates).</p>\n<p>We'll set up WireGuard, a modern and fast VPN solution for secure access to VPS' internal network, and I'll also show you how to get a wildcard TLS certificate with certbot and DNS provider.</p>\n<p>To wrap it all up, we'll write a simple Python application that will compare a list of the desired backups with the list of finished backups, and send a result to a Zulip stream. We'll write the application, do a 'git push' to GitLab which will trigger a CI/CD pipeline that will build a Docker image, push it to a private registry, and then, with the help of the GitLab runner, run it on the VPS and post a result to a Zulip stream with a webhook.</p>\n<p>When done, you'll be equipped to add additional services suited for your needs.</p>\n<p>If this doesn't appeal to you, please leave the coupon for the next guy :)</p>\n<p>I hope that you'll find it useful!</p>\n<p>Happy learning,\nPredrag</p></div>",

I had no idea too. There are no hacks or undocumented stuff involved. I\u2019ve been paying for the 50GB storage option because it\u2019s only $1 a month and makes switching between iOS devices so easy and convenient. I have also been paying for mailbox.org for years. This year mailbox.org raised their prices from $1 to $3 a month and included a bunch of additional online meeting, docs, etc services that I have no use for. While I understand the need to keep up with inflation and everything, I\u2019m a very light email user. I have maybe 700MBs in total in my email account, and send maybe a dozen emails a month. I started shopping around for a mailbox alternative when I learned that I could already cover this with my iCloud+ subscription (https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201238) and my mind was blown. </p>\n<p>I used to use fastmail before mailbox.org, and the process for updating DNS was always straightforward, but manual. You just go through their docs, copy/paste a couple of stuff, and you\u2019re good. iCloud honestly took it to another level for me. It asked if I want an automated setup, I said sure, it asked for my domain, figured out it was from cloudflare, poped up a cloudflare SSO I\u2019ve never seen before, then proposed a bunch of changes to my DNS records that I approved, and everything was done. </p>\n<p>Anyway, just thought I\u2019d post about this here in case anyone was interested. I searched this sub for iCloud, and didn\u2019t find a similar post so excuse me if it\u2019s a duplicate.</p></div>",

I know I missed last month's update. Work has been busy, and so has the Immich team. We have been brewing some big features over the last two months, and I want to finish everything before making the progress update post. </p>\n<p>So here are a few things that have been added to Immich recently. I hope you like those features as much as we do!</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Facial Recognition</li>\n<li>Partner Sharing</li>\n<li>Global Map View</li>\n<li>Responsive Web Interface</li>\n<li>Archiving</li>\n<li>Searchable description</li>\n<li>Managing login sessions</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>FACIAL RECOGNITION</h1>\n<p>Immich can now detect faces and group (cluster) similar faces together. You can view all the photos/videos that contain the person by clicking on the person, and you can search the assets with the person after naming them.</p>\n<p>This is our first iteration of the feature, so expect enhancement and additional actions (merge, hide, favorite faces) that come with this in future releases.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/euss0gtwrn0b1.png?width=2736&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=be3046ab1799ad8e17764e3ca567b57797af7c9c\">Curated people</a></p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/j76d3qxxrn0b1.png?width=2755&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=6b8cbfd262e49efe9bc1ef69cd0323cc15173959\">Photos with the target person</a></p>\n<h1>PARTNER SHARING</h1>\n<p>This is one of the most requested features we received, and we finally had a chance to integrate it into the application. You can now choose not only one or two but an unlimited number of users in your Immich instance to share your timeline. So you don\u2019t have to use the same account or manually put assets into a shared album.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/i7rnrhw0sn0b1.png?width=1742&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=7559bd3f0ba19da4fcfc5a0682a2792e533f0941\">Select partners</a></p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/mw7egdj1sn0b1.png?width=2723&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=4cfcbe3da5982f153b65628ef5da8a86d7924d15\">Partner's timeline can be accessed on the Sharing page</a></p>\n<h1>GLOBAL MAP VIEW</h1>\n<p>I know we all like to see where we have been over the world and the memory at each location. Immich now has the map view, in which you can see a group of photos/videos taken at those locations.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/ip3x3ju5sn0b1.png?width=2570&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=6684a9015adde7bc73d870422095a0ce9cd1f9f2</p>\n<h1>RESPONSIVE WEB INTERFACE AND WPA</h1>\n<p>The web interface is now usable over the web browser on your mobile phone. Thanks to all the contributors for helping make the web app responsive on the web.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/b82j1ou7sn0b1.png?width=641&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=fb36c1fe8940c74a7b91e494a05fce766eb213ff</p>\n<h1>ARCHIVING</h1>\n<p>You can now hide photos or videos you don\u2019t want to appear on the timeline to keep things tidy and safe for everyone. They will be available in the Archive section of the app.</p>\n<h1>SEARCHABLE DESCRIPTION</h1>\n<p>Even though Immich doesn\u2019t have an official custom tag system, you can now use the description as a dropped-in replacement for that. It can be fuzzy-search as well using the search functionality \ud83d\ude42</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/fx61tl99sn0b1.png?width=1035&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=7465a134161155010e1347dfc39b411d06a7cbae</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/lfr996q9sn0b1.png?width=1033&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=1e125eb3206f9a05e9edb86858920be4b69e630c</p>\n<h1>MANAGING LOGIN SESSION</h1>\n<p>We provide the functionality to view and manage all devices that use your user account to log in. So you can log them out for any suspicious device.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/pxa4m2dbsn0b1.png?width=1638&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=8c1efd7ff9cbfdbc8bd056a0d41902998b21bc73\">All logged-in sessions are shown.</a></p>\n<p>Finally, we keep fixing bugs, improving the server and clients, optimizing the performance, and solving technical debt as we are inching forward to a stable release milestone.</p>\n<p>I want to personally thank all the contributors and the users for helping make this release possible by providing feedback, support, testing, and development to the application. </p>\n<p>As always, thank you for using Immich, and I hope you enjoy this update.</p>\n<p>Remember to support the project!</p>\n<p>If you find the project helpful and it helps you in some ways, you can support the project\u00a0<a href=\"https://github.com/sponsors/alextran1502?frequency=one-time&amp;sponsor=alextran1502\">one time</a>\u00a0or\u00a0<a href=\"https://github.com/sponsors/alextran1502\">monthly</a>\u00a0from GitHub Sponsors.</p>\n<p>Join our friendly\u00a0<a href=\"https://discord.gg/D8JsnBEuKb\">Discord</a> for discussion and to get help!</p>\n<p>\ud83c\udf89 Cheer! \ud83c\udf89</p>\n<p>Alex</p></div>",

You need either your own domain or a <a href=\"https://tailscale.com/kb/1154/free-plans-discounts/\">GitHub Organization</a>. Sorry. We will fix this, but not today. Meanwhile, don\u2019t forget that you can use <a href=\"https://tailscale.com/kb/1084/sharing/\">Node Sharing</a> to share devices (including <a href=\"https://tailscale.com/kb/1103/exit-nodes/\">Exit Nodes</a>) across individual tailnets. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Has anybody tested this? Do I need to create a new account?  Can I migrate existing one with all the nodes? This sounds nice but is confusing.</p>\n<p>100 nodes. THAT is big one. I was using tailscale to do monitoring and because I had to be aconomical about my nodes I had to run tailscale containers in host mode. This change allows me to isolate them and let one TS docker container be accusable only  Prometheus or Influx DB and exporters. This is good for security and avoiding networking conflicts.</p>\n<p>No more subnet route limit. This one is a little bit more advanced but this is the one I am really exited about. Basically if you have a router that has tailscale installed and give that node an option to assign private IPs form that subnet... you will be able to access your router internal IPs just like you were at home. Very handy. </p>\n<p>All of this is awesome and I appreciate their transparency... though the post is TL;DR... still it's nice.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://tailscale.com/blog/pricing-v3/\">https://tailscale.com/blog/pricing-v3/</a></p>\n<p><strong>What about others?</strong></p>\n<p>Their closest alt is <a href=\"https://www.zerotier.com/\">https://www.zerotier.com/</a> with 25 nodes 1 user and unlimited subnets... I think... have not ran into a limit. They were ahead on what they allow before this change. <br />\nZT has one more problem... or had... stability. Using them I experienced that some (especially mobile) clients were crashing out after long term operation. There was a recent update that seamed to fix it.</p>\n<p>However Zerotier has 2 major advantages for selfhosting or why I prefer it (this is subjective understanding from reading docs and limited testing): <br />\na) P2P. There is no need for central node... ish... As long as network topology does not change there is no need to contact to routing server. <br />\nb) If your headscale server (tailscale self-hostable ) goes down your network goes down. With ZT you get get global routing servers as backups Also clients work flawlessly with selfhosted ZT. For example for Windows you need to edit registries to use headsclae server .</p></div>",

Unless you have a whole DevOps team, it usually brings more problems than benefits, and unnecessary infrastructure bills buried a lot of startups before they got anywhere.</p>\n<p>As for prerequisites, you can't be a complete beginner in the world of computers. If you've never even heard of Docker, if you don't know at least something about DNS, or if you don't have any experience with Linux, this course is probably not for you. That being said, I do explain the basics too, but probably not in enough detail for a complete beginner.</p>\n<p>Here's a 100% OFF coupon if you want to check it out:</p>\n<p>~~https://www.udemy.com/course/real-world-devops-project-from-start-to-finish/?couponCode=FREEDEVOPS2304FEEQK~~</p>\n<p>Edit: all gone!</p>\n<p>Be sure to BUY the course for $0, and not sign up for Udemy's subscription plan. The Subscription plan is selected by default, but you want the BUY checkbox. If you see a price other than $0, chances are that all coupons have been used already.\nYou can try manually entering the coupon code because Udemy sometimes messes with the link.</p>\n<p>The accompanying files for the course are at https://github.com/predmijat/realworlddevopscourse</p>\n<p>I encourage you to watch \"free preview\" videos to get the sense of what will be covered, but here's the gist:</p>\n<p>The goal of the course is to create an easily deployable and reproducible server which will have \"everything\" a startup or a small company will need - VPN, mail, Git, CI/CD, messaging, hosting websites and services, sharing files, calendar, etc. It can also be useful to individuals who want to self-host all of those - I ditched Google 99.9% and other than that being a good feeling, I'm not worried that some AI bug will lock my account with no one to talk to about resolving the issue.</p>\n<p>Considering that it covers a wide variety of topics, it doesn't go in depth in any of those. Think of it as going down a highway towards the end destination, but on the way there I show you all the junctions where I think it's useful to do more research on the subject.</p>\n<p>We'll deploy services inside Docker and LXC (Linux Containers). Those will include a mail server (iRedMail), Zulip (Slack and Microsoft Teams alternative), GitLab (with GitLab Runner and CI/CD), Nextcloud (file sharing, calendar, contacts, etc.), checkmk (monitoring solution), Pi-hole (ad blocking on DNS level), Traefik with Docker and file providers (a single HTTP/S entry point with automatic routing and TLS certificates).</p>\n<p>We'll set up WireGuard, a modern and fast VPN solution for secure access to VPS' internal network, and I'll also show you how to get a wildcard TLS certificate with certbot and DNS provider.</p>\n<p>To wrap it all up, we'll write a simple Python application that will compare a list of the desired backups with the list of finished backups, and send a result to a Zulip stream. We'll write the application, do a 'git push' to GitLab which will trigger a CI/CD pipeline that will build a Docker image, push it to a private registry, and then, with the help of the GitLab runner, run it on the VPS and post a result to a Zulip stream with a webhook.</p>\n<p>When done, you'll be equipped to add additional services suited for your needs.</p>\n<p>If this doesn't appeal to you, please leave the coupon for the next guy :)</p>\n<p>I hope that you'll find it useful!</p>\n<p>Happy learning,\nPredrag</p></div>",

Alex here! Look like spring is finally come, and I am back with Immich\u2019s monthly update to deliver some good news.</p>\n<p><strong>Revamped search experience</strong></p>\n<p>Since the last announcement of moving the machine learning service to Python, we\u2019ve revamped the search mechanism completely so you can search among hundred of thousand of photos quickly and accurately using natural language as the search term. So you can search for \u201clazy cat in the box\u201d or \u201cbaby wearing a yellow skirt and sitting under the sun.\u201d We can achieve this thanks to the pre-trained Open AI\u2019s CLIP model and the integration with Typesense (a self-hosted and open-source search engine). The accuracy of the search will blow you away. Typesense will also be used for our future facial search and grouping mechanism.</p>\n<p>Here are a few sample results:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/omcbagrmdqqa1.png?width=1249&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b6ed9cc4961ef19b8b5003d5f6a7f30dec821cae\">Search for \u201cred mushroom\u201d</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/yflswe4odqqa1.png?width=1243&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=fd63b9fc17ec08b1850a1757ebdb3e2f5ee41468\">Search for \u201cbird on the water\u201d</a></p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>We\u2019ve added the explore page to show the curated detected objects and locations and some selected categories so you can navigate to those searches quickly.</p>\n<p><strong>Offline mode</strong></p>\n<p>Previously, when the server was down or your phone didn't have an internet connection, tapping anything in the mobile app would send you back to the login screen. This is because the mobile app couldn\u2019t retrieve any data from the server. We've added a new feature that allows the mobile app to work offline, so you can still view your photos and videos cached or stored on your device even when the server is down or you don't have an internet connection.</p>\n<p>In addition, when viewing photos and videos residing on your device, these are no longer loaded from the server but directly from the device. This reduces your mobile data usage and increases the loading speed of thumbnails while scrolling the timeline.</p>\n<p>We've also improved a lot of UI/UX elements and optimized data querying on both the web and mobile apps so that you will have a good experience when browsing, searching, and viewing in Immich.</p>\n<p>I want to express my appreciation to all the contributors and the users who have been helping us use and test the application, reporting bugs. Immich is the project for the community and by the community.</p>\n<p>As always, thank you for using Immich, and I hope you enjoy this update.</p>\n<p>Remember to support the project!</p>\n<p>If you find the project helpful and it helps you in some ways, you can support the project\u00a0<a href=\"https://github.com/sponsors/alextran1502?frequency=one-time&amp;sponsor=alextran1502\">one time</a>\u00a0or\u00a0<a href=\"https://github.com/sponsors/alextran1502\">monthly</a>\u00a0from GitHub Sponsors.</p>\n<p>Join our friendly\u00a0<a href=\"https://discord.gg/D8JsnBEuKb\">Discord</a> for discussion and getting help!</p>\n<p>\ud83c\udf89 Cheer! \ud83c\udf89</p>\n<p>Alex</p></div>",
