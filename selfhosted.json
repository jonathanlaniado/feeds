The project has grown so much in terms of users, developers, features, maturity, and the community around it. When I started working on Immich, it was simply a challenge for myself and an opportunity to learn new technologies, crafting something fun and useful for my wife during my free time to satisfy my urge to build and create things. I never thought it would become so popular and help so many people. At the end of the day, all we have is memory. I am proud that the team and I have created something to make storing and viewing those precious memories easier without restrictions and without sacrificing our privacy. As the year closes, here\u2019s a recap of everything the project accomplished in 2023.</p>\n<p>Milestones</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Public shared links</li>\n<li>Favorites page</li>\n<li>Immich turned 1</li>\n<li>Material Design 3 on the mobile app</li>\n<li>Auto-link LivePhotos server-side</li>\n<li>iOS background backup</li>\n<li>Explore page</li>\n<li>CLIP search</li>\n<li>Search by metadata</li>\n<li>Responsive web app</li>\n<li>Archive page</li>\n<li>Asset descriptions</li>\n<li>10,000 stars on GitHub</li>\n<li>Manage auth devices</li>\n<li>Map view</li>\n<li>Facial recognition, clustering, searching, renaming, and person management</li>\n<li>Partner sharing and unifying timeline between partners' users</li>\n<li>Custom storage label</li>\n<li>XMP sidecar reading</li>\n<li>RAW file formats</li>\n<li>Justified layout on the web</li>\n<li>Memories</li>\n<li>Multi-select via SHIFT</li>\n<li>Android Motion Photos</li>\n<li>360\u00b0 Photos</li>\n<li>Album description</li>\n<li>Album performance improvements (time buckets)</li>\n<li>Video hardware transcoding</li>\n<li>Slideshow mode on the web</li>\n<li>Configuration file</li>\n<li>External libraries</li>\n<li>Trash page</li>\n<li>Custom theme</li>\n<li>Asset Stacking</li>\n<li>20,000 stars on GitHub </li>\n<li>Shared album activity and comments</li>\n<li>CLI v2</li>\n<li>Down to 5 containers (from 8)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Fun Statistics</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We have gone from the release version `1.41.0` to `1.90.0` at the time of writing.

Bugs will continue to be squashed and conquered. \u201cShit Alex wrote'' code will continue to be replaced by beautiful, clean code from Jason, Zack, Boet, Daniel, Osorin, Mert, Fynn, Marty, Martin, and Jonathan. The team has my eternal gratitude for creating a welcoming environment for new contributors, helping, teaching, and learning from each other. I\u2019ve realized that hardly a day has gone by where the team hasn\u2019t been in communication about Immich related topics over the past year.</p>\n<p>My long-term goal is to help hone Immich into a diamond in the FOSS space, where the UI, UX, development experiences, documentation, and quality are at a high standard while remaining free for everybody to use.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy Immich and have a happy and peaceful holiday.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Alex and the Immich Team</p>\n<p>Cheers! \ud83c\udf86\ud83c\udf86</p>",

With a simple change to their TOS this company can do all sorts of things, including charging for a previously free product or monetizing whatever data that can get from you.</p>\n<p>If there's one thing that we should all already know about VC funded internet startups, it's that they can and will pull the rug from underneath you when their bottom line demands it. See: streaming services cutting content while raising costs, sites like youtube and reddit redesigning to add more and more ads, hashicorp going from open source to close source. There's countless others. </p>\n<p>In the beginning there is often a honey moon period when a company is flush from cash from VC rounds and is in a \"growth at all costs\" mentality where they essentially subsidize the cost of services for new users and often offer things like a free tier. This is where Tailscale is today. Over time they eventually shift into a profit mentality when they've shored up as much of the market as they can (which Tailscale has already done a great job of).</p>\n<p>I'm not saying don't use Tailscale, or that it's a bad service (on the contrary their product UX is incredible and you can't get better than free), just that it's praise in this subreddit feels misplaced. Relying on a software-as-a-service company for your networking feels very much against the philosophy of self hosting.</p>",

I connected the Firestick and my other devices to the router before I left. At the hotel, I plugged my router in, connected it the wifi, and all my devices were then connected. I then was able to seamlessly stream directly from my home server using jellyfin and tailscale. It was awesome.</p>",

The process requires mastering various layers of the cloud stack, IAM roles, networking, and numerous tools, along with finding creative ways to test and debug code. In addition, long deployment times hinder iteration cycles and take me out of my creative flow.</p>\n<p>Other development disciplines have benefited from smart compilers that handle the lower levels of the stack and reduce developers' cognitive load. With Wing, we aim to bring the same benefits to cloud development with a language that treats the entire cloud as its target computer.</p>\n<h1>How to get Involved</h1>\n<p>We'd love to hear your feedback on any aspect of the project, and we're looking for developers to join our community to help shape Winglang's future.</p>\n<p>If you find Winglang interesting, please <a href=\"https://github.com/winglang/wing\">give us a \u2b50\ufe0f</a> on GitHub to bring the project to the attention of more developers \ud83d\ude4f. Your support is greatly appreciated!</p>\n<p>More Info</p>\n<p>You can find more info, including how to get started with Wing and why we're building it as a language, in our GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/winglang/wing\">https://github.com/winglang/wing</a>.</p>",

I worked on a beautiful UI like SendGrid and MailGun for more than six months. I plan to start a transactional email service.</p>\n<p>I bought a range and rented another /24 range because I didn't want to have a bad neighbour on the subnet. I even got my own ASN because jerks like UCEProtect often put big ISPs on a blacklist at the ASN level.</p>\n<p>Of course, I have got a decent\u00a0experience with this. I wrote my own SMTP server, email routing, and other things such as bounce and suppression handling. In a sense, everything is fine. RDNS, DKIM, DMARC, and SPF.</p>\n<p>I know that IP needs to warm up, so that's where I started. I paid for a few services to help me warm up, and it took me about two months to do so. Okay so far. The email was delivered 100% of the time to Gmail, but not at all to Yahoo and Outlook. The delivery rate to these two companies started to get better around last week, though. Some IP addresses started getting a 100% delivery rate.</p>\n<p>Then, I started testing my service on one of my websites. Of course, 100% transactional emails with account confirmation links ONLY. It was working great. Nearly 2,000 emails, 3,000+ opens and about 2,500 clicks daily on an average.</p>\n<p>I've also subscribed to Glock Apps and MXToolbox to measure my email deliverability and monitor IPs.</p>\n<p>Just today, I received an email with all half of my active IP addresses and sending/tracking domain blacklisted by Spamhaus. They categorize it under \"spam domain\", but I looked through my server logs (yes, everything is logged) and found no evidence of spam. Only transactional and warmup emails sent. I opened a ticket with Spamhaus and refuse to unblock my IP addresses and domains.</p>\n<p>I spent 6 months and $20,000+ working on this, only to be butchered by Spamhaus. How can Spamhaus be the police, judge and the executioner?</p>",

I discovered this do-it-yourself VPN solution about half a year ago and boy has it improved my life... Here is what I managed to accomplish with it.</p>\n<p>I am running Tailscale on my old macbook air, henceforth referred to as my \"server\", my two firesticks, and my phones.</p>\n<p>*remotely=outside of LAN, so over internet*</p>\n<p>-I can access my SMB shares remotely from my phones with OwlFiles and from my M1 Macbook air seamlessly through Finder. All I had to do was enter a simple command on my server in Terminal to add TCP/445 to \"Services\". Tailscale then forwards incoming TCP connections on port 445 from within my tailnet to port 445 on my mac\u2019s server. The result is that I am able to mount my 2TB share from anywhere I have internet and manage my files as though I was on my home network. I also have access to my entire media library from VLC installed on all my devices (once again, through SMB). If only I could somehow add my remote SMB shares to Kodi... But Kodi doesn't seem to allow me to type in custom IP addresses when trying to add SMB shares. Let me know in the comments if you know how to add remote SMB shares to Kodi (the ones it does not detect automatically).</p>\n<p>-Similarly, by adding a suitable HTTPS port to my server's Tailscale services, I am able to manage the Transmission torrent client installed on my server remotely through Transmission's web interface (while connected to Tailscale, of course).</p>\n<p>-I can back up to Time Machine remotely and accessing my Time Machine backups remotely as well. There are a few caveats though. On my server, I had to add a shared folder (from Settings), allow access to it via SMB and mark it as a Time Machine backup destination. The process is pretty straightforward. The trick is to add it as a backup destination THROUGH TAILSCALE by typing in the Tailscale IP of your server or the Magic-DNS domain name. Also, you will not be able to access pre-existing time machine backups through Tailscale! Only the destinations that you initially add through Tailscale. This is why I have two backup destinations on my server - one that I back up to from my LAN and one that I use over Tailscale remotely. Works like a charm!!!</p>\n<p>-I can control my server through VNC remotely and seamlessly as if I was connected to LAN. To do that, I had to add TCP/5900 to my server's Tailscale services (which is akin to opening up TCP port 5900 to incoming connections from within the tailnet). This is particularly useful when I don't have my M1 mac with me, but need to run Python code inside Spyder. I just turn on my bluetooth/trackpad combo, connect it to my S10+, jack myself into my tailnet, MultiVNC my way into my server and BAM.</p>\n<p>-MagicDNS deserves its own praiseful review. Not only did it assign a permanent, simple domain name to all my Tailscale-enabled devices, but it allowed me to configure my own DNS server for Tailscale-connected devices. I was then able to choose custom DNS servers for specific domains, which let me block FireTV updates without compromising my security (The DNS server used for that looks a little sketchy so I don\u2019t want all of my DNS requests to go through it) and also use AdGuard DNS without breaking Doordash\u2019s Dasher app by routing doordash-specific DNS requests to Google\u2019s DNS and not AdGuard\u2019s. Solid win here, as Adguard's DNS bricks the Dasher app. Let me know in the comments if you want to see my Magic-DNS configuration.</p>\n<p>-FUNNEL: By running a funnel (proxy) on my home server, I am able to access my dad's Bell Fibe TV channels through their web interface from anywhere on Earth - Bell treats my traffic as if it's coming from my home network! It will NOT work if you use the mobile app, but works flawlessly from within Samsung Internet, Safari (on mac) and Grazing 3 (on iOS). Also, it\u2019s quite neat to browse with my Canadian IP even when I am travelling (no more annoying \"cookie consent\" notices when in the EU). I suspect Netflix users could use this sort of setup to get around password-sharing restrictions. I am also running funnels on my firesticks just in case I need more bandwidth.</p>\n<p>-SUBNETS: I am running a subnet on my home server so that I could adb into my firesticks and manage them remotely with scrcpy (update apps, install tweaks, etc). Yes, I am not a huge fan of the command line \\^\\^' . I can also access my wifi cameras remotely from my mac. The desktop app for the cheap chinese ones only allows you to manage them over LAN, but Tailscale takes care of that. Works like a charm!</p>\n<p>I am beyond pleased with everything Tailscale enables me to do. It baffles me that this technology is somehow free to use. I am extremely grateful to be a part of the Tailscale community. Thank you!!</p>\n<p>Share your ideas and questions in the comments.</p>",

Even though I tried many options, none of them really appealed to me. The built-in bookmark managers in browsers were too basic and didn't allow me to organize my bookmarks in a way that made sense to me. The most popular external bookmark managers have been too simple, too complicated, or too expensive for what they offer.</p>\n<p>What I liked the most was the idea of having a bookmark manager with a relational database I had access to. This would let me retrieve my bookmarks in any way I wanted, and I could easily add new features in the future. I've searched for a solution that would allow me to do that, but I couldn't find anything that would fit my needs.</p>\n<p>And that's how the idea of the Grimoire was born. I wanted to create a bookmark manager that would be simple to use, but also powerful enough to let me organize my bookmarks in a way that made sense to me. Moreover, I wanted to take SvelteKit and PocketBase for a spin, and this seemed like a perfect opportunity to do so.</p>\n<h2>How it looks now<a href=\"https://grimoire.pro/blog/launch-time#how-it-looks-now\">\u200b</a></h2>\n<p>Starting with v0.1.0, Grimoire has most of the basic features you would expect from a bookmark manager:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>bookmarks:</li>\n<li>can be added, viewed, edited, and deleted</li>\n<li>can be organized into categories and tagged</li>\n<li>metadata, like title, description, HTML content, favicon, and image, is fetched from the website and stored locally</li>\n<li>can have notes added to them</li>\n<li>bookmark list:</li>\n<li>display in a grid or list view</li>\n<li>can be searched by title, description, URL, and tags</li>\n<li>filtering by category, tag, and and more</li>\n<li>sort by date added, domain, and more</li>\n<li>users:</li>\n<li>can sign up and sign in</li>\n<li>all bookmarks, categories, and tags are private to the user</li>\n<li>admin panel:</li>\n<li>is used to manage users and see their bookmark, category, and tag counts</li>\n<li>can be used to preview most of PocketBase settings</li>\n<li>other:</li>\n<li>it's dockerized, so it's easy to run it locally or deploy it to your server</li>\n<li>all the benefits of a self-hosted PocketBase installation, like scheduled backups (local and to S3), high performance, and data security</li>\n<li>dark mode, because dark wizardry requires darkness</li>\n<li>responsive design as magic should be accessible to everyone, everywhere</li>\n<li>early and experimental support for AI-powered features (more on that in the future), like automatic tag suggestions</li>\n<li>and that's just the beginning!</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What's next<a href=\"https://grimoire.pro/blog/launch-time#whats-next\">\u200b</a></h2>\n<p>It's still a work in progress, but I'm happy with the functionality provided so far. You can expect more useful features, like a way to import bookmarks from other services and export them to most popular file formats, public profiles, better admin panel, AI-powered features - just to name a few.

I loved Spore, from the time I got it for my 10th birthday to maybe the age of 16 or 17 I poured hundreds or probably thousands of hours into this game. As I got older I became less invested in the gameplay and more invested in the creative aspect of it. I designed some badass creatures and spaceships that I was really proud of. I had a whole line of Spaceships that all served different roles in my head cannon, with different races of aliens following different themes. </p>\n<p>EA/Maxis/whoever runs Spore now purged all of them from spore.com, and now they're gone.

To be clear, this is Plex telling other people what I've been watching from <em>my</em> server, with <em>my</em> files, and this is not OK. It also shows me what <em>they</em> have been watching on <em>their</em> server with <em>their</em> files. <strong>This is not OK!</strong></p>\n<p>https://imgur.com/a/DYR4wlh</p>\n<p>We all knew it was a matter of time before Plex started collecting data on our libraries and sharing it with advertisers. What happened to their \"we don't know, and don't want to know, what is on your server\"?. This, for me, is proof that those fears were absolutely founded in reality. On what planet would I ever want this information to be shared with friends on family on an OPT OUT basis? </p>\n<p>It's totally unacceptable to collect this data in the first place. It's totally unacceptable to share this information with uniquely identifiable information. And it's totally unacceptable to do this without explicitly asking me if it's OK. </p>\n<p>Unfortunately there is nothing you can do about this as a server admin, because technically these are <em>Plex</em> users and their marketing email preferences are controlled on the user side in the Plex website preferences. Not on your server.</p>\n<p><strong>This is an absolutely egregious overreach.</strong></p>\n<p>Thank goodness there are alternatives available in the form of Jellyfin and Emby. I left my Plex server up after the Jellyfin January challenge we did on the Self-Hosted podcast but because of this I feel that I have no choice but to take it down for good.</p>",

Includes anti-bot and     anti-DDOS  strategies.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>So what is this fully featured monitoring system? WELL, first of all it's important to note it is fully persistent. A lot of software have graphs, but they start populating only when you open the webpage, and then the data is forgotten when you close it. Cosmos has a fully persistent 24/7 highly optimizedd data gathering system, so that all graph shows data at all time.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/oqz4j9ubm3zb1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d511a33d99e72332264e89d2d4befdad728149c\">Graaaphs</a></p>\n<p>Why doing this? Isn't it a lot of storage? This is a good question: Monitoring is useless if it's not being looked at. And if not persistent, not only you have to be very lucky to open the webpage at the right time  to detect a problem, but also you can't have an alert system, which is the core of any good monitoring.</p>\n<p>But worry not, Cosmos has a pipeline that optimize your data in real time: the older the data, the less precise they get, in order to save your storage. It is also highly optimized in order to keep the RAM and CPU usage extremely low, even on very cheap servers. Monitoring is difficult to get right but I think you will find this will hit the spot!</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ulh4jgufm3zb1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b74f79b77afd73a807461a05329673ea5dd5c35\">Customizable alerts</a></p>\n<p>So how do you use this awesome tool? When designing it, I was very conscious of thinking \"how will users use it\". I did not want to just show graphs for the sake of having graphs, that is why I imagined an entire workflow, that starts in the dashboard.</p>\n<p>You see, you can zoom in and out of the graphs (you can test this in the demo: <a href=\"https://cosmos-cloud.io/cosmos-ui/\">https://cosmos-cloud.io/cosmos-ui/</a>) and when you do so, all the graph and the data in the tables are updating everywhere as you navigate. For example, highlight a peak of resources, and the right hand side table will tell you which container caused the resources peak:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/jdy0p8vim3zb1.png?width=1599&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01f9e661a68c73635fd4312916b36fddfa55dec0\">synchronizing, but also all the other graphs are changing at the same time</a></p>\n<p>Once you have identified a potential culprit, you can click on it to get their isolated metric:</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/y74tz3anm3zb1.png?width=1369&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79f59d70cdb988dc869b054746136d157525f515\">Looks like we have a culprit!</a></p>\n<p>You might think, \"alright pretty cool\", but it's over! Now that we know \"who\" caused  the issue, we might also want to know why. For this, we want to go to the last tab: \"events\". This is an improved version of logs with advanced search  (including BSON requests). That screen will tell us what happened. That screen also is synchronized with zooming into the graphs!</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/cmeqnfuqm3zb1.png?width=1584&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=50f90cad29cd4837523f13207e416b6df38329f2\">Looks like someone tried to force the shield!</a></p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Alright so that's neat, but also graphs are just pretty so I added them everywhere! Home screen, URL screen, container screen...</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/cxnm52jum3zb1.png?width=1666&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25ed7ce709f697f8d95bed365c7f413d0a9e1a64\">I will let you discover the other places ;)</a></p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>So anything else in that already huge updates? Well we have notifications! You will get notifications for many things including certificate renewing, alerts and container updates!</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/ct2lx22ym3zb1.png?width=522&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc458b7800b8c417282ca94cee54c566142158df</p>\n<p>Here's the entire changelog, and as always, Happy hosting!</p>\n<p>- New real time persisting and optimized metrics monitoring system (RAM, CPU, Network, disk, requests, errors, etc...)<br />\n - New Dashboard with graphs for metrics, including graphs in many screens such as home, routes and servapps<br />\n - New customizable alerts system based on metrics in real time, with included preset for anti-crypto mining and anti memory leak <br />\n - New events manager (improved logs with requests and advanced search)<br />\n - New notification system<br />\n - Added Marketplace UI to edit sources, with new display of 3rd party sources<br />\n - Added a notification when updating a container, renewing certs, etc...<br />\n - Certificates now renew sooner to avoid Let's Encrypt sending emails about expiring certificates<br />\n - Added option to disable routes without deleting them<br />\n - Improved icon loading speed, and added proper placeholder<br />\n - Marketplace now fetch faster (removed the domain indirection to directly fetch from github)<br />\n - Integrated a new docker-less mode of functioning for networking<br />\n - Added a dangerous IP detector that stops sending HTTP response to IPs that are abusing various shields features<br />\n - Added CORS headers to openID endpoints<br />\n - Added a button in the servapp page to easily download the docker backup<br />\n - Added Button to force reset HTTPS cert in settings<br />\n - Added lazyloading to URL and Servapp pages images<br />\n - Fixed annoying marketplace screenshot bug (you know what I'm talking about!)<br />\n - New color slider with reset buttons<br />\n - Redirect static folder to host if possible<br />\n - New Homescreen look<br />\n - Fixed blinking modals issues<br />\n - Add AutoFocus on Token field for 2FA Authentication (thanks u/InterN0te)<br />\n - Allow Insecure TLS like self-signed certificate for SMTP server (thanks u/InterN0te)<br />\n - Improve display of icons [fixes #121]<br />\n - Refactored Mongo connection code [fixes #111]<br />\n - Forward simultaneously TCP and UDP [fixes #122]</p>",

I don't want them to be discouraged because of FUD, as they say in the crypto community. Here goes...  </p>\n<p>I am the type of person who loves to solve problems and am always up for a challenge. Since getting into the self-hosting hobby, I have continuously searched for the next fun and practical service to self-host, which I am sure is what all of us do quite regularly. For me, that next service was email. I didn't have a clue where to begin, so I began to read into it, and immediately I noticed a pattern that was clear as day and consistent across all discussion boards including this one, and that message was \"self-hosting email is not worth the trouble\". The warnings made me very curious, and I just had to try for myself to see what this fearmongering about self-hosted email was. Well, I'm here to tell you that in my experience, all the warnings and cautions were nonsense and so far non-existent. I'll tell you right off the bat that there was zero magic involved. All I did was the following:  </p>\n<p>#1. Obtained a static IP from my ISP<br />\n#2. Chose Synology MailPlus on my NAS as my mail server<br />\n#3. Purchased a domain on <a href=\"https://www.porkbun.com\">www.porkbun.com</a> <br />\n#4. Followed the instructions on <a href=\"https://youtu.be/o66UFsodUYo?si=4GDATwQJtYsY2IT2\">this video</a><br />\n#5. Made sure all firewall rules on both my router and NAS are properly configured  </p>\n<p>That's it. Simple as that. Works great for sending and receiving mail. I have run numerous tests, and it's been rock solid for about 6 months now. Never had a single email lost or end up in junk mail folders with any of the big email providers. My advice is, if you are interested in hosting your own email and are on the fence because of the FUD that has been peddled across self-hosting communities, don't buy into that cynicism. It's perfectly doable, and I didn't find a single moment of it to be frustrating, despite not being exactly the most advanced user in this field.  </p>\n<p>If this post encourages just one person to pull the trigger, I'm happy</p>",

They also offered a version called \"pfSense Plus\" which was paid and offered a few more features but also support from Netgate, which is of course perfectly fine and very common (look at Proxmox for example).</p>\n<p>A while ago (1,5 years) they introduced \"<strong>Home+Lab</strong>\" as a product and license version in order for casual users and \"homelabbers\" to dip a toe into their commercial offerings which has more features than the CE. Basically like \"here you can use your enterprise version for free, but its a bit limited of course\". The obvious goal there is to motivate users to switch from the free CE to a paid version, again nothing wrong with that. <a href=\"https://www.portainer.io/take-3\">Portainer for example does this too</a>.</p>\n<p>Because of this, users switched from the \"always\" free CE version to the \"Home+Lab\" version, upgrading their installations and enjoying a few more features. According to Netgate, thousands of users have installed it. Great!</p>\n<hr />\n<h1>Now</h1>\n<p>But just now <a href=\"https://www.netgate.com/blog/addressing-changes-to-pfsense-plus-homelab\">Netgate have announced</a> major changes to this, out of the blue, <strong>without any prior notice</strong>. The free \"Home+Lab\" version is no longer available for download, its just gone.</p>\n<p>As a reason they cite that thirdparty sellers (on Aliexpress etc. i imagine) were downloading the \"better\" version of pfSense, aka the \"Home+Lab\" version, and installing it on their hardware appliances and then selling them. Without Netgate seeing any revenue from this. </p>\n<hr />\n<p>Please see <a href=\"https://www.netgate.com/blog/addressing-changes-to-pfsense-plus-homelab\">their blogpost</a> for all the details. But one crucial point is that anyone who is currently running their \"Home+Lab\" version, can keep running it (yay!) but they also say that <strong>future upgrades and bugfixes may require a subscription</strong>. So basically, users installed a free \"better\" version, which now doesnt exist anymore, and to continue using it with updates, they \"might\" need to pay a subscription fee. Something as crucial like a firewall appliance should be kept up to date for security, so just ignoring that is not really a option. And Netgate also state that if you have to reinstall your current \"Home+Lab\" version, they cannot provide that for free to you. And those subscriptions apparently come at a very high price. <strong>Are you willing to pay $400/year for your firewall software when youre only using it privately in your small homelab?</strong></p>\n<p>Paying for software, or any product, is not a bad thing. And companies need to make money, they need to pay employees. This should be obvious. There is no problem with that in itself. But the way this was done, telling their userbase for quite a while to try out this free version of the premium product, and then pulling the rug away underneath the feet, is just plain wrong and fucked up.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>\"Okay whatever, then just switch back to the actual free CE version!\"</em> Great idea, but apparently thats not so super easy.</p>\n<p><strong>Lawrence Systems</strong> have already made a excellent video summing up all these changes. I would recommend watching it to get the full picture, i can and want to only cover a bit here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXI6-E1nc5M\">Addressing Licence Changes to pfSense Plus Home and Lab</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>They also made a video about switching back from pfSense plus (aka Home+Lab?) to pfSense CE:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFUcmWTazGg\">How to Convert From pfsense plus 23.05 to pfsense CE 2.7</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Reading recent posts about this on /r/pfSense subreddit, the community seems to be quite angry about this. And it doesnt help that their subreddit is actually run by Netgate employees, so it isnt exactly a independent discussion forum there at all. For example a user tried to get feedback and support for <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/17hs7o2/bounty_for_pfsense_to_opnsense_conversion/\">a tool to convert pfSense configs to OPNsense configs</a>, and the moderators removed the post without further comment.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>My personal recommendation would be that this is a huge opportunity to finally switch away from pfSense, they have shown once again that they cannot be trusted. Take a look at the most obvious \"competitor\" /r/OPNsense /r/OPNsenseFirewall, they started as a fork of pfSense and have developed quite nicely.</p>\n<p>And to make it even more clear what kind of people are running Netgate (pfSense), if you havent read it yet, <a href=\"https://opnsense.org/opnsense-com/\">this is the story</a> of when users announced the fork OPNsense, how a <strong>employee of Netgate</strong> was running <code>opnsense.com</code> which was a mock website <strong>entirely made to shit on the OPNsense project and discredit them</strong>. <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20160314132836/http:/www.opnsense.com/\">I encourage you to look at it and make up your own mind about it</a>. And yes, <a href=\"https://www.netgate.com/blog/author/jamie-thompson\">this employee still works for them today it seems</a>. This alone should be reason enough to <strong>never use anything by Netgate</strong>, ever, wether its a free CE or paid.</p>\n<p>Atleast right now they are still offering the free and opensource CE version. But who knows how long that will last. They might as well kill that option without prior notice in a few months or a year from now. Its better to think about switching before being forced to.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>There have also been various other issues with Netgate\u00b4s behaviour towards their users over the years, but covering them all here would be too much and offtopic, i would like to focus this post mostly on the very recent issue.</p>\n<p>If people get angry about Oracle and seemingly shutting down \"free\" VPS instances at random, then they should be angry about Netgate pulling shit like this too.</p>\n<hr />\n<h1>TL;DR</h1>\n<p><strong>Stop using pfSense (just any Netgate products), switch to something else.</strong></p>\n<p>Its not the only alternative, but /r/OPNsense /r/OPNsenseFirewall is one major example.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Disclaimer: I am no pfSense expert, very far from it. If i got any of the history or current events wrong in this post, please let me know and i will immediately correct them. For me when the time came to pick a (virtualized) firewall/router appliance, i installed both pfSense and OPNsense in VMs and took a quick look. Even tho pfSense did leave a very \"enterprise-ish\" impression, it didnt feel right somehow, just odd in some way. Then looking at OPNsense, i felt immediately at home, i cant really narrow down why exactly. It simply felt much more open and friendly from the beginning. And i mean the software, at that point i had no idea what was going on between pfSense and OPNsense. All i knew was that OPNsense originated from pfSense, thats all. I tried both a tiny bit and quickly decided that i like OPNsense more, and thats what i have been using for a long time now and im very happy with it.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>None of the existing flair options seem to really fit to this, so forgive me for not having any flair. Mods feel free to overwrite any flair to this. And if a post about Jellyfins future is fitting here, then imo a post about demise of pfSense should be allowed too.</em></p>",

But then, I stumbled upon \"selfhosted\" by accident while researching a different app, which led me to the world of open-source software \u2013 something I had no prior knowledge of. When I realized I had to set up a server, I was in for a surprise.</p>\n<p>A kind soul directed me to the \"selfhosted\" subreddit. Spending an entire evening there opened my eyes to a world of possibilities I never knew existed. I had no idea you could do this. The reality hit me hard \u2013 I wasn't as smart as I thought.</p>\n<p>For the next four days, I immersed myself in learning how to host my own media server. It was challenging, especially since I'm not a programmer and had zero knowledge about dockers or containers. ChatGPT became my ally, helping me understand complex concepts in simple terms.</p>\n<p>Last night, I successfully set up my media server on an old gaming laptop using Jellyfin, Sonarr, Radarr, Requestrr, Jackett, and Heimdall. I'm absolutely delighted, especially with Requestrr, which makes my life so much easier.</p>\n<p>Now, I'm eager to explore self-hosting even further by setting up a music library, ebooks, photos, videos, a password manager, and more. I've come across options like Lidarr for music and Readarr for books, but I'd love to hear your recommendations.</p>\n<p>Is there a way to use a similar server setup like Sonarr for managing music and ebooks? I've tried Openbooks and Kavita, but Openbooks was a pain to set up and Kavita seems to be a library manager without a download option. Can you recommend something that I can download and use offline on my mobile for music and ebooks please?</p>\n<p>On a special note, I want to express my heartfelt thanks to everyone who's been patient and supportive, especially those who answered challenging questions in the subreddit. You're all truly amazing, and your guidance means the world to me. A big shoutout to all of you!</p>\n<p>People like you are rare, and you deserve all the good things in life.</p>",

It's been a while!!</p>\n<p>I was cooking something that took a long time in order to get there, but Cosmos now has its own VPN: <strong>Constellation</strong>! </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/9duklk7srysb1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=718d279c6d902ab1a6efc16b86fd34f918375d56\">yes I do find this arrow funny</a></p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>As a reminder, this exists alongside the existing features:</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>App Store</strong> \ud83d\udce6\ud83d\udcf1 To easily install and manage your applications, with simple installers, automatic updates and security checks</li>\n<li><strong>Customizable Homepage</strong> \ud83c\udfe0\ud83d\uddbc To access all your applications from a single place, with a beautiful and customizable UI</li>\n<li><strong>Reverse-Proxy</strong> \ud83d\udd04\ud83d\udd17 Targeting containers, other servers, or serving static folders / SPA with <strong>automatic HTTPS</strong>, and a <strong>nice UI</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Authentication Server</strong> \ud83d\udc66\ud83d\udc69 With strong security, <strong>multi-factor authentication</strong> and multiple strategies (<strong>OpenId</strong>, forward headers, HTML)</li>\n<li><strong>Container manager</strong>    \ud83d\udc0b\ud83d\udd27  To easily manage your containers and their settings, keep them   up  to  date as well as audit their security. Includes docker-compose    support!</li>\n<li><strong>Identity Provider</strong> \ud83d\udc66\ud83d\udc69 To easily manage your users, <strong>invite your friends and family</strong>     to your applications without awkardly sharing credentials. Let them     request a password change with an email rather than having you unlock     their account manually!</li>\n<li><strong>SmartShield technology</strong>    \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udee1  Automatically secure your applications without manual   adjustments  (see  below for more details). Includes anti-bot and   anti-DDOS  strategies.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Let me put it straight: Constellation has been a hell of a ride to release. It has been 2 months of hard work, to ensure it is stable, secure, but also that it properly integrate with other components of Cosmos (especially the reverse proxy). This is what you get:</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Full mesh VPN with P2P</li>\n<li>Complete UI to manage your network and devices</li>\n<li>The UI includes letting your users manage their own devices</li>\n<li>An internal DNS with Adblock list, custom entries and  DNSSEC (think pihole + unbound)</li>\n<li>A basic client application</li>\n<li>An integration to the reverse proxy (to secure your servapps easily)</li>\n<li>Multi-server setup (to bypass CGNAT or access isolated private servers)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/c7uwhj0fsysb1.png?width=981&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c6980dcec992a6ed9c5eac84a1678223976fe98f\">Secure your URLs in one click!</a></p>\n<p>Constellation itself is based on Nebula but build upon it, and will continue to do so. Some of the planned features for Constellation are</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Exit Nodes</li>\n<li>Internal Firewalls</li>\n<li>Probably some container interactions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>I am still actively working on the client applications, for now only Android and Windows are available but the other ones will follow up soon!</p>\n<h1>Why would you use Constellation rather than alternatives like Cloudflare Tunnel or Tailscale?</h1>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Cloudflare Tunnel is <strong>not</strong> a very good practice for security: first of all it leaves your origin server in your local network unprotected, and it also let CLoudflare see all your decrypted network. Tailscale is a better alternative, but not quite in the \"self-hosted\" philosophy as it relies on distant cloud servers. Now the closest thing you will get to what Constellation does, is something like OpenZiti. What Constellation offers you on top of it is the integration to the reverse proxy and the automatic DNS. </p>\n<p>For example, one of the big issues of VPN setups is \"how to tunnel my stuff\". You have multiple choices: Tunnel everything (but then it impact your everyday browsing). Have 2 sets of domains, or manually maintain a DNS with overwrites (both being annoying to do). Instead, Constellation automatically rewrite all your reverse proxy URLs on the fly to be tunneled through the VPN. It is also a full split tunnel so you can leave it on at all time.</p>\n<p>Why would you <strong>not</strong> choose Constellation?</p>\n<p>The three main reasons would be: The application might not be available yet for your platform, you don't want to self-host the discovery server (in case you need one, ex. for CGNAT), or you need the exit node functionality (aka. proxy all your network through the server. No ETA on this feature for now).</p>\n<p>Aside from this, few improvement to this version, here's the full changelog:</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Added Constellation</li>\n<li>DNS Challenge is now used for all certificates when enabled [breaking change]</li>\n<li>Rework headers for better compatibility</li>\n<li>Improve experience for non-admin users</li>\n<li>Fix bug with redirect on logout</li>\n<li>Added OverwriteHostHeader to routes to override the host header sent to the target app</li>\n<li>Added WhitelistInboundIPs to routes to  filter incoming requests based on IP per URL</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>It's good \"to be back\" from this adventure, as I have been pretty low-profile while this was taking a lot of my time, hope you enjoy the update!</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>",

It was a trip with many emotions. As I've grown older, my parents are getting older as well. Browsing photos of them just a few years back struck me again that all we will ever carry with us are memories. This realization has given me an even stronger sense of responsibility to preserve the memories in the family so that it is accessible to my family member from the past to the future generation so that the grandchild of my kid will know how lovely their great-great-grandparents were. </p>\n<p>While I was gone, the team took the development task autonomously with little of my participation. This made me very happy, as the project is now in the good hands of the contributors. My role recently has been focused on testing, QA, deployment, bug fixes, and small development tasks.</p>\n<p>I am looking forward to getting back into developing more significant features in the coming months. </p>\n<p>Within the last three months, Immich has gone from version <strong>1.71</strong> to <strong>1.81</strong> with many new features and improvements. I am happy to give you some recaps of the new features highlighted below.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Support for external libraries </li>\n<li>Video hardware transcoding</li>\n<li>Manually upload photos and video on the mobile app</li>\n<li>Optimizing views on most pages on the web</li>\n<li>UI/UX improvement for facial recognition actions</li>\n<li>Slideshow mode on the web</li>\n<li>Map view on mobile app</li>\n<li>Better settings configuration</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Support for external libraries</h1>\n<p>This feature was one of the community's first and most requested features. We had lengthy <a href=\"https://github.com/immich-app/immich/discussions/1006\">discussions</a>, some very heated because the feature was deemed as not the original goal of Immich, which served as a backup solution. Immich, since then, has evolved to be an excellent application to not only backup but also to browse and manage your memories. </p>\n<p>The community and contributors then took this feature into their own hands and implemented it. The work was completed in around 2 months with much development and testing effort from the contributors and helpful community members. I appreciate you all.</p>\n<p>You can now mount external libraries for different users to the container and have Immich scan them to display in the instance. All of Immich's goodies are accessible for photos and videos in the library. Please visit our <a href=\"https://immich.app/docs/features/libraries\">official documentation</a> for more information on how to use this feature.</p>\n<h1>Video hardware transcoding</h1>\n<p>You can now utilize hardware acceleration through supported CPUs or GPUs to transcode video faster and offload the work from hogging up the CPU. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/bhv4e5qybfsb1.png?width=1274&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99aaf27e16d0343de344504269a9153aaa72ff05\">Hardware acceleration settings</a></p>\n<h1>Slideshow mode on the web</h1>\n<p>This is the first iteration of the slideshow mode as an effort to get my children to sit still and look through the photos instead of watching Blippi. It is now only available on the web, and I plan to add it to the mobile app.</p>\n<h1>Map view on mobile app</h1>\n<p>You can see the location of your photos and videos on the map. This is a great way to see where your memories are located and where the events were happening.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/z57baddsbfsb1.png?width=761&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=667ccb0684837f480302b63fac0c5839ebe2280e\">Map view on mobile app</a></p>\n<h1>Better settings configuration</h1>\n<p>We have moved most configurable settings from the `.env` file to the admin interface. We also add the ability to create a config file to deploy new instances automatically. This will help many automation cases and assist folks who run hosting services with Immich as an option.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/3rn0rfd2cfsb1.png?width=1404&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=833be674fd3509e241fe2bcf7fb252c5a8422966\">Instance's settings page</a></p>\n<p>A lot of work is still planned for Immich to make it more resilient, better performance, and easier for you and the community. We hope Immich has helped you store, view, and manage your memory in an enjoyable way.</p>\n<p>I hope to work on Immich full-time one day; your donation makes a difference and will help me reach that goal quickly. </p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>As always, thank you for using Immich, and I hope you enjoy this update.</p>\n<p>Remember to support the project!</p>\n<p>If you find the project helpful and it helps you in some ways, you can support the project\u00a0<a href=\"https://github.com/sponsors/alextran1502?frequency=one-time&amp;sponsor=alextran1502\">one time</a>\u00a0or\u00a0<a href=\"https://github.com/sponsors/alextran1502\">monthly</a>\u00a0from GitHub Sponsors.</p>\n<p>Join our friendly\u00a0<a href=\"https://discord.gg/D8JsnBEuKb\">Discord</a> for discussion and to get help!</p>\n<p>\ud83c\udf89 Cheer! \ud83c\udf89</p>\n<p>Alex</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>",

Unless you have a whole DevOps team, it usually brings more problems than benefits, and unnecessary infrastructure bills buried a lot of startups before they got anywhere.</p>\n<p>As for prerequisites, you can't be a complete beginner in the world of computers. If you've never even heard of Docker, if you don't know at least something about DNS, or if you don't have any experience with Linux, this course is probably not for you. That being said, I do explain the basics too, but probably not in enough detail for a complete beginner.</p>\n<p>Here's a 100% OFF coupon if you want to check it out:</p>\n<p>https://www.udemy.com/course/real-world-devops-project-from-start-to-finish/?couponCode=FREEDEVOPS2310JMGQA</p>\n<p>Be sure to BUY the course for $0, and not sign up for Udemy's subscription plan. The Subscription plan is selected by default, but you want the BUY checkbox. If you see a price other than $0, chances are that all coupons have been used already.\nYou can try manually entering the coupon code because Udemy sometimes messes with the link.</p>\n<p>The accompanying files for the course are at https://github.com/predmijat/realworlddevopscourse</p>\n<p>I encourage you to watch \"free preview\" videos to get the sense of what will be covered, but here's the gist:</p>\n<p>The goal of the course is to create an easily deployable and reproducible server which will have \"everything\" a startup or a small company will need - VPN, mail, Git, CI/CD, messaging, hosting websites and services, sharing files, calendar, etc. It can also be useful to individuals who want to self-host all of those - I ditched Google 99.9% and other than that being a good feeling, I'm not worried that some AI bug will lock my account with no one to talk to about resolving the issue.</p>\n<p>Considering that it covers a wide variety of topics, it doesn't go in depth in any of those. Think of it as going down a highway towards the end destination, but on the way there I show you all the junctions where I think it's useful to do more research on the subject.</p>\n<p>We'll deploy services inside Docker and LXC (Linux Containers). Those will include a mail server (iRedMail), Zulip (Slack and Microsoft Teams alternative), GitLab (with GitLab Runner and CI/CD), Nextcloud (file sharing, calendar, contacts, etc.), checkmk (monitoring solution), Pi-hole (ad blocking on DNS level), Traefik with Docker and file providers (a single HTTP/S entry point with automatic routing and TLS certificates).</p>\n<p>We'll set up WireGuard, a modern and fast VPN solution for secure access to VPS' internal network, and I'll also show you how to get a wildcard TLS certificate with certbot and DNS provider.</p>\n<p>To wrap it all up, we'll write a simple Python application that will compare a list of the desired backups with the list of finished backups, and send a result to a Zulip stream. We'll write the application, do a 'git push' to GitLab which will trigger a CI/CD pipeline that will build a Docker image, push it to a private registry, and then, with the help of the GitLab runner, run it on the VPS and post a result to a Zulip stream with a webhook.</p>\n<p>When done, you'll be equipped to add additional services suited for your needs.</p>\n<p>If this doesn't appeal to you, please leave the coupon for the next guy :)</p>\n<p>I hope that you'll find it useful!</p>\n<p>Happy learning,\nPredrag</p>",

You can use it to access files on a server or a NAS in an easy and secure way.</p>\n<p>I've posted about Orb a few times in the past, but this time it's about the v1.0 release. With this release, I consider this project more or less done. That doesn't mean that there will be no more new releases, but for now I will focus more on <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/hsleisink/cauldron\">another open source project</a> that I'm working on.</p>\n<p>Orb was created to have a user friendly web interface to access my files on my server. A friend of mine runs it on a Raspberry Pi to access the files on his NAS at home while he's at work. The explorer application is therefore the most important application. It also allows you to share files or directories with other people. File viewers for PDF, Word and Excel files, text files, images, videos and ZIP files make it all more user friendly. But this wouldn't be a hobby project if I didn't some fun stuff. So, there is of course minesweeper, a DOS and C64 emulator and last but not least, Wolfenstein 3D! And yes, it's a nerd project, so it has a terminal.</p>\n<p>Download Orb from <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/hsleisink/orb/\">Gitlab</a> or give the <a href=\"https://desktop.leisink.net/\">demo account</a> a try. Have fun with it!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/8nnlk8t0ujrb1.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=30caa3e9d311ff8d0aff00f3f4cd6b7748a032f5\">Orb screenshot</a></p></div>",

I have this data backed up on an external HD that I keep at my moms house. </p>\n<p>Since I built my server a couple years ago, I mostly have been using my phone for photos and not a camera. I use google photos to back this up, my wife uses icloud. I want to implement immich and have us both move away from our respective back up solutions. I also want to pay for one 'cloud' back up solution to back up all of my configs plus our personal photos/videos (no interest in backing up my media, I don't have anything rare/hard to replace).    </p>\n<p>Is immich a good choice? Can it take and organize my existing 3 tb of data? Is there a better option than Immich plus Duplicacy for my use case?  </p>\n<p>I will add that I am pretty much a noob and can't problem solve too much on my own, my server was built almost solely by following ibracorp and spaceinvader tutorials. </p></div>",

And...the list is way bigger than I ever expected.  </p>\n<p>At this moment, my spreadsheet is 58 lines of various apps. Now that includes some hardware, like my synology, or the server ILOs..... but 58!??!  </p>\n<p>I think 34 of those are in docker. and what, 10 of them are media related. Jellyfin, all the servarr apps, then another 8 or 10 for downloaders and gluetun stacks.  </p>\n<p>So we come back to the title of the thread, how much time do you put into your setup in a given week? I work on servers all day, but it feels like I'm working on servers all night too.</p></div>",

I am looking to utilise a script to backup all the different databases housed inside my MariaDB instance . I came across Christian Lempa video of backing up linux servers (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoA6Bezgk1c\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoA6Bezgk1c</a>) and he provides a script in his video notes, which can be found here (<a href=\"https://github.com/ChristianLempa/scripts/blob/main/db-container-backup/db-container-backup.sh\">https://github.com/ChristianLempa/scripts/blob/main/db-container-backup/db-container-backup.sh</a>). But being a noob, I want to clarify if this script is saving all my mariadb databases for the various docker containers I am running. This line ( CONTAINER=$(docker ps --format '{{.Names}}:{{.Image}}' | grep 'mysql\\|mariadb' | cut -d\":\" -f1)  to me looks like its using docker command PS to list running containers with the name mysql or mariadb. I am running multiple docker containers that have mysql databases like Wallabag, tandoor, authelia, etc. Should I list out every container that has mysql database, so this script can backup those databases too or is this script backing up mysql and therefore all my databases that are housed inside mariadb instance? Apologies for what I am sure is making me sound like I should have no business self hosting lol but I am learning as I go. Thank you for any assistance :)   </p></div>",

Mind you, I went for TrueNAS Core instead of Scale, and I imagine I'd enjoy the latter more, but I've only got the one data drive for now which TrueNAS Scale says is below the minimum requirements.</p>\n<p>I think the main problem was how TrueNAS handled VMs, I couldn't bloody well figure out how things worked. I've done a cert in networking where we did some generalised virtualisation and sysadmin work in VMware which is really easy to use, but when trying to spin up a simple Debian VM, i noticed there were a bunch of hacky workarounds that were required to get me going.</p>\n<p>So, what did I end up going with in the end? Back on Proxmox? Did I pay for Unraid? Well... back in the day, I had Ubuntu server running off an old laptop of mine that mostly hosted Docker containers. There were a few things it ran baremetal, but for me I really enjoyed doing everything through Docker Compose and using Webmin.</p>\n<p>I've gone back to this setup full time and I don't see myself changing any time soon. For me, this is what works. Nothing super flashy, just plain old Ubuntu and some Docker containers. I'm gonna go and set up YAMS now :) Wish me luck!</p></div>",

As you may or may not have heard, a recent <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/\"><strong>Reddit policy change</strong></a> threatens to kill many beloved third-party mobile apps (<strong><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/13wxepd/rif_dev_here_reddits_api_changes_will_likely_kill/\">Reddit is Fun</a>, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/getnarwhal/comments/13wv038/reddit_have_quoted_the_apollo_devs_a_ridiculous/jmdqtyt/\">Narwhal</a>, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/baconreader/comments/13wveb2/reddit_api_changes_and_baconreader/\">BaconReader</a></strong>, and many more), making a various features not seen in the official mobile app permanently inaccessible to users. Starting on July 1st, Reddit has unilaterally decided to impose exorbitant charges on third-party app developers for utilizing their API. This includes the developer for <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/\"><strong>Apollo</strong></a>, being charged <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/\"><strong>1.7 million dollars per month</strong></a> for API requests.</p>\n<p>On June 12th, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1401qw5/incomplete_and_growing_list_of_participating/\"><strong>many subreddits</strong></a> will be <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1412ee8/what_going_dark_means_going_private_is_discouraged/\"><strong>going dark</strong></a> in protest of this policy change. Some will return after 48 hours; others will go away permanently unless the issue is adequately addressed. </p>\n<p><strong>/r/selfhosted</strong> is planning on joining these subreddits in solidarity, requesting that Reddit revisit this policy change. 3rd party applications have been the lifeblood of Reddit for the past 10+ years and should be here in the future.</p>\n<p><strong>What can you do?</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Complain.</strong> Message the mods of /r/reddit.com, who are the admins of the site, and comment in relevant threads on /r/reddit, such as <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/\">this one</a>, leave a negative review on their official iOS or Android app- and sign your username in support.</li>\n<li><strong>Spread the word.</strong> Rabble-rouse on related subreddits. Meme it up, make it spicy.</li>\n<li><strong>Boycott</strong> and spread the word to Reddit's competition! Stay off Reddit entirely from June 12th through the 13th- instead, maybe touch some grass, call your grandma, or go install that new app you've been dying to try.</li>\n<li><strong>Don't be a jerk.</strong> As upsetting as this may be, threats, profanity, and vandalism will be worse than useless in getting people on our side. Please make every effort to be as restrained, polite, reasonable, and law-abiding as possible.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Here are some helpful links on the topic:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/\">The official announcement from Reddit</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/13xh1e7/an_open_letter_on_the_state_of_affairs_regarding/\">An Open Letter from /r/ModCoord</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/zqptto18e34b1.jpg\">A helpful infographic on the topic</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/wiki/index\">A list of participating subreddits</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/5/23749188/reddit-subreddit-private-protest-api-changes-apollo-charges\">The Verge article on the subject</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Additional Info for /r/selfhosted</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>/r/datahoarder is orchestrating a joint effort in archiving Reddit.

I'm sure some of you have already heard about it, and I've seen posts of Lemmy(ers?) posting that everyone neeeeeeds to switch immediately.  I don't want to be one of those posters.</p>\n<h2>Why would we want an alternative?</h2>\n<p>I won't go into all of the details here, as there are now dozens of posts, but essentially Reddit is killing off 3rd party apps with extremely high pricing to access their data.  To most of us who have been with Reddit for years, this is just the latest in a long line of things Reddit has changed about the site to be more appealing to Wall Street.  I don't want to argue here if the sky is falling or if people should or shouldn't be leaving Reddit, I'm simply here showing an alternative I think has promise.</p>\n<p>Links if you do want to find out more of what's happening</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/\">Apollo Developer explaining how it will effect his one app</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/13xh1e7/an_open_letter_on_the_state_of_affairs_regarding/\">Mod post on how these changes will effect their communities</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ypwgu1BpaO0\">Hour long interview with Apollo Dev for more detail</a></p>\n<h2>What is it?</h2>\n<p>Lemmy is a \"federated\" Reddit alternative.  Meaning there is no \"center\" server, servers interconnect to bring content to users.  If you use Mastadon, it's exactly like Mastadon.  I view it like Discord, where there are many servers (they call them instances) and inside those servers are different communities.  You can belong to a memes community on one server and another server.  The difference is these communities are in a Reddit forum format, and you pick your own home screen, meaning you can subscribe to communities from other servers.</p>\n<p>Long story short, you can subscribe to as many communities (subreddits) as you want from wherever you are.</p>\n<p>The downside is that it's confusing as hell to wrap your head around, and for most users it requires explaning.  The developers know this, Mastadon had to release a special wizard to help people join, and I think Lemmy will need to do something similar.</p>\n<p>So essentially, there are communities (analogous to subreddits) that live on instances (analogous to servers).  People can sign up for any instance they want, and subscribe not only communities on that instance, but any Lemmy instance.  To me, that's pretty neat, albeit complicated.</p>\n<h4>Pros so far:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The community is extremely nice so far, it feels like using Reddit back in the early 2010s.  No karma farming, cat pictures are actually just pictures of cats, memes are fun, people seem genuinely happy to be there</li>\n<li>Work is being done to improve it actively, new features are on the board and work is being done consistently</li>\n<li>Federated is a cool thing, there's no corporate governance to decide what is okay or not (more in cons)</li>\n<li>It's honestly the best alternative I've seen so far</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Cons so far:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>As mentioned it's confusing just getting started.  This is the number 1 complaint I read about it, and it is.  Sounds like the devs hear this and are challenging themselves to get an easier onboarding process up and running.</li>\n<li>The reason for this post, second biggest complaint, missing niche communities.  I'm hoping some people here help resolve this issue</li>\n<li>Not easy to share communities.  Once created, instance owners have to do quite a bit of evangelizing.  There's join-lemmy.org where if you have an instance, an icon, and a banner image it will start showing, but beyond that you have to post about your instance in relevant existing communities that you exist, and get people to join.</li>\n<li>It's very early.  The apps are pretty bare bones, it's in it's infancy.  I think it's growing though, and  I think this will change, but there's definitely been a few bugs I've had to deal with.</li>\n<li>Alt-right/Alt-left instances.  Downside of being federated, anyone can create an instance.  There are already some fringe communities.  You do have power to block them from your instance though, but they're offputting when you first get there, it takes a bit to subscribe to communities and block out the ones that are... out there.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Sure, but how does SelfHosted come in?</h2>\n<p>Since Lemmy is \"federated\", these instances come from separate servers.  One thing I see about Lemmy right now is that there are a lot of \"general\" instances, each with a memes community, a movies, music, whatever, but there aren't a lot of the specific communities that brought people to Reddit.  Woodworking, Trees, Art, those niche communities we all love are missing because there is not a critical mass of people.</p>\n<p>This is where selfhosting comes in.  Those communities don't fit well on other instances because those instances are busy managing their own communities.  For example, there are several gaming communities, but there are no specific communities for specific games.  No Call of Duty, no Mass Effect, no Witcher, etc.  Someone could run an RPG specific instance and run a bunch of specific RPG communities.  Same with any other genre.</p>\n<p>This is where I see Lemmy headed, most people join the larger instances, but then bring in communities they care about.</p>\n<h2>What's it like running an instance?</h2>\n<p>Right now most communities there are very tiny, my personal instance has about 10 people on it.  That is quite different from the subreddit alternative, but I see that as a positive personally.  I'm hoping to grow my fledgling community into something neat.</p>\n<p>If the hammer falls I see a mild migration to Lemmy.  I don't think it'll be like the Digg migration, but I think there could be many users who give up on Reddit and I want them to have a stable landing place.  Communities I've come to love I want to be able to say \"Hey, I'm over here now, you're welcome to join me.\"  </p>\n<p>There are several million 3rd party app users who access Reddit through 3rd party apps.  If only 10% of them decide to switch to an alternative once they are no longer able to access Reddit, that means a couple hundred thousand people will be looking for new homes.  I think we have an opportunity to provide them.</p>\n<p>I'm coming up on character limit, so if anyone is interested - the only requirements are a domain name and a host.  Everything is dockerized, and I'm happy to share my docker compose with anyone.  I followed the guide <a href=\"https://join-lemmy.org/docs/en/administration/install_docker.html\">here</a> but there were a lot of bumps and bruises along the way.  I'm happy to share what I learned.</p>\n<p>Anyway, thanks for reading all this way.  I recognize this may not be for everyone, but if you ever wanted to run your own community, now is your chance!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy\">GitHub Project</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://join-lemmy.org/docs/en/administration/install_docker.html\">Installation Guide</a></p>\n<p>Edit: Lots of formatting</p></div>",

Unless you have a whole DevOps team, it usually brings more problems than benefits, and unnecessary infrastructure bills buried a lot of startups before they got anywhere.</p>\n<p>As for prerequisites, you can't be a complete beginner in the world of computers. If you've never even heard of Docker, if you don't know at least something about DNS, or if you don't have any experience with Linux, this course is probably not for you. That being said, I do explain the basics too, but probably not in enough detail for a complete beginner.</p>\n<p>Here's a 100% OFF coupon if you want to check it out:</p>\n<p>~~https://www.udemy.com/course/real-world-devops-project-from-start-to-finish/?couponCode=FREEDEVOPS2306JEOZX~~</p>\n<p>Edit: All gone! Check back next month.</p>\n<p>Be sure to BUY the course for $0, and not sign up for Udemy's subscription plan. The Subscription plan is selected by default, but you want the BUY checkbox. If you see a price other than $0, chances are that all coupons have been used already.\nYou can try manually entering the coupon code because Udemy sometimes messes with the link.</p>\n<p>The accompanying files for the course are at https://github.com/predmijat/realworlddevopscourse</p>\n<p>I encourage you to watch \"free preview\" videos to get the sense of what will be covered, but here's the gist:</p>\n<p>The goal of the course is to create an easily deployable and reproducible server which will have \"everything\" a startup or a small company will need - VPN, mail, Git, CI/CD, messaging, hosting websites and services, sharing files, calendar, etc. It can also be useful to individuals who want to self-host all of those - I ditched Google 99.9% and other than that being a good feeling, I'm not worried that some AI bug will lock my account with no one to talk to about resolving the issue.</p>\n<p>Considering that it covers a wide variety of topics, it doesn't go in depth in any of those. Think of it as going down a highway towards the end destination, but on the way there I show you all the junctions where I think it's useful to do more research on the subject.</p>\n<p>We'll deploy services inside Docker and LXC (Linux Containers). Those will include a mail server (iRedMail), Zulip (Slack and Microsoft Teams alternative), GitLab (with GitLab Runner and CI/CD), Nextcloud (file sharing, calendar, contacts, etc.), checkmk (monitoring solution), Pi-hole (ad blocking on DNS level), Traefik with Docker and file providers (a single HTTP/S entry point with automatic routing and TLS certificates).</p>\n<p>We'll set up WireGuard, a modern and fast VPN solution for secure access to VPS' internal network, and I'll also show you how to get a wildcard TLS certificate with certbot and DNS provider.</p>\n<p>To wrap it all up, we'll write a simple Python application that will compare a list of the desired backups with the list of finished backups, and send a result to a Zulip stream. We'll write the application, do a 'git push' to GitLab which will trigger a CI/CD pipeline that will build a Docker image, push it to a private registry, and then, with the help of the GitLab runner, run it on the VPS and post a result to a Zulip stream with a webhook.</p>\n<p>When done, you'll be equipped to add additional services suited for your needs.</p>\n<p>If this doesn't appeal to you, please leave the coupon for the next guy :)</p>\n<p>I hope that you'll find it useful!</p>\n<p>Happy learning,\nPredrag</p></div>",
