Found Plex and found out how to download movies/TV shows.</p>\n<p>Then manually searching for content became a pain. So I automated the process with my Arr stack.</p>\n<p>Then in 2020 I found network chuck who introduced me to docker with his portainer video. Along with the basics of Linux &amp; Networking.</p>\n<p>Fast forward 4 years now (24 now)  I have a whole homelab infrastructure. 2 proxmox nodes, TrueNas, AWX, Cloud machines, authentik, probably 45 Virtual machines in total all for different services. 7 domains and countless subdomains, CI/CD for Git repos, etc. If it's open source and can be installed in a homelab, ive probably tried it.</p>\n<p>Anyway, before this I didn't know anything about Linux/tech. Was working a sales job. But this has became an addiction lol. I fully credit this subreddit for showing me what's all out there.</p>\n<p>I don't have any certs so getting IT job was gonna be hard.\nOne day I finally said I'm done with sales and applied for some IT jobs. Got an interview at a VOIP company and I didn't know a thing about VoIP but they were impressed with my homelab and understanding of systems, so they hired me.</p>\n<p>Now here I am 8 weeks later, working on PBX systems, SSH'ing into Linux servers and troubleshooting, remoting into clients networks, configuring VM's, etc. Basically exactly what I do at home. And doing so well some of the more advanced people in the office think I should moving up to sysadmin.</p>\n<p>Most of my coworkers all have A+, Net+ and Sec+ and I'm hanging right in there with them, I teach them things that I've learned by going the self hosted route, they teach me things from the certificate route.</p>\n<p>Anyways, I just wanted to thank this subreddit. Thanks for sharing your open source projects, thanks for all the help I've received over the last few years. I guess it is all starting to pay off. If I can do it you can too.</p>",

I have never seen this mentioned anywhere or in any tutorial I have ever followed. </p>\n<p>When you spin up a docker container using the host network its port mappings will override your firewall rules and open those ports, even if you already created a rule to block that port. Might not be that big of a deal unless you\u2019re on a publicly accessible system like a VPS! </p>\n<p>When you\u2019re setting up a container you need to modify your port bindings for any ports you don\u2019t want accessible over the internet. </p>\n<p>Using NGINX Proxy Manager as an example:</p>\n<p><code>ports:\n    - \u201880:80\u2019\n    - \u2018443:443\u2019\n    - \u201881:81\u2019</code></p>\n<p>Using these default port bindings will open all those ports to the internet including the admin UI on port 81. I would assume most of us would rather manage things through a VPN and only have the ports open that we truly need open. Especially considering that port 81 in this case is standard http and not encrypted. </p>\n<p>To fix this was surprisingly easy. You need to bind the port to the interface you want. So if you only want local access use <code>127.0.0.1</code> but in my example I\u2019m using Tailscale. </p>\n<p><code>ports:\n    - \u201880:80\u2019\n    - \u2018443:443\u2019\n    - \u2018100.0.0.1:81:81\u2019</code></p>\n<p>This will still allow access to port 81 for management, but only through my Tailscale interface. So now port 81 is no longer open to the internet, but I can still access it through Tailscale. </p>\n<p>Hopefully this is redundant for a lot of people. However I assume if I have gone this long without knowing this then I\u2019m probably not the only one. Hopefully this helps someone. </p>",

Full disclosure: I'm not an advanced user, nor am I an authority on this subject whatsoever. I mainly use reverse proxies for accessing simple local services with SSL behind memorable URLs and haven't dipped my toes into anything more complex than integrating Authentik for SSO. I prefer file-based configuration, avoid complexity, and don't need advanced features; so this list certainly won't be valuable for everyone. Feel free to share your opinions; I'd love to hear what everyone else is using.</p>\n<p>Here's my opinionated review of the reverse proxy solutions I've tried, ranked from most likely to recommend to newcomers to least likely:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://caddyserver.com/docs/quick-starts/reverse-proxy\">Caddy</a>: As easy as it could possibly get, and by far the most painless reverse proxy I've used. It's extremely lightweight, performant, and modular with plenty of extensions. Being able to configure my entire home network's reverse proxy hosts from a single, elegantly formatted Caddyfile is a godsend. Combined with the <a href=\"https://github.com/coder/code-server\">VS Code Server</a> for easy configuration from a browser, I couldn't recommend a more painless solution for beginners who simply want to access their local services behind a TLD without browser warnings. Since I have my own FQDN through Cloudflare but don't have any public-facing services, I personally use the <a href=\"https://github.com/caddy-dns/cloudflare\">Cloudflare DNS provider Caddy addon</a> to benefit from full SSL using just a single line of configuration. Though, if your setup is complex enough to require using the JSON config, or you rely heavily on Docker, you might also consider Traefik.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/\">Traefik</a>: Probably the most powerful and versatile option I've tried, with the necessary complexity and learning curve that entails. Can do everything Caddy can do (perhaps even better depending on who you ask). I still use it on systems I haven't migrated away from Docker as the label system is fantastic. I find the multiple approaches to configuration and the corresponding documentation hard to wrap my head around sometimes, but it's still intuitive. Whether or not I'd recommend Traefik to \"newcomers\" depends entirely on what type of newcomer we're talking about: Someone already self-hosting a few services that knows the basics? Absolutely. My dad who just got a Synology for his birthday? There's probably better options.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://zoraxy.arozos.com/#home\">Zoraxy</a>: The best GUI-based reverse proxy solution I'm familiar with, despite being relatively new to the scene. I grew out of it quickly as it was missing very basic features like SSL via DNS challenges when I last tried it, but I'm still placing it high on the list solely for providing the only viable option for people with a phobia of config files that I currently know of. It also has a really sleek interface, although I can't say anything about long-term stability or performance. YMMV.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.f5.com/go/product/welcome-to-nginx\">NGINX</a>: Old reliable. It's only this far down the list because I prefer Traefik over vanilla NGINX for more complex use cases these days and haven't used it for proxy purposes in recent memory. I have absolutely nothing bad to say about NGINX (besides finding the configuration a bit ugly) and I use it for public-facing services all the time. If you're already using NGINX, you probably have a good reason to, and this list will have zero value to you.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/9bV5zQbrp_Q?t=9\">NGINX Proxy Manager</a>: Unreliable. It's this far down the list because I'd prefer anything over NPM. Don't let its shiny user-friendly frontend fool you, as underneath lies a trove of deceit that will inevitably lead you down a rabbit hole of stale issues and nonexistent documentation. \"I've been using NPM for months and have never had an issue with it.\" WRONG. By the time you've read this, half of your proxy hosts are offline, and the frontend login has inexplicably stopped working. Hyperbole aside, my reasoning for not recommending NPM isn't that it totally broke for me on multiple occasions, but the fact that a major rewrite (v3) is supposedly in the works and the current version probably isn't updated as much as it  should be. If you're starting from scratch right now, I'd recommend anything else for now. Just my experience though, and I'm curious how common this sentiment is.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Honorable mentions</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.linuxserver.io/general/swag/\">SWAG</a>: Haven't used this one since I moved away from Docker, but I've seen it recommended a ton and it seems the <a href=\"http://linuxserver.io\">linuxserver.io</a> guys are held in pretty high regard. It's definitely worth a look if you use Docker or want an alternative Traefik.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.haproxy.org/\">HAProxy</a><strong>:</strong> I didn't include it in the list because I was using the OPNsense addon and nearly went insane in the process. It might have just been the GUI, but it's the only reverse proxy solution I've used that made me actively feel like a moron. Definitely has its purpose, but I personally had no reason to keep putting myself through that   </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Edit: Clarified my reasoning for the NPM listing a bit more as it came off a bit inflammatory, sorry. I lost a lot of sleepless nights to some of those issues.</p>",

Miraculously google fu blesses me and I find this thread below where people are having the same problems. They're all coming to same slow realization of what is happening. That godaddy pulled some horseshit without telling anyone.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/godaddy/comments/1bl0f5r/am_i_the_only_one_who_cant_use_the_api/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/godaddy/comments/1bl0f5r/am_i_the_only_one_who_cant_use_the_api/</a></p>",

Over the past two years, it has taken significant dedication, time, and effort.</p>\n<p>Recently, a company in Austin, Texas, called FUTO contacted the team. FUTO strives to develop quality and sustainable open software. They build software alternatives that focus on giving control to users. From their mission statement:</p>\n<p>\u201cComputers should belong to you, the people. We develop and fund technology to give them back.\u201d</p>\n<p>FUTO loved Immich and wanted to see if we\u2019d consider working with them to take the project to the next level. In short, FUTO offered to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pay the core team to work on Immich full-time</li>\n<li>Let us keep full autonomy about the project\u2019s direction and leadership</li>\n<li>Continue to license Immich under AGPL</li>\n<li>Keep Immich\u2019s development direction with no paywalled features</li>\n<li>Keep Immich \u201cbuilt for the people\u201d (no ads, data mining/selling, or alternative motives)</li>\n<li>Provide us with financial, technical, legal, and administrative support</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After careful deliberation, the team decided that FUTO\u2019s vision closely aligns with our own: to build a better future by providing a polished, performant, and privacy-preserving open-source software solution for photo and video management delivered in a sustainable way.</p>\n<p>Immich\u2019s future has never looked brighter, and we look forward to realizing our vision for Immich as part of FUTO.</p>\n<p>See our post <a href=\"https://immich.app/blog/2024/immich-core-team-goes-fulltime\">here</a> for full details about this change, including answers to frequently asked questions.

It started off as a project to help me learn Go and has evolved into something I use every day. There is still much to be done - an actual logo, more features, customizations, widgets, bug fixes, etc, and I'm looking forward to learning further and getting better at Go as I continue to work on this project.</p>\n<p>Configuring the dashboard has a bit of a learning curve to it but I've provided a simple <a href=\"https://github.com/glanceapp/glance/blob/main/docs/configuration.md#preconfigured-page\">preconfigured page</a> to help you get started.</p>\n<p>A docker container is available so installation is pretty straightforward, just make sure you have a valid <code>glance.yml</code> file:</p>\n<pre><code>docker run -d -p 8080:8080 \\\n  -v ./glance.yml:/app/glance.yml \\\n  -v /etc/timezone:/etc/timezone:ro \\\n  -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro \\\n  glanceapp/glance\n</code></pre>\n<p>(localtime and timezone are required for the calendar to work properly)</p>\n<p>I don't blame you if you're skeptical about running random containers from projects that came out literally today - you absolutely should be! You are more than welcome to build the project yourself from source and run it however you prefer. So long as you have Go installed it's as simple as <code>go build .</code></p>\n<p>Can't wait to see what kind of page configurations and themes people come up with!</p>",

Not just slower than it should be, not just slow to sync files, but slow in every single respect. We're talking 3-5 seconds to load every web page slow. We're talking 100KB-300KB max transfer rate slow. It's been truly unusably slow. In the last 3 years I have poured more hours than I care to think about into performance tuning. Modifying PHP FPM settings, throwing more CPU+RAM at the problem, playing with disk mount parameters. The works. In all that time I've gotten page loads down to 2-3 seconds and transfers to reliably hit 1MB. Better, but still dear lord.</p>\n<p>Between this issue and the fact that every time I update it I have to essentially rebuild the application because something breaks, I had essentially written off Nextcloud. It was good enough for the things I didn't care about customizing (calendar, file sync, phone backup, etc) as long as I use external clients instead of the web interface. Oh well, maybe someday I'll revisit it and switch to something else.</p>\n<p>A bit about my setup for background: I run a distributed cluster currently with 5 nodes all of which have storage and compute resources. Docker Swarm manages container orchestration and GlusterFS pools the storage blocks into one replicated network disk. Within Swarm I have stacks for each application I run and one \"core\" stack that handles common resources like the reverse proxy, LetsEncrypt, etc. So I have a Nextcloud stack with its own containers isolated and the reverse proxy simply handles SSL termination and forwarding 80/443 to that stack where it gets picked up by the web server within the Nextcloud stack.</p>\n<p>Fast forward to last week and I found <a href=\"https://github.com/flor0/nextcloud-docker\">this repo</a> that uses a custom built FPM container to run Nextcloud. Up until now I'd been using <a href=\"https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one\">AIO</a> and hated it. I didn't want 2/3 of the features but disabling them broke things so I ended up maintaining a stack that was way heavier and more complicated than I needed it to be. When I found the minimal FPM implementation I was ecstatic and immediately began switching to it (it didn't help that my Nextcloud was down at the time because of another update migration failure). I got it working locally on my workstation for testing and it was <em>fast</em>! Like blazingly, like \"this is how a webpage should work\" fast! I was over the moon! Converted the local dev stack to a production ready one, backed up my existing installation, deployed it to my cluster and... it's slow. Still faster than the old setup, but just barely. Goddammit. \"Maybe my infrastructure just isn't compatible with Nextcloud\" I think to myself, \"Maybe the computer gods have simply deemed me unworthy\". Oh well, this new setup will still make updates easier down the road so no sense in going back to AIO, so may as well complete the migration.</p>\n<p>I'm working my way through the Nextcloud post-install warnings on the overview page when I notice one I'd never seen before:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Your client has been identified as <code>&lt;ip in my nextcloud stack network&gt;</code> and has been rate limited. If this is unexpected your reverse proxy configuration may be incorrect.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Easy enough to fix. The PHP-FPM container is detecting all requests coming from the web server as originating from the same client and rate limiting them. Add the Nextcloud stack network to the <code>trusted_proxies</code> config parameter and the error goes away. Not a problem, but the little spinning beach ball in my head doesn't go away. Somethings bothering me about it, but I'm not sure what yet, so I continue with the migration. I start getting my phone hooked back up to the new server: app login goes fine, but when I try to connect DAVx to sync calendars I get \"Cannot login: [429] failed\". 429 is Too Many Requests. Lightbulb.</p>\n<p>At the debug level of the Nginx logs for the Nextcloud stack web server I find my smoking gun:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Client <code>&lt;ip of my core reverse proxy&gt;</code> is rate limited</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I add the IP of the <em>core</em> reverse proxy to the <code>trusted_proxies</code> config parameter, restart Nextcloud, and... it's fast! Like really fast! Like literally faster than I have ever personally seen Nextcloud run, ever, in my life! For the first time I am experiencing the Nextcloud I've heard people talk so highly of but had never actually used! Because I had configured <code>trusted_proxies</code> and the request seemed to be coming from outside the local (Nextcloud stack) network Nextcloud itself detected the IP of my core reverse proxy as an external IP and so didn't give me the \"your reverse proxy config may be wrong\" error. But because it was treating the core reverse proxy as an external client all requests from two laptops, a desktop, and a phone appeared to be coming from a single source and so got throttled to hell and back. I'm not sure if this was the same issue I was having under AIO, but it's very possible. </p>\n<p>Either way, I'm glad to now be running a stable, updatable, minimal, and <em>correctly configured</em> version of Nextcloud.</p>\n<p>TL;DR: I hated Nextcloud for 3 years because it was painfully slow, not realizing that a quirk of my lab setup was causing all clients to get lumped into a single rate-limit bucket. Correctly identifying my lab's reverse proxy to Nextcloud solved the issue and it's now a solid core to my lab services.</p>",

That goes way too far.  No other datacenter company requires this. </p>\n<p>Here is the relevant section from Vultr's new TOS:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>information, text, opinions, messages, comments, audio visual works, motion pictures, photographs, animation, videos, graphics, sounds, music, software, Apps, and any other content or material that You or your end users submit, upload, post, host, store, or otherwise make available (\u201cMake Available\u201d) on or through the <strong>Services</strong> (collectively, \u201cYour Content,\u201d \u201cContent\u201d or \u201cUser Content\u201d).</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>You hereby grant to Vultr a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide license (including the right to sublicense through multiple tiers) to use, reproduce, process, adapt, publicly perform, publicly display, modify, prepare derivative works, publish, transmit and distribute each of your User Content, or any portion thereof, in any form, medium or distribution method now known or hereafter existing, known or developed, and otherwise use and <strong>commercialize the User Content in any way that Vultr deems appropriate, without any further consent, notice and/or compensation to you</strong> or to any third parties, for purposes of providing the Services to you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is NOT standard contract language for web services.  I don't know of anywhere else that requires this.</p>\n<p>For comparison, Digital Ocean specifically limits this clause to uploads on their website (ie, for community articles, forum posts, etc), not for all hosted services (which would include virtual machines, databases, etc).  Additionally, commercialization rights are not granted and it is not perpetual:</p>\n<p>Digital Ocean TOS Excerpt:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We will periodically differentiate between our websites such as digitalocean.com (which we will refer to collectively as the \u201cWebsites\u201d) and all of our other services, such as our cloud infrastructure and other paid services (which we will refer to collectively as the \u201cServices\u201d).</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>By providing your User Content to or via the <strong>Websites</strong>, you grant DigitalOcean a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully paid right and license (with the right to sublicense) to host, store, transfer, display, perform, reproduce, modify for the purpose of formatting for display, and distribute your User Content, in whole or in part, in any media formats and through any media channels.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Though requesting limited permissions for the purposes of user uploads on a forum or other community site is fairly standard, it is not reasonable for a service provider partner to require full, irrevocable commercial rights of anything hosted on their services.  That'd let Vultr take and monetize customer databases, apps, software, etc. which almost every business and personal user would likely find objectionable.  Vultr needs to restrict their request as is done elsewhere in the industry.</p>\n<p>Here is another example -- AWS does not have such broad terms, except for their generative AI product:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>50.12.7. PartyRock Apps. \u201cPartyRock App\u201d means any application created or remixed through PartyRock, including any app snapshot and all corresponding source code. By creating or remixing a PartyRock App, you hereby grant: (a) AWS and its affiliates a worldwide, non-exclusive, fully paid-up, royalty-free license to access, reproduce, prepare derivative works based upon, transmit, display, perform and otherwise exploit your PartyRock App in connection with PartyRock; and (b) anyone who accesses your PartyRock App (\u201cPartyRock Users\u201d), a non-exclusive license to access, reproduce, export, use, prepare derivative works based upon, transmit, and otherwise exploit your PartyRock App for any personal purpose. We may reject, remove, or disable your PartyRock App, PartyRock alias, or PartyRock account at any time for any reason with or without notice to you. You are responsible for your PartyRock Apps, PartyRock Data, and use of your PartyRock Apps, including compliance with the Policies as defined in the Agreement and applicable law. Except as provided in this Section 50.12, we obtain no rights under the Agreement to PartyRock Data or PartyRock Apps. Neither AWS, its Affiliates, nor PartyRock Users have any obligations to make any payments to you in connection with your PartyRock Apps. You will defend and indemnify AWS and its Affiliates for any and all damages, liabilities, penalties, fines, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees) arising out of or in any way related to Your PartyRock Apps or your use of PartyRock. Do not include personally identifying, confidential, or sensitive information in the input that you provide to create or use a PartyRock App.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Note how the license grant doesn't infect the rest of AWS offerings, but is only restricted to their AI product offering \"PartyRock\".  </p>\n<p>It's possible Vultr may want the expansive license grant in order to do AI/Machine Learning based on the data they host.  Or maybe they could mine database contents to resell PII.  Given the (perpetual!) license, there's not really any limit to what they might do.  They could even clone someone's app and sell their own rebranded version, and they'd be legally in the clear.</p>\n<p>I sent my objection to Vultr support, but I've just been getting the run around so far.  I've been trying to get them to at least let me access my account without agreeing to the new TOS so I can migrate out to another provider, but I'm now on day 5 of being locked out with no end in sight.  Migrating all my servers and DNS without being able to login to my account is going to be both a headache and error prone.  I feel like they're holding my business hostage and extorting me into accepting a license I would never consent to under duress.  I'm self employed and the product I host (currently) on Vultr is what pays my rent, so not being able to manage it is a pretty serious concern for me.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I don't know what Vultr's plans are, but I think it's definitely worth pushing back on this overly expansive license grant they're giving to themselves.  If Vultr gets away with it, other cloud providers may try to sneak it into their contracts, too</p>",

The last time we had one was in December, right around the holidays. I hope everyone is doing well and enjoying the early Spring weather.</p>\n<p>It has been a whirlwind of changes to Immich over the past three, almost four months. We pushed out new features and made several breaking changes to bring you the best search experience in the self-hosted photo management space. Yes, we changed our tagline from <strong>backup solution</strong> to <strong>photo and video management solution</strong>.</p>\n<p>Immich has grown exponentially and done more than what the original scopes I had in mind when starting the project, with many contributions from existing and new contributors. The application has improved in all aspects, from adding new features, bug fixing, and refactoring to keep the code base clean to refining our CI/CD pipeline so that the developers get the best feedback when writing code to quickly implement their ideas and the features they want. Immich gets to this point because of the supportive community and the fantastic team behind it; thank you!</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/zdd9ryx8owpc1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=561acfd809d2720d51876f185909a69da0c026fa\">New logo</a></p>\n<p>And yes, we also have a new logo and not-so-ComicSans font to pair with it. I hope you guys like it. Thanks, Matt, again, for the fantastic design.</p>\n<p>Besides the new logo, what else have we done over the last four months? Let's hit on some notable changes from newest to oldest.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We introduced the drag-to-select mechanism on the mobile app to quickly select assets in bulk</li>\n<li>We added OpenTelemetry integration so that you can connect your Prometheus and Grafana dashboards to monitor your instance's performance. To clarify, all of these metrics stay local on your machine.</li>\n<li>We spent much time optimizing library scanning and database query performance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/kckyenucowpc1.png?width=1086&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83f883461436c8578cbfbb49cae005cda058e125\">Enhanced search filters</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>We added a new search filter on the web to search the combination of file name/file extension or semantic/contextual with people, location, camera type, and date range with the various display options. The speed of searching paid off nicely, with the trade-off of the inconvenience of breaking changes. And now the search result isn't limited to 100; we himplemented infinite scroll on those views.</li>\n<li>We implemented a more advanced facial recognition algorithm called DBSCAN. To better understand DBSCAN's work, please watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDZUdRSDOok\">this video</a> for a step-by-step visualization.</li>\n<li>We switched our license from <a href=\"https://github.com/immich-app/immich/discussions/7023\">MIT to AGPLv3</a> with no CLA to ensure the freeness of Immich forever.</li>\n<li>Optimizing rendering and caching on the mobile app so that the browsing and viewing experience is as satisfying as possible.</li>\n<li>You can now specify storage quota for users on your instance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Those are the changes you can easily see; besides that, almost a thousand other contributions further polish the backend and other QoL improvements across the application.</p>\n<p>Some fun metrics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A whooping 293 contributors have contributed code to the project over the past two years</li>\n<li>The Discord community has grown to 6470 members.</li>\n<li>You have sent us almost 8000 stars to gaze on GitHub since December - keep it coming!</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>A few words on breaking changes</h1>\n<p>Even though the team operates on the premises of a very active development project, we have never treated breaking changes lightly. All the breaking changes happen to make Immich better and to fulfill the feature requests that the community has put in. We can't promise that we won't have any more breaking changes in the future because we are not stable yet and are still honing Immich into a diamond of this space. We will make sure to provide you a path of least resistance to update if this to happen again.</p>\n<p>And, yes, you can blame me for the version number. I was a noob (maybe still a noob\ud83d\ude05 ).</p>\n<p>One thing I can promise, though, is that we have a lot of exciting things on the horizon. Let's peek into my list of goals for this year.</p>\n<h1>What is on Alex's list</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Advanced search on the mobile app</li>\n<li>Sub/nested album</li>\n<li>Smart album</li>\n<li>Locked/secured album</li>\n<li>Slideshow on the mobile app</li>\n<li>Perceptual hash search for image similarity grouping</li>\n<li>Automate mobile app deployment pipeline</li>\n<li>Multi-user switcher</li>\n<li>Dynamic time-bucket grouping based on the number of assets in the bucket</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That is not an exhaustive list, and each contributor has their own exciting list. So, I am very excited to see where Immich will be in another year.</p>\n<p>I want to express my deepest gratitude to all the contributors, the core team members, again. I couldn't have done this without you all!</p>\n<p>Thank you and please support the project, with bug reports, discussion, testing and donation.</p>\n<p>Until next time, Alex</p>\n<p>Cheers!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://discord.gg/D8JsnBEuKb\">Discord community</a></p>",

But as you can imagine, I'd like to have access to some services, like Jellyfin or Zabbix from outside, not only from my own network.</p>\n<p>This guide is the result of me searching for the best and most secure solution to that problem. It's not THE BEST, it's not THE MOST SECURE, as always you should use your own head and judgement. But I think for non-critical applications, such as self-hosted Zabbix should be more than fine.</p>\n<p>What will be used here is Cloudflare Zero Trust, which is available for free on Cloudflare account. Note - I know for sure this works if you have domain registered via CF, not sure and no way to check if it's possible with different registrators. </p>\n<p><strong>So first things first - what it is and how it works?</strong> <br />\nI'll explain only bits important for this guide. So we will use Zero Trust Tunnel and Zero Trust Application Access.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Zero Trust Tunnel is essentially a site-to-site VPN between your network and Cloudflare Zero Trust servers. It enables CF to access your resources via local IP address, resolve them and assign them its own public IP. It takes your local IP addresses, creates a CNAME for your domain, then routes all traffic via CF public IPv4 and IPv6 addresses via their proxy to your designated local IPv4 addresses. If you nslookup your hostname, you'll only get CF from their <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/ips/\">IP Ranges</a></li>\n<li>Zero Trust Application Access is a way to secure access to your applications, essentially enforcing going through loops and hoops on CF-hosted authentication page, before you can access even the login screen of your service</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Let's setup a Tunnel</strong><br />\nThe way ZT Tunnel is set up is, you go from your Dashboard to Zero Trust -&gt; Networks -&gt; Tunnels. Here you can find a detailed instruction on how to install and connect <em>cloudflared</em> daemon, that acts as a connector and gateway to your home network. If you use virtualization, like Proxmox, I recommend setting up a small VM/CT, to act as your connector.<br />\nOnce this is set up you Configure it and add <strong>Public Hostname</strong>. Here you can add local IP addresses of your services. And here are some caveats:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You want to select HTTP, not HTTPS. Cloudflare Zero Trust adds its own SSL/TLS reverse proxy, so in the end your services are behind HTTPS. If you have ONLY HTTPS (like with Proxmox) you want to select HTTPS, and in TLS settings enable \"No TLS Verify\" and \"HTTP2 connection\".</li>\n<li>You HAVE to change default port from 80 to something else. For some reason, if your service is hosted on port 80, CF doesn't add it own SSL/TLS (eg. PiHole, where you can easly change it to something like 8100).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now you can access your services from outside with hostnames you set up, but it's still not very secure - if you can access them, everyone can access them. And yes, if you're using a strong, complicated, random password the risk is minimized, but there are still exploits one can use. So let's fortify them further.</p>\n<p><strong>Cloudflare Zero Trust Access - suprisingly strong tool</strong></p>\n<p>Now what Access is I already explained. But what I didn't specify, how powerful it actually is. When you set it up and type in your service URL, you get redirected to <a href=\"https://cloudflareaccess.com\">cloudflareaccess.com</a> domain, requiring you to authenticate. By default you have only access to OTP authentication via e-mail - you type in your email, are sent an access OTP, and only when you type it in, you get access for several minutes/hours/days. However, with ZT Access you have at least for or five levels of authentication:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You can set up multiple authentication methods: OTP, login via numerous sites (Facebook, GitHub, LinkedIn), OAuth2 (Google, Azure, Google Workspaces), OneLogin, OpenID, with timeout spanning from 1 minute to 1 month</li>\n<li>You can restrict who can use these authentication methods, based on their e-mail addess, geolocation, IP range, service token</li>\n<li>You can require user to state a justification on why they want to access the service, with manual review and accept</li>\n<li>You can require using WARP (Cloudflare's own \"sort of VPN\", available at <a href=\"https://1.1.1.1\">1.1.1.1</a>) to even access these authentication methods, and can also be connected with policies and restrictions from point 2</li>\n<li>You can set up multiple WARP client restrictions, like does the user have encrypted hard drive, does it have a particular file, with particular name in specified location on their PC, does the user use WARP as is, or is logged in to your Zero Trust organization</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So you can essentially set up something like \"to access my zabbix, you have to have WARP enabled and logged in into organization, have encrypted hard drive, be located in Germany, your e-mail has to be on <a href=\"https://foo.bar\">foo.bar</a>, and you have to have this picture of a monkey named gibaccess.png on your desktop, then and only then, you can ask me, with proper justification to use your GitHub account to authenticate your access, but only for 1 hour\". Suffice to say... it's powerful.</p>\n<p>Buuuuut for our purpose I think OTP with restriction to only allow a single email address recieve the code will be more than enough. I will not describe the full process, if you self-host you're smart enough to understand what's going on. The most important - you want to create a new Application, select <strong>self-hosted</strong>, add domains from your Tunnel Public Hostnames, and set up policies - bare minimum is <strong><em>Include - Everyone, Require - Emails - your email only</em></strong><em>.</em> <br />\nOnce you set up Application, you have to go back to Tunnels, and reconfigure each Hostname, enabling Access and selecting Application you just created. </p>\n<p>And now when you type in your service URL you'll be thrown into Cloudflare Access page, requiring to type in your email. You can type any email, but if you configured policy correctly, the code will only be sent if you provide your email. It'll take any other email, but won't send code.</p>\n<p><strong>That's all, hope you like it, and have fun using it :)</strong> </p>",

Also being released today is the new, Docker-first <a href=\"https://cardinalapps.io/cardinal-home-server\">Cardinal Home Server</a>, which runs the Photos app, and also runs the upcoming <a href=\"https://cardinalapps.io/cardinal-music\">Music</a> and <a href=\"https://cardinalapps.io/cardinal-cinema\">Cinema</a> apps.</p>\n<p>Work is moving quickly on the platform now that a solid architecture is in place. All of my previous announcements for Cardinal had been for experimental apps, but not this time. What's available today is stable and comes with long term support.</p>\n<p>Download it for free directly on <a href=\"https://hub.docker.com/r/cardinalapps/home-server\">Docker Hub</a>, and check out the website at <a href=\"https://cardinalapps.io\">cardinalapps.io</a> for more info on the platform.

We are open source and our primary objective is to simplify complexity and accelerate the development process.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishing this Goal</h2>\n<p>There are multiple avenues, and I'll highlight just a few:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Instant Local Simulation:</strong></li>\n<li>Visualize, debug, and test apps locally without the need for creating cloud mockups.</li>\n<li><strong>Cloud Services Integration:</strong></li>\n<li>Treats cloud services and distributed computing as integral language primitives.</li>\n<li><strong>Cross-Compilation:</strong></li>\n<li>Compiles to JavaScript and IaC (Terraform and Cloudformation), with support for additional provisioning engines in the pipeline.</li>\n<li><strong>Multi-Cloud Support:</strong></li>\n<li>Code compatibility across different clouds such as AWS, GCP, and Azure.</li>\n<li><strong>Least-Privilege IAM Policies:</strong></li>\n<li>The compiler generates IAM policies and other cloud mechanics based on intent.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.winglang.io/blog/2023/02/17/plugins\"><strong>Compiler Plugins</strong></a><strong>:</strong></li>\n<li>Customize generated infrastructure definitions with ease.</li>\n<li><strong>JavaScript Interoperability:</strong></li>\n<li>Integration with JavaScript.</li>\n<li><strong>Terraform Resource Support:</strong></li>\n<li>Support for any Terraform resource.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Exploring the Language</h2>\n<p>Curious about playing with Winglang? Visit our <a href=\"https://www.winglang.io/play/\">playground</a> to experiment with the code and experience the local simulator in action.</p>\n<h2>Self-Hosting Your Winglang App</h2>\n<p><strong>Local Simulation:</strong> Instantly simulate and test your Winglang application locally without the need for creating cloud mocks. Visualize and debug your app in a controlled environment.</p>\n<p><strong>Deploy on Your Infrastructure:</strong> Once satisfied with your app's functionality, deploy it on your infrastructure. This could be your personal server, a cloud instance, or any environment where you have control.</p>\n<h2>Getting Involved</h2>\n<p>Your feedback is invaluable to us, covering every facet of the project. We're actively seeking developers to become part of our community, contributing their expertise to shape the future of Winglang.</p>\n<p>If Winglang intrigues you, a \u2b50\ufe0f on GitHub would mean the world to us. It helps bring the project to the attention of more developers \ud83d\ude4f, and your support is genuinely appreciated!</p>\n<h2>More Information</h2>\n<p>Explore further details, including how to kickstart your journey with Wing and the rationale behind building it as a language, on our GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/winglang/wing\">Winglang Repository</a>.</p>",

UnRaid's community apps made this whole process much less painful than it otherwise would've been. I was surprised at just how many cloud services I was relying on, so here is how I went about replacing as many of them as I could with FOSS.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Amazon Kindle</strong> - <a href=\"https://github.com/Kareadita/Kavita\">Kavita</a>. <a href=\"https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web\">Calibre-Web</a> was a strong contender here, and still is, but Kavita was fairly painless to setup and use, once I got used to the file structure it requires. It's broad support for different kinds of ebooks, manga, and comics, including PDF style books, won me over quick.</li>\n<li><strong>Google Podcasts</strong> - <a href=\"https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf\">AudioBookShelf</a>. Downloaded images and metadata for my podcasts as well as the automatic downloads I was used to, and has a nice Android app which I've put to good use. Everything worked so well out of the box I didn't bother to research alternatives.</li>\n<li>Audible - Also AudioBookshelf.</li>\n<li><strong>ChatGPT</strong> - <a href=\"https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama\">Ollama</a>. Wonderfully slick UI and easy install, the Ollama UNRAID package ended up seemingly being both lighter and faster than the OobaBooga install I was used to, and it nicely emulates the ChatGPT style interface, allowing you to send images to it for models that support it. OllamaHub even appears to be working to replace custom GPTs.</li>\n<li><strong>Google Drive</strong> - <a href=\"https://github.com/nextcloud/\">NextCloud</a>. Seemed a bit finicky at first, but not entirely their fault. The reverse proxy I had caused errors on larger files, and manually configuring a larger max temp file size finally allowed me to drop in large files as I was used to. Office app integration was a landmine field of suffering, including known performance issues just for having them installed. Ultimately I decided it wasn't worth it, and instead opted for a local LibreOffice install which was synced to the server with NextCloud Files.</li>\n<li><strong>Google Tasks</strong> - Next Cloud Tasks. Not a big task user. Simple was fine.</li>\n<li><strong>Google Photos</strong> - NextCloud again. Worked as a drop in replacement for my purposes. I used the Android app to configure sync on my phone's photos folder and set it to automatically upload over WiFi. The Android Photos app is paid, so instead I still use the google photos app, but with their cloud sync disabled, so nothing is uploaded. Simplistic but does the trick. I strongly considered <a href=\"https://github.com/immich-app/immich\">Immich</a>, but it is reportedly still undergoing rapid development and I wanted something more stable.</li>\n<li><strong>Google Home</strong> - <a href=\"https://github.com/home-assistant\">HomeAssistant</a>. I'm setting up my IoT devices on their own separate VLAN, with all Zigbee devices. I've installed HomeAssistant on a VM instead of a docker because it's easier to manage that way.</li>\n<li><strong>Google Keep</strong> - <a href=\"https://github.com/nextcloud/notes\">NextCloud Notes</a>. Very lightweight, simple note taking app. It supports a nice grid layout too for the full Keep experience as well, and works great for quick reminders, like my grocery list. Most note taking apps seem to use markdown under the hood, so a lot of them are functionally very similar.</li>\n<li><strong>OneNote</strong> - <a href=\"https://github.com/laurent22/joplin\">Joplin</a>. For anything more elaborate, note taking with Joplin worked very well with it's built in rich text editor, and I found it very tweakable with many plugins and extension options for formatting. I highly recommend getting <a href=\"https://github.com/JackGruber/joplin-plugin-backup/\">Simple Backup</a>. What won me over was the ease with which I could copy and paste images into it and have them display on the Android app. I considered Obsidian however I didn't want to pay for sync with a nice free option available instead. Organization similar to OneNote was also very possible with multiple nested notebooks.</li>\n<li><strong>iDrive</strong> - <a href=\"https://github.com/gilbertchen/duplicacy\">Duplicacy</a>. I strongly considered <a href=\"https://github.com/kopia/kopia\">Kopia</a> and Duplicati at first, but Kopia's immaturity as a project and the frequent horror stories I read about Dupliacti led me to Dupliacy. The GUI isn't FOSS but the command line was, and I really appreciated this solution's ability to deduplicate files and cope with my frequent file reorganization without creating needless duplicates inflating my backup size. New revisions take up minimal storage space, and an encrypted repo hosted on Black Blaze B2 provides disaster resilience. I'm also using <a href=\"https://github.com/drakkan/sftpgo\">SFTPGo</a> to securely sync a desktop to the server repo as well.</li>\n<li><strong>LastPass</strong> - <a href=\"https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden\">VaultWarden</a>. The great thing about VaultWarden is you can still use all the great Android and browser apps from BitWarden, but self hosted. Field detection seemed even better than in LastPass, and I was able to migrate everything over without too much trouble, removing many duplicates because VaultWarden supports multiple URI entries and detection schemes.</li>\n<li><strong>Netflix</strong> - <a href=\"https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin\">Jellyfin</a>. I chose Jellyfin over Plex because of the recent controversy surrounding them, and I haven't regretted it. Android and Roku based apps allowed me to use it as a drop in replacement fairly easily, and the range of metadata collection plugins and options allowed me to nicely display my entire diverse library. There's an ecosystem springing up around it with apps like <a href=\"https://github.com/Fallenbagel/jellyseerr\">JellySeerr</a> to make it increasingly competitive as well compared to Plex.</li>\n<li><strong>Amazon Music</strong> - Also Jellyfin, surprisingly. It provides options for instant mixes and selections by genre, album, etc. Some work with <a href=\"https://picard.musicbrainz.org/\">Music Brainz Picard</a> and I began to actually listen to my old music collection again.</li>\n<li><strong>Mint</strong> - <a href=\"https://github.com/firefly-iii/firefly-iii\">Firefly III</a>. I love the graphs on this app and the broad display of information. Also very configurable with rules and webhooks. The <a href=\"https://github.com/firefly-iii/data-importer\">data import tool</a> supports configurable CSV import as well which made getting everything setup easier when I had different formats from different cards. I considered <a href=\"https://github.com/actualbudget/actual\">Actual</a>, which is much more lightweight, but also has fewer features.</li>\n<li><strong>Feedly</strong> - <a href=\"https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS\">FreshRSS</a>. Nicely configurable with plugins and options, I was even able to use <a href=\"https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub\">RSSHub</a> for custom RSS feeds as well to replace some old bookmarks I occasionally monitored.</li>\n<li><strong>PushBullet</strong> - <a href=\"https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy\">Ntfy</a>. I use it to pass links or other info to my phone, occasionally, or just small files I might want if I don't feel like uploading them. On top of being useful as an alert tool if something goes wrong.</li>\n<li><strong>Youtube</strong> - <a href=\"https://github.com/Tzahi12345/YoutubeDL-Material\">YoutubeDL Material</a>. I was able to configure it to automatically download my Youtube Subscriptions, and then using the <a href=\"https://github.com/ankenyr/jellyfin-youtube-metadata-plugin\">JellyFin Youtube MetaData Plugin</a>, label it nicely, rename the file, and prepare it for display on Jellyfin. It also has a browser add-in which allows quickly passing a link to the server instance for downloading videos or just mp3s from a wide variety of sources automatically, which I've also pathed to folders Jellyfin monitors.</li>\n</ul>",

As many of us, I started small. Spawning a first home dashboard and then getting my hands dirty with Docker, Proxmox, DNS, reverse proxying etc. My first hardware was a Raspberry Pi 3. Good times!</p>\n<p>As of today, I am running various dockerized services in my homelab (50+). I have tried K3S but still rock Docker Compose productively and expose everything using Traefik. As the services keep growing and so my `docker-compose.yml` files, I fairly quickly started pushing my configs in a private Gitea repository.</p>\n<p>After a while, I noticed that friends and colleagues constantly reach out to me asking how I run this and that. So as you can imagine, I was quite busy handing over my compose examples as well as cleaning them up for sharing. Especially for those things that are not well documented by the FOSS maintainers itself. As those requests wen't havoc, I started cleaning up my private git repo and creating a public one. For me, for you, for all of us.</p>\n<p>I am sure many of you are aware of the Awesome-Selfhosted repository. It is often referenced in posts and comments as it contains various references to brilliant FOSS, which we all love to host. Today I aligned the readme of my public repo to the awesome-selhosted one. So it should be fairly easy to find stuff as it contains a table of content now.</p>\n<p>Here is the repo with 131 examples and over 3600 stars: </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Haxxnet/Compose-Examples\">https://github.com/Haxxnet/Compose-Examples</a></p>\n<p><strong>Frequently Asked Questions:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>How do you ensure that the provided compose examples are up-to-date?</em></li>\n<li>Many compose examples are run productively by myself. So if there is a major release or breaking code change, I will notice it by myself and update the repo accordingly. For everything else, I try to keep an eye on breaking changes. Sorry for any deprecated ones! If you as the community recognize a problem, please file a GitHub issue. I will then start fixing.</li>\n<li>A GitHub Action also validates each compose yml to ensure the syntax is correct. Therefore, less human error possible when crafting or copy-pasting such examples into the git repo.</li>\n<li><em>I've looked over the repo but cannot find X or Y.</em></li>\n<li>Sorry about that. The repo mostly contains examples I personally run or have run myself. A few of them are contributions from the community. May check out the repo of the maintainer and see whether a compose it provided. If not, create a GitHub issue at my repo and request an example. If you have a working example, feel free to provide it (see next FAQ point though).</li>\n<li><em>How do you select apps to include in your repository?</em></li>\n<li>The initial task was to include all compose examples I personally run. Then I added FOSS software that do not provide a compose example or are quite complex to define/structure/combine. In general, I want to refrain from adding things that are well documented by the maintainers itself. So if you can easily find a docker compose example at the maintainer's repo or public documentation, my repo will likely not add it if currently missing.</li>\n<li><em>What does the compose volume definition `${DOCKER_VOLUME_STORAGE:-/mnt/docker-volumes}` mean?</em></li>\n<li>This is a specific type of <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/compose/environment-variables/env-file/#interpolation\">environment variable definition</a>. It basically searches for a `<em>DOCKER_VOLUME_STORAGE</em>` environment variable on your Docker server. If it is not set, the bind volume mount path with fall-back to the path `/mnt/docker-volumes`. Otherwise, it will use the path set in the environment variable. We do this for many compose examples to have a unified place to store our persisted docker volume data. I personally have all data stored at `/mnt/docker-volumes/<container-stack-name>`. If you don't like this path, just set the env variable to your custom path and it will be overridden.</li>\n<li><em>Why do you store the volume data separate from the compose yaml files?</em></li>\n<li>I personally prefer to separate things. By adhering to separate paths, I can easily push my compose files in a private git repository. By using `git-crypt`, I can easily encrypt `.env` files with my secrets without exposing them in the git repo. As the docker volume data is at a separate Linux file path, there is no chance I accidentially commit those into my repo. On the other side, I have all volume data at one place. Can be easily backed up by Duplicati for example, as all container data is available at `/mnt/docker-volumes/`.</li>\n<li><em>Why do you put secrets in the compose file itself and not in a separate `.env`?</em></li>\n<li>The repo contains examples! So feel free to harden your environment and separate secrets in an env file or platform for secrets management. The examples are scoped for beginners and intermediates. Please harden your infrastructure and environment.</li>\n<li><em>Do you recommend Traefik over Caddy or Nginx Proxy Manager?</em></li>\n<li>Yes, always! Traefik is cloud native and explicitely designed for dockerized environments. Due to its labels it is very easy to expose stuff. Furthermore, we proceed in infrastructure as code, as you just need to define some labels in a `docker-compose.yml` file to expose a new service. I started by using Nginx Proxy Manager but quickly switched to Traefik.</li>\n<li><em>What services do you run in your homelab?</em></li>\n<li>Too many likely. Basically a good subset of those in the public GitHub repo. If you want specifics, ask in the comments.</li>\n<li><em>What server(s) do you use in your homelab?</em></li>\n<li>I opted for a single, power efficient NUC server. It is the HM90 EliteMini by Minisform. It runs Proxmox as hypervisor, has 64GB of RAM and a virtualized TrueNAS Core VM handles the SSD ZFS pool (mirror). The idle power consumption is about 15-20 W. Runs rock solid and has enough power for multiple VMs and nearly all selfhosted apps you can imagine (except for those AI/LLMS etc.).</li>\n</ul>",

I've started hosting many of my own services thanks to the advice and ideas here. I'm also security conscious, so one thing has me increasingly uneasy is how vocal people are about Tailscale as a good solution for \"self hosting\". I used Tailscale for a few months, but never found it quite as magical as some people seem to. Then, there was a post in December (<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/18evofr/a_word_of_caution_about_tailscale/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/18evofr/a_word_of_caution_about_tailscale/</a>) that raised this point and led to a really good discussion, and I decided it wasn't a good fit for me.</p>\n<p>I understand that Tailscale is easy to use, trusting them with everything just doesn't feel right to me. They are a business (with VCs to answer to), not a charity. Sometimes incentives like this are okay, but as an example, I don't want to think about Google having access to my email, so I don't use Gmail anymore. I know enough to understand that they can't simply read my network traffic, but they control the keys to every host, and even more importantly they will have a lot of metadata about me, and where I connect from.  </p>\n<p>And that brings me to the reason I finally decided to post something about this.. I happened across this job listing, and it is exactly the kind of thing that makes me uneasy about ever trusting a seemingly well-intentioned company: <a href=\"https://echojobs.io/job/tailscale-data-software-engineer-3rqib\">https://echojobs.io/job/tailscale-data-software-engineer-3rqib</a> This all but confirms they are data mining their users (or plan to), and I just want to make people aware of what they are signing up for here.  </p>\n<p>Am I overreacting? Maybe. But I really just don't like the idea of trading one big brother for another, and giving up yet another bit of privacy, which is already extremely difficult to maintain these days.</p>",

I am pleased to finally show the world <a href=\"https://github.com/reaper47/recipya\">Recipya</a>, the recipe manager software I have been working hard on since my first commit in May 2021. You might wonder why another recipes manager when we've got <a href=\"https://github.com/TandoorRecipes/recipes\">Tandoor</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/mealie-recipes/mealie\">Mealie</a>, <a href=\"https://www.paprikaapp.com/\">Paprika</a>, <a href=\"https://grocy.info/\">Grocy</a>, <a href=\"https://cooklist.com/\">Cooklist</a>, <a href=\"https://grossr.com/\">Grossr</a>, and a <a href=\"https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted#recipe-management\"><em>whole lot more</em></a>? The answer is simple: none of them satisfied my needs. Either they weren't free and opensource, had too many features I did not need, their frontend was slow, or they were too hard to install. Although I do have to admit Tandoor recipes is the king after having discovered it a few months back.</p>\n<p>And thus I started this ambitious project in <a href=\"https://go.dev\">Go</a>. The goal was to create a simple, clean and powerful recipe manager my whole family can enjoy. As with every other such solution, you can add recipes to your ever-growing collection of recipes, create cookbooks, view and print recipes. One big feature that Recipya from the others is its measurement systems module. Essentially, the software can convert all new recipes to your preferred measurement system, either the insatiable imperial or the mighty metric. Gone are the times when you convert all your teaspoons and cups to grams. Another powerful feature is the website scraper. Most other solutions are written in Python and thus use the <a href=\"https://github.com/hhursev/recipe-scrapers\">hhursev/recipe-scrapers</a> package to import recipes from around the web. As there are none written in Go, I decided to create <a href=\"https://github.com/reaper47/recipya/tree/main/internal/scraper\">my own</a> from scratch. It is extensively-tested and fully supports <a href=\"https://github.com/reaper47/recipya/blob/main/internal/services/migrations/20230522154229_websites.sql#L11\">264</a> websites at the time of this writing. Another cool feature of Recipya is the automatic calculation of the nutrition facts per 100g when adding a recipe. Check out the <a href=\"https://recipes.musicavis.ca/guide/docs/features/\">feature tour</a> to learn everything the software can do.</p>\n<p>Please give it a try! No worries if this software isn't for you :) The easiest way is to try the <a href=\"https://recipes.musicavis.ca\">demo</a>. Other ways include installing the <a href=\"https://recipes.musicavis.ca/guide/docs/installation/build/\">v1.0.0 release</a> locally or with <a href=\"https://recipes.musicavis.ca/guide/docs/installation/docker/\">Docker</a>. You can follow the installation <a href=\"https://recipes.musicavis.ca/guide/docs/installation/\">instructions</a>.</p>\n<p>And this marks the beginning of Recipya's journey. Contributions are <a href=\"https://recipes.musicavis.ca/guide/about/community-guide/\">encouraged and welcome</a>. The roadmap is available <a href=\"https://recipes.musicavis.ca/guide/about/roadmap/\">here</a>. Thank you!</p>",

I know privacy and security are essential to this subreddit, and they're very important to me as well. </p>\n<p><strong>Homeway has a very strong</strong> <a href=\"https://learn.homeway.io/privacy/\">privacy</a> <strong>and</strong> <a href=\"https://learn.homeway.io/security\">security</a> <strong>commitment; we will never sell, store, or give away your data.</strong> Homeway tunnels your data from your browser to your Home Assistant and back, then it's deleted. All of your data stays locally in your home, I'm just building a secure way to access it. I have written an <a href=\"https://learn.homeway.io/security\">extensive page describing our system security</a>; I would like feedback and scrutiny!</p>\n<p>There are other remote access solutions, but I'm trying to build an easy-as-possible-to-use system that requires no setup, so there's no way to misconfigure the system and expose it to the public internet. I have worked in software and security for 10 years, so I have seen the user benefits of systems that are drop-dead easy to set up and have seen the horrors of security issues resulting from poor attention to security.</p>\n<p>I want the service to be free so that as many people can secure their Home Assistant remote access. However, the service does cost money to operate, so users can opt into an option supporter role for $2.49/month, which helps fund the project. If you get the supporter role, you get higher limits on your data usage as a thank-you.</p>\n<p><strong>I'm looking for beta testers to run the project through its paces and send feedback</strong>. I'm an open book and would love to communicate with anyone on their thoughts, concerns, bugs, or whatever. For this initial set of beta testers, if you contribute feedback, as a thank you, <strong>I will give all beta testers \"Supporter Perks\" for life, essentially meaning unlimited free remote access forever.</strong></p>\n<p>If you're interested, <a href=\"https://homeway.io/getstarted?source=reddit_selfhost\">follow this link to get set up in about 20 seconds</a>. All you have to do is install the Homeway add-on and link your account.</p>\n<p>I'm excited to get some users into my project and see what you all think! I'm more than happy to answer any questions, fire away!</p>",

This was my post: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/18gh5oy/do_you_selfhost_git_repos_too/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/18gh5oy/do_you_selfhost_git_repos_too/</a>. I had mentioned that initially I got bashed for building a GUI tool and I got very kind responses on the post which encouraged me to keep doing what I love to do!</p>\n<p>Quite a few mentioned that they cannot use my tool as it is not open-source. I am happy to announce that I have open-sourced it under <strong>MIT License</strong> and here is the repo:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/productiveops/dokemon\">https://github.com/productiveops/dokemon</a></p>\n<p><strong>Why it was not open-source earlier?</strong></p>\n<p>I used to be a .NET developer before I moved into DevOps. The project started as an excuse for me to learn the latest development technologies. Dokemon is written in Golang and React. One reason I had not open-sourced it earlier was I am new to both these languages/frameworks and I was nervous of people judging my code. :) It is not that bad but still it made me nervous.</p>\n<p>I had planned to complete all the basic functionality, then refactor the code, then setup coding standards, etc. and then open-source it. I have not reached this stage yet, but as many cannot use it for not being open-source, I gathered courage and decided to open-source it right away! I will slowly keep on building it and refactoring the code as I go along.</p>\n<p>After my previous post I added a few new features: support for Variables and Environments and Dark Mode! :)</p>\n<p>Here is repo once again:</p>\n<p><strong>Dokemon Code Repo</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/productiveops/dokemon\">https://github.com/productiveops/dokemon</a></p>\n<p>Do give it a STAR on GitHub if you like the project :)</p>",

The project has grown so much in terms of users, developers, features, maturity, and the community around it. When I started working on Immich, it was simply a challenge for myself and an opportunity to learn new technologies, crafting something fun and useful for my wife during my free time to satisfy my urge to build and create things. I never thought it would become so popular and help so many people. At the end of the day, all we have is memory. I am proud that the team and I have created something to make storing and viewing those precious memories easier without restrictions and without sacrificing our privacy. As the year closes, here\u2019s a recap of everything the project accomplished in 2023.</p>\n<p>Milestones</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Public shared links</li>\n<li>Favorites page</li>\n<li>Immich turned 1</li>\n<li>Material Design 3 on the mobile app</li>\n<li>Auto-link LivePhotos server-side</li>\n<li>iOS background backup</li>\n<li>Explore page</li>\n<li>CLIP search</li>\n<li>Search by metadata</li>\n<li>Responsive web app</li>\n<li>Archive page</li>\n<li>Asset descriptions</li>\n<li>10,000 stars on GitHub</li>\n<li>Manage auth devices</li>\n<li>Map view</li>\n<li>Facial recognition, clustering, searching, renaming, and person management</li>\n<li>Partner sharing and unifying timeline between partners' users</li>\n<li>Custom storage label</li>\n<li>XMP sidecar reading</li>\n<li>RAW file formats</li>\n<li>Justified layout on the web</li>\n<li>Memories</li>\n<li>Multi-select via SHIFT</li>\n<li>Android Motion Photos</li>\n<li>360\u00b0 Photos</li>\n<li>Album description</li>\n<li>Album performance improvements (time buckets)</li>\n<li>Video hardware transcoding</li>\n<li>Slideshow mode on the web</li>\n<li>Configuration file</li>\n<li>External libraries</li>\n<li>Trash page</li>\n<li>Custom theme</li>\n<li>Asset Stacking</li>\n<li>20,000 stars on GitHub </li>\n<li>Shared album activity and comments</li>\n<li>CLI v2</li>\n<li>Down to 5 containers (from 8)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Fun Statistics</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We have gone from the release version `1.41.0` to `1.90.0` at the time of writing.

Bugs will continue to be squashed and conquered. \u201cShit Alex wrote'' code will continue to be replaced by beautiful, clean code from Jason, Zack, Boet, Daniel, Osorin, Mert, Fynn, Marty, Martin, and Jonathan. The team has my eternal gratitude for creating a welcoming environment for new contributors, helping, teaching, and learning from each other. I\u2019ve realized that hardly a day has gone by where the team hasn\u2019t been in communication about Immich related topics over the past year.</p>\n<p>My long-term goal is to help hone Immich into a diamond in the FOSS space, where the UI, UX, development experiences, documentation, and quality are at a high standard while remaining free for everybody to use.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy Immich and have a happy and peaceful holiday.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Alex and the Immich Team</p>\n<p>Cheers! \ud83c\udf86\ud83c\udf86</p>",

With a simple change to their TOS this company can do all sorts of things, including charging for a previously free product or monetizing whatever data that can get from you.</p>\n<p>If there's one thing that we should all already know about VC funded internet startups, it's that they can and will pull the rug from underneath you when their bottom line demands it. See: streaming services cutting content while raising costs, sites like youtube and reddit redesigning to add more and more ads, hashicorp going from open source to close source. There's countless others. </p>\n<p>In the beginning there is often a honey moon period when a company is flush from cash from VC rounds and is in a \"growth at all costs\" mentality where they essentially subsidize the cost of services for new users and often offer things like a free tier. This is where Tailscale is today. Over time they eventually shift into a profit mentality when they've shored up as much of the market as they can (which Tailscale has already done a great job of).</p>\n<p>I'm not saying don't use Tailscale, or that it's a bad service (on the contrary their product UX is incredible and you can't get better than free), just that it's praise in this subreddit feels misplaced. Relying on a software-as-a-service company for your networking feels very much against the philosophy of self hosting.</p>",

I connected the Firestick and my other devices to the router before I left. At the hotel, I plugged my router in, connected it the wifi, and all my devices were then connected. I then was able to seamlessly stream directly from my home server using jellyfin and tailscale. It was awesome.</p>",

The process requires mastering various layers of the cloud stack, IAM roles, networking, and numerous tools, along with finding creative ways to test and debug code. In addition, long deployment times hinder iteration cycles and take me out of my creative flow.</p>\n<p>Other development disciplines have benefited from smart compilers that handle the lower levels of the stack and reduce developers' cognitive load. With Wing, we aim to bring the same benefits to cloud development with a language that treats the entire cloud as its target computer.</p>\n<h1>How to get Involved</h1>\n<p>We'd love to hear your feedback on any aspect of the project, and we're looking for developers to join our community to help shape Winglang's future.</p>\n<p>If you find Winglang interesting, please <a href=\"https://github.com/winglang/wing\">give us a \u2b50\ufe0f</a> on GitHub to bring the project to the attention of more developers \ud83d\ude4f. Your support is greatly appreciated!</p>\n<p>More Info</p>\n<p>You can find more info, including how to get started with Wing and why we're building it as a language, in our GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/winglang/wing\">https://github.com/winglang/wing</a>.</p>",

I worked on a beautiful UI like SendGrid and MailGun for more than six months. I plan to start a transactional email service.</p>\n<p>I bought a range and rented another /24 range because I didn't want to have a bad neighbour on the subnet. I even got my own ASN because jerks like UCEProtect often put big ISPs on a blacklist at the ASN level.</p>\n<p>Of course, I have got a decent\u00a0experience with this. I wrote my own SMTP server, email routing, and other things such as bounce and suppression handling. In a sense, everything is fine. RDNS, DKIM, DMARC, and SPF.</p>\n<p>I know that IP needs to warm up, so that's where I started. I paid for a few services to help me warm up, and it took me about two months to do so. Okay so far. The email was delivered 100% of the time to Gmail, but not at all to Yahoo and Outlook. The delivery rate to these two companies started to get better around last week, though. Some IP addresses started getting a 100% delivery rate.</p>\n<p>Then, I started testing my service on one of my websites. Of course, 100% transactional emails with account confirmation links ONLY. It was working great. Nearly 2,000 emails, 3,000+ opens and about 2,500 clicks daily on an average.</p>\n<p>I've also subscribed to Glock Apps and MXToolbox to measure my email deliverability and monitor IPs.</p>\n<p>Just today, I received an email with all half of my active IP addresses and sending/tracking domain blacklisted by Spamhaus. They categorize it under \"spam domain\", but I looked through my server logs (yes, everything is logged) and found no evidence of spam. Only transactional and warmup emails sent. I opened a ticket with Spamhaus and refuse to unblock my IP addresses and domains.</p>\n<p>I spent 6 months and $20,000+ working on this, only to be butchered by Spamhaus. How can Spamhaus be the police, judge and the executioner?</p>",

I discovered this do-it-yourself VPN solution about half a year ago and boy has it improved my life... Here is what I managed to accomplish with it.</p>\n<p>I am running Tailscale on my old macbook air, henceforth referred to as my \"server\", my two firesticks, and my phones.</p>\n<p>*remotely=outside of LAN, so over internet*</p>\n<p>-I can access my SMB shares remotely from my phones with OwlFiles and from my M1 Macbook air seamlessly through Finder. All I had to do was enter a simple command on my server in Terminal to add TCP/445 to \"Services\". Tailscale then forwards incoming TCP connections on port 445 from within my tailnet to port 445 on my mac\u2019s server. The result is that I am able to mount my 2TB share from anywhere I have internet and manage my files as though I was on my home network. I also have access to my entire media library from VLC installed on all my devices (once again, through SMB). If only I could somehow add my remote SMB shares to Kodi... But Kodi doesn't seem to allow me to type in custom IP addresses when trying to add SMB shares. Let me know in the comments if you know how to add remote SMB shares to Kodi (the ones it does not detect automatically).</p>\n<p>-Similarly, by adding a suitable HTTPS port to my server's Tailscale services, I am able to manage the Transmission torrent client installed on my server remotely through Transmission's web interface (while connected to Tailscale, of course).</p>\n<p>-I can back up to Time Machine remotely and accessing my Time Machine backups remotely as well. There are a few caveats though. On my server, I had to add a shared folder (from Settings), allow access to it via SMB and mark it as a Time Machine backup destination. The process is pretty straightforward. The trick is to add it as a backup destination THROUGH TAILSCALE by typing in the Tailscale IP of your server or the Magic-DNS domain name. Also, you will not be able to access pre-existing time machine backups through Tailscale! Only the destinations that you initially add through Tailscale. This is why I have two backup destinations on my server - one that I back up to from my LAN and one that I use over Tailscale remotely. Works like a charm!!!</p>\n<p>-I can control my server through VNC remotely and seamlessly as if I was connected to LAN. To do that, I had to add TCP/5900 to my server's Tailscale services (which is akin to opening up TCP port 5900 to incoming connections from within the tailnet). This is particularly useful when I don't have my M1 mac with me, but need to run Python code inside Spyder. I just turn on my bluetooth/trackpad combo, connect it to my S10+, jack myself into my tailnet, MultiVNC my way into my server and BAM.</p>\n<p>-MagicDNS deserves its own praiseful review. Not only did it assign a permanent, simple domain name to all my Tailscale-enabled devices, but it allowed me to configure my own DNS server for Tailscale-connected devices. I was then able to choose custom DNS servers for specific domains, which let me block FireTV updates without compromising my security (The DNS server used for that looks a little sketchy so I don\u2019t want all of my DNS requests to go through it) and also use AdGuard DNS without breaking Doordash\u2019s Dasher app by routing doordash-specific DNS requests to Google\u2019s DNS and not AdGuard\u2019s. Solid win here, as Adguard's DNS bricks the Dasher app. Let me know in the comments if you want to see my Magic-DNS configuration.</p>\n<p>-FUNNEL: By running a funnel (proxy) on my home server, I am able to access my dad's Bell Fibe TV channels through their web interface from anywhere on Earth - Bell treats my traffic as if it's coming from my home network! It will NOT work if you use the mobile app, but works flawlessly from within Samsung Internet, Safari (on mac) and Grazing 3 (on iOS). Also, it\u2019s quite neat to browse with my Canadian IP even when I am travelling (no more annoying \"cookie consent\" notices when in the EU). I suspect Netflix users could use this sort of setup to get around password-sharing restrictions. I am also running funnels on my firesticks just in case I need more bandwidth.</p>\n<p>-SUBNETS: I am running a subnet on my home server so that I could adb into my firesticks and manage them remotely with scrcpy (update apps, install tweaks, etc). Yes, I am not a huge fan of the command line \\^\\^' . I can also access my wifi cameras remotely from my mac. The desktop app for the cheap chinese ones only allows you to manage them over LAN, but Tailscale takes care of that. Works like a charm!</p>\n<p>I am beyond pleased with everything Tailscale enables me to do. It baffles me that this technology is somehow free to use. I am extremely grateful to be a part of the Tailscale community. Thank you!!</p>\n<p>Share your ideas and questions in the comments.</p>",

Even though I tried many options, none of them really appealed to me. The built-in bookmark managers in browsers were too basic and didn't allow me to organize my bookmarks in a way that made sense to me. The most popular external bookmark managers have been too simple, too complicated, or too expensive for what they offer.</p>\n<p>What I liked the most was the idea of having a bookmark manager with a relational database I had access to. This would let me retrieve my bookmarks in any way I wanted, and I could easily add new features in the future. I've searched for a solution that would allow me to do that, but I couldn't find anything that would fit my needs.</p>\n<p>And that's how the idea of the Grimoire was born. I wanted to create a bookmark manager that would be simple to use, but also powerful enough to let me organize my bookmarks in a way that made sense to me. Moreover, I wanted to take SvelteKit and PocketBase for a spin, and this seemed like a perfect opportunity to do so.</p>\n<h2>How it looks now<a href=\"https://grimoire.pro/blog/launch-time#how-it-looks-now\">\u200b</a></h2>\n<p>Starting with v0.1.0, Grimoire has most of the basic features you would expect from a bookmark manager:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>bookmarks:</li>\n<li>can be added, viewed, edited, and deleted</li>\n<li>can be organized into categories and tagged</li>\n<li>metadata, like title, description, HTML content, favicon, and image, is fetched from the website and stored locally</li>\n<li>can have notes added to them</li>\n<li>bookmark list:</li>\n<li>display in a grid or list view</li>\n<li>can be searched by title, description, URL, and tags</li>\n<li>filtering by category, tag, and and more</li>\n<li>sort by date added, domain, and more</li>\n<li>users:</li>\n<li>can sign up and sign in</li>\n<li>all bookmarks, categories, and tags are private to the user</li>\n<li>admin panel:</li>\n<li>is used to manage users and see their bookmark, category, and tag counts</li>\n<li>can be used to preview most of PocketBase settings</li>\n<li>other:</li>\n<li>it's dockerized, so it's easy to run it locally or deploy it to your server</li>\n<li>all the benefits of a self-hosted PocketBase installation, like scheduled backups (local and to S3), high performance, and data security</li>\n<li>dark mode, because dark wizardry requires darkness</li>\n<li>responsive design as magic should be accessible to everyone, everywhere</li>\n<li>early and experimental support for AI-powered features (more on that in the future), like automatic tag suggestions</li>\n<li>and that's just the beginning!</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What's next<a href=\"https://grimoire.pro/blog/launch-time#whats-next\">\u200b</a></h2>\n<p>It's still a work in progress, but I'm happy with the functionality provided so far. You can expect more useful features, like a way to import bookmarks from other services and export them to most popular file formats, public profiles, better admin panel, AI-powered features - just to name a few.

I loved Spore, from the time I got it for my 10th birthday to maybe the age of 16 or 17 I poured hundreds or probably thousands of hours into this game. As I got older I became less invested in the gameplay and more invested in the creative aspect of it. I designed some badass creatures and spaceships that I was really proud of. I had a whole line of Spaceships that all served different roles in my head cannon, with different races of aliens following different themes. </p>\n<p>EA/Maxis/whoever runs Spore now purged all of them from spore.com, and now they're gone.

To be clear, this is Plex telling other people what I've been watching from <em>my</em> server, with <em>my</em> files, and this is not OK. It also shows me what <em>they</em> have been watching on <em>their</em> server with <em>their</em> files. <strong>This is not OK!</strong></p>\n<p>https://imgur.com/a/DYR4wlh</p>\n<p>We all knew it was a matter of time before Plex started collecting data on our libraries and sharing it with advertisers. What happened to their \"we don't know, and don't want to know, what is on your server\"?. This, for me, is proof that those fears were absolutely founded in reality. On what planet would I ever want this information to be shared with friends on family on an OPT OUT basis? </p>\n<p>It's totally unacceptable to collect this data in the first place. It's totally unacceptable to share this information with uniquely identifiable information. And it's totally unacceptable to do this without explicitly asking me if it's OK. </p>\n<p>Unfortunately there is nothing you can do about this as a server admin, because technically these are <em>Plex</em> users and their marketing email preferences are controlled on the user side in the Plex website preferences. Not on your server.</p>\n<p><strong>This is an absolutely egregious overreach.</strong></p>\n<p>Thank goodness there are alternatives available in the form of Jellyfin and Emby. I left my Plex server up after the Jellyfin January challenge we did on the Self-Hosted podcast but because of this I feel that I have no choice but to take it down for good.</p>",

This is very unfortunate for me because I was running a bunch of volunteer community projects on there and really liked how they didn't hide SSO behind a paywall. Not everyone using apps like these are companies trying to save money and having to pay $5 per user isn't feasible for volunteer projects that don't have any money to begin with.  </p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://budibase.com/blog/updates/pricing-v3/\">https://budibase.com/blog/updates/pricing-v3/</a></p>",

It is a big gift for me, thank you everyone! Uptime Kuma V2 is still under development, stay tuned!</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>",
