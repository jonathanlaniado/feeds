Unless you have a whole DevOps team,\nit usually brings more problems than benefits, and unnecessary infrastructure bills\nburied a lot of startups before they got anywhere.</p>\n<p>As for prerequisites, you can't be a complete beginner in the world of computers.\nIf you've never even heard of Docker, if you don't know at least something about DNS,\nor if you don't have any experience with Linux, this course is probably not for you.\nThat being said, I do explain the basics too, but probably not in enough detail\nfor a complete beginner.</p>\n<p>The course is available at Udemy, and here's a 100% OFF coupon URL (1000 of those available):</p>\n<p>https://www.udemy.com/course/real-world-devops-project-from-start-to-finish/?couponCode=FREEDEVOPS2211CJDUA</p>\n<p>Be sure to BUY the course for $0, and not sign up for Udemy's subscription plan.\nThe Subscription plan is selected by default, but you want the BUY checkbox.\nIf you see a price other than $0, chances are that all coupons have been used already.</p>\n<p>I encourage you to watch \"free preview\" videos to get the sense of what\nwill be covered, but here's the gist:</p>\n<p>The goal of the course is to create an easily deployable and reproducible server\nwhich will have \"everything\" a startup or a small company will need - VPN, mail, Git,\nCI/CD, messaging, hosting websites and services, sharing files, calendar, etc.\nIt can also be useful to individuals who want to self-host all of those - I ditched Google 99.9%\nand other than that being a good feeling, I'm not worried that some AI bug will lock my account\nwith no one to talk to about resolving the issue.</p>\n<p>Considering that it covers a wide variety of topics, it doesn't go in depth in any of those.\nThink of it as going down a highway towards the end destination, but on the way there I show you\nall the junctions where I think it's useful to do more research on the subject.</p>\n<p>We'll deploy services inside Docker and LXC (Linux Containers). Those will include\na mail server (iRedMail), Zulip (Slack and Microsoft Teams alternative), GitLab (with GitLab Runner and CI/CD),\nNextcloud (file sharing, calendar, contacts, etc.), checkmk (monitoring solution), Pi-hole (ad blocking on DNS level),\nTraefik with Docker and file providers (a single HTTP/S entry point with automatic routing and TLS certificates).</p>\n<p>We'll set up WireGuard, a modern and fast VPN solution for secure access to VPS' internal network,\nand I'll also show you how to get a wildcard TLS certificate with certbot and DNS provider.</p>\n<p>To wrap it all up, we'll write a simple Python application that will compare a list of the desired backups\nwith the list of finished backups, and send a result to a Zulip stream.\nWe'll write the application, do a 'git push' to GitLab which will trigger a CI/CD pipeline\nthat will build a Docker image, push it to a private registry, and then,\nwith the help of the GitLab runner, run it on the VPS and post a result to a Zulip stream with a webhook.</p>\n<p>When done, you'll be equipped to add additional services suited for your needs.</p>\n<p>If you apply the coupon, I'd appreciate if you leave your feedback on Udemy\nafter you're done and spread the word about the course. It would mean a lot.</p>\n<p>I hope that you find it useful.</p>\n<p>Happy learning,\nPredrag</p></div>",

I've mentioned it sometimes in comments, but until now have never felt like it was polished enough to make a post about it.</p>\n<p>KitchenOwl is a cross-platform app with a self-hosted backend. Everything is shared between users, be it recipes, shopping lists, or expenses. It tries to suggest recipes you haven't cooked in a while and adapt to the typical order in which you remove items from the grocery list.</p>\n<p>If you're interested take a quick look at page linked above, there you can find some screenshots and a full list of features.</p>\n<h2>Why did I create KitchenOwl?</h2>\n<p>Me and my roommates always used bring! to keep track of what groceries we needed. Since we also heavily relied on recipes to plan what to cook we wanted to have a common list of recipes and what we needed for them. Bring! only allows to store recipes for yourself and not have a shared list. That's when I looked for self-hosted grocery lists and recipe managers. There where many which I liked like Mealie and Tandoor. But none of them had quite the same capabilities when it came to shopping lists. That's when I decided to just create my own app.</p>\n<p>It started rather basic with just a clone of Bring! but since then I added many many features and functionalities.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Feel free to ask me any questions in the comments.</p></div>",

I wanted a single (private) location to store our medical records, and I just couldn't find any software that worked as I'd like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>self-hosted/offline - this is my medical history, I'm not willing to give it to some random multi-national corporation to data-mine and sell</li>\n<li>It should aggregate my data from multiple healthcare providers (insurance companies, hospital networks, clinics, labs) across multiple industries (vision, dental, medical) -- all in one dashboard</li>\n<li>automatic - it should pull my EMR (electronic medical record) directly from my insurance provider/clinic/hospital network - I dont want to scan/OCR physical documents (unless I have to)</li>\n<li>open source - the code should be available for contributions &amp; auditing</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, I built it</p>\n<p><strong>Fasten is an open-source, self-hosted, personal/family electronic medical record aggregator, designed to integrate with 1000's of insurances/hospitals/clinics</strong></p>\n<p>Here's a couple of screenshots that'll give you an idea of what it looks like:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/vfgojBD\">Fasten Screenshots</a></p>\n<p>It's pretty basic right now, but it's designed with a easily extensible core around a solid foundation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Self-hosted</li>\n<li>Designed for families, not Clinics (unlike OpenEMR and other popular EMR systems)</li>\n<li>Supports the Medical industry's (semi-standard) FHIR protocol </li>\n<li>Uses OAuth2 (Smart-on-FHIR) authentication (no passwords necessary)</li>\n<li>Uses OAuth's <code>offline_access</code> scope (where possible) to automatically pull changes/updates</li>\n<li>Multi-user support for household/family use</li>\n<li>(Future) Dashboards &amp; tracking for diagnostic tests</li>\n<li>(Future) Integration with smart-devices &amp; wearables</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>What about HIPAA?</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://aspe.hhs.gov/report/health-insurance-portability-and-accountability-act-1996\">Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)</a>, Public Law 104-191, included Administrative Simplification provisions that required HHS to adopt national standards for electronic health care transactions and code sets, unique health identifiers, and security. At the same time, Congress recognized that advances in electronic technology could erode the privacy of health information. Consequently, Congress incorporated into HIPAA provisions that mandated the adoption of Federal privacy protections for individually identifiable health information.</p>\n<p>https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/index.html</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Most of us are aware that HIPAA ensures that our medical data stays private and protected. However you may not be aware that HIPAA also guarantees Rights of Access to individuals. Basically you have access to your data, and you can do with it what you'd like. (Including storing it on your home server!)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Privacy Rule, a Federal law, gives you rights over your health information and sets rules and limits on who can look at and receive your health information. The Privacy Rule applies to all forms of individuals' protected health information, whether electronic, written, or oral. The Security Rule is a Federal law that requires security for health information in electronic form.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>So where can you download and try out Fasten?</strong></p>\n<p>Unfortunately Fasten is still a bit of a pipedream.</p>\n<p>Don't get me wrong, it works &amp; is able to connect to sandbox acccounts of many large insurance providers, however given the security &amp; privacy postures of most Healthcare companies, they require registered corporate identification numbers for anyone who'd like to access their production systems. This is something I'm considering, so please keep reading.</p>\n<p><strong>I want to play with Fasten, but I don't want to share my real data</strong></p>\n<p>I have a (closed-source) \"Demo\" version available, with access to Sandbox accounts on multiple Insurance providers, all populated with synthetic/generated patient data.</p>\n<p>If there's enough interest, I'm happy to release this version for you all to test out and give feedback, without worrying about sharing your medical history with a closed-source app just to test it. </p>\n<p><strong>How do we make this happen?</strong></p>\n<p>Before I take Fasten any further, I need to guage the community's interest, and figure out a monization model to support the legal, security and company overhead.</p>\n<p>I'd prefer to keep Fasten open source, but at the very least it'll be source-available. </p>\n<p>Fasten will never sell your data (primarily because I won't have access to it, but mostly because its sleazy), so the monitization model may be via donations, licensing specific features or charging for distribution/updates.  </p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>This is where you come in. I need feedback, lots of it.</strong></p>\n<p>I created a Google Form, and I'd appreciate it if you all filled it out and gave me some indication if this is worthwhile and what kind of monetization model we should follow. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://forms.gle/HqxLL23jxRWvZLKY6\">https://forms.gle/HqxLL23jxRWvZLKY6</a></p>\n<p>Thanks!!</p></div>",

I apologize for the late update. August had been a very productive month for the project and the team. I hope you all had a great one as well.</p>\n<p>As always, you can find the project here <a href=\"https://github.com/immich-app/immich\">https://github.com/immich-app/immich</a></p>\n<p>The team and I have implemented some exciting features (Version v1.27) that I hope you enjoy.</p>\n<h2>Background upload (Android)</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/k32ju7gvi9m91.png?width=237&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f09f56a23820dd565fed44385adb1316a651a327\">Background backup option</a></p>\n<p>We have implemented the background upload mechanism on Android. You can toggle the option from the upload page, and off you go! The newly taken photos and videos in your selected albums will now be uploaded automatically to the Immich server. This has been a highly requested feature, and I am happy we have implemented a part of it. We are still looking to improve this feature, so your feedback and bug report is appreciated.</p>\n<p>iOS users, myself included, don't have this feature yet. I am looking forward to implementing this tricky part on iOS.</p>\n<h2>Deduplication</h2>\n<p>Yep, we finally implemented this feature. So no more duplicated files on your instance.</p>\n<h2>Virtual scroll on the web</h2>\n<p>Since the beginning, It is always my concern about the naive implementation of getting loading the photos and videos on the web, we were simply fetching all the assets metadata and painting all the placeholder boxes on the screen. So, the browser crashes if you have more than 50_000 boxes painted. Also, the initial load time will be a century long which will cause a bad user experience.</p>\n<p>Thankfully we have a pointer from the Google Photos frontend engineer who designed and implemented the timeline. You can find more information in the article <a href=\"https://medium.com/google-design/google-photos-45b714dfbed1\">Building the Google Photos Web UI</a>. In short, the timeline is calculated based on the number of assets the user has. Then from the scroll position, the viewport will be calculated, and then getting the data that should be in the viewport, finally paint the thumbnail with time group information. So regardless of having millions of photos and videos, the app will only see what can fit in the viewport. This will help users with hundreds of thousands of photos in their storage.</p>\n<p>I am excited about this feature. Without this, we cannot scale. We hope to bring this feature or a similar mechanism to the mobile app soon.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://reddit.com/link/x7fnzg/video/t85v9yfjj9m91/player\">Virtual scroll on 15_000 assets instant</a></p>\n<h1>Ah, I almost forgot, we have a dark mode on mobile now.</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/miw1xb24n9m91.png?width=4320&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b869514fec10283237eab0f8aaeaf68a40648c7c\">Dark Mode</a></p>\n<p>Besides the features above, we continuously fix bugs, improving and refactoring the code base to ensure the quality of the project.</p>\n<p>Finally, thanks to all who have contributed to the project.

The next release will port this feature to the mobile app to compliment the existing shared album feature.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/et9uavzqz5e91.png?width=3830&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a7b6d36478ba4d8b30d0b1185e545aded1a082f0\">Albums and Shared Albums</a></p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<h2>Other improvements</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We moved all the thumbnail generation processes to the server - this greatly improves the mobile app's backup process. It is not just fast\u2026 but <em>blazing</em> fast now! (Check out the embedded video below)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://reddit.com/link/w9o7g4/video/bq7ra69xz5e91/player\">Test upload on the local network - using 5Ghz WIFI band</a></p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We add i18n support to the mobile app. The mobile app is now translated to German, Danish, Italian, Spanish, French, Japanese, Polish and Finnish. If your phone is set to those languages and regions, the app will automatically be translated to those languages.</li>\n<li>The REST API on the server now follows the OpenAPI Spec, and we can generate SDK for other programming languages. This will be the stepping stone for additional integration and perhaps a plugin system for the future. The web uses Typescript SDK, and the mobile app uses Dart SDK. It is a pleasure to develop without manually writing HTTP requests for all the interactions with the server. \ud83d\ude42</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our Discord server (<a href=\"https://discord.gg/D8JsnBEuKb\">https://discord.gg/D8JsnBEuKb</a>) has been a very fun and welcoming place, and I love the community and the users engaged in testing and using the app. I believe your questions and feedback are the only way to improve the application. I encourage you to stop by to hang out or when you have questions or feedback for Immich.</p>\n<p>I want to borrow this opportunity to thank all the contributors (<a href=\"https://github.com/zackpollard\">Zach</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/matthinc\">Mathias</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/jbaez\">Jaime</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/bo0tzz\">boOtzz</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/zoodyy\">Fynn</a>, and many more) and the community for the ongoing support and feedback for Immich.

Then I started to test my documentation by starting from scratch. I repeated this countless times, switching even to new solutions after learning best practices. For example I switched from Ubuntu to Arch-based last year and completely updated the guide. What you have now is a complete, A to Z guide of things you need to do to setup your very own, energy efficient, homeserver.</p>\n<p>It is not just a How-To guide but for most people also a reference document, a 1-stop-shop containing all relevant information to build, install, configure and maintain  your own homeserver and the guide often offers you a few different options.</p>\n<p>Of course I also had to make choices, like OS and filesystem. While these were not simple choices and have been well thought-through, they may not be for everyone, but the guide does not need to be followed precisely from start till end. For example, for OS, Manjaro instead of plain Arch or Manjaro Minimal was chosen, to ensure you have to do as little as possible and giving you a lightweight, fast OS, benefiting from rolling updates instead of major upgrades and able to delete whatever you do not need.</p>\n<p>The guide now allows me to install a new server within 20 minutes, thanks to my post-install script (not required for the homeserver guide) and prep-server script (part of the guide). You will usually spend most time deciding what choice is best for you.</p>\n<p>It contains quite some detailed info, for example how to configure network, but also how to automatically delete watched episodes/movies unless you marked them as favourite. Or how to auto-update your download client port. And it is not just about mediaserving, that's just 1 aspect.</p>\n<p>Hope some people can benefit from having so much info organised in 1 single place. I had not come across something similar yet. Enjoy and feel free to create an issue on Github if you notice a typo or missing/confusing step.</p>\n<p>EDIT: I meant to post this in /r/homeserver. My mistake. I will leave it here as well for now.</p></div>",

To help not spamming people in the same time as protecting you and your domain reputation if one day you want to use it to send mails.</p>\n<p>The entry is registred in the form _dmarc.domain.tld. in TXT and a good content can be:\n<code>v=DMARC1;p=reject;pct=100;rua=mailto:oneadminaccount@example.com;ruf=mailto:oneadminaccount@example.com;sp=reject;aspf=s;</code>\nto explain the fields:\n  - <strong>p=reject</strong> indicate what to do with the mail that fail the SPF validation. In that case they will just be ignored and never reach the target address.\n  - <strong>pct=100</strong> indicate that 100% of the mail send from your domain will be tested\n  - <strong>rua/ruf</strong> in that case are for sending you a report mail when mail are tested and from where they came/what was done to them\n  - <strong>sp</strong> indicate how to manage mail sent from a subdomain of your domain (here, the same)\n  - and finally the <strong>aspf</strong> field compare the mailfrom: of the mail with the domain in the header. with <strong>strict</strong> if they are different, that's a fail.</p>\n<p>With just theses 2 fields added all the mail servers that check for mail policies will be aware that none of them are coming from you and just discard them while notifying you. That can help protect people from scam while maintaining the reputation fo your domain if one day you want to send mails with it.</p>\n<p><strong>Edit</strong>:</p>\n<p>Really nice addition from u/8poot, I think even better and concise than mine: <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/protect-domains-that-dont-send-email\">the version of gov.uk</a>.</p></div>",

I've found so much joy in developing and learning new skills for this project. Below are some big updates for the app since my last update.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We can now perform the <strong>selective backup</strong>, the user can choose which album on the phone to be <em>included</em> or <em>excluded</em> for assets to be backup, and only unique, non-overlapping assets in those selections will be back up to the server. So, no more backing up your unwanted assets from Whatapps \ud83d\ude01.</li>\n<li>The server now generates WEBP format for the thumbnail. This mechanism drastically improves the performance of the app, in terms of network usage and speed of quick load and server resources. For example, previously, it took around 5 GB of data transfer to scroll and load 7000 assets thumbnail, now it takes around 50MB. This means you don't need a fast network for fast loading and reducing the response time of the server. I guess I can now technically add \"blazing fast \ud83d\ude80\" to the readme file \ud83d\ude01.</li>\n<li>The <strong>WEB</strong> is finally here. A website made with SvelteKit is now dockerized and added to docker-compose for ease of deployment. You can now register an admin account through the website and add additional users by using the web interface, no more clunky command line to create the user. AND you can also view the backup assets on the web now, with those assets grouped by date, giving the familiar experiment with Google Photos. I am working on more features on the web to make it better and nicer, stay tuned!</li>\n</ol>\n<p>And of course, those features come along with plenty of bug fixes and QoS improvement as well.</p>\n<p>You can access the <a href=\"https://github.com/alextran1502/immich\">project repository here on Github</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/alextran1502/immich\">https://github.com/alextran1502/immich</a></p>\n<p>I am still researching how to best add facial recognition and clustering to the app. Below are some screenshots of the current stage of the app.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/hbdiwew5r3191.jpg?width=708&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dbfbf86a2df53babb0b0a67480bc2d14d70374c3\">Update Interfaces and Features</a></p>\n<p>Thank you to those who contributed to the project and supported me financially, if you want to buy me a cup of coffee, you can find the link here <a href=\"https://www.buymeacoffee.com/altran1502\">https://www.buymeacoffee.com/altran1502</a></p>\n<p>Until next time!</p>\n<p>Alex</p></div>",

There's a lot. This is an example of what I was able to do on more than one of them. </p>\n<p>So I found an unsecured Heimdall that had actually been setup fairly well for personal use, but the owner was using the fancy enhanced buttons. So I opened up the application list and went into edit. </p>\n<p>This guy was running AdGuard Home and AdGuard Home requires you provide your username and password to use the enhanced features. The username was plain text and Heimdall isn't the most secure so if you inspect element on the password field and change the type to text, you can see the data entered.</p>\n<p>So now I have his username and password. People tend to reuse these.</p>\n<p>He was also running Sonarr/Radarr so I gave those a go, they were actually password protected, I put in the username and password I just got and boom, I was in them too.</p>\n<p>I opened up his indexer list and could see he was using a bunch of usenet indexers. Now I couldn't get the username and passwords for these directly, but I did have the API keys. And I could find the sites quite easilly and already knew his username and password so could give those a shot. Turns out that worked for a couple of them.</p>\n<p>I could also see his download client was NZBGet. That also stores username and password. They matched what I already had, but if they were different I would have had them too.</p>\n<p>I hop over to his NZBGet and from here I can see his download servers. They also store username and password (note here, sabNZB does NOT allow you to view the stored password, but NZBGet does).</p>\n<p>So now I go to the site for one of his servers and what do you know, same username and password combo. From here I could see our guys email address. Bet he reused the password...</p>\n<p>He did.</p>\n<p>Oh, he was also running Portainer as an enhanced app on Heimdall. Portainer requires username/password for that feature. So now I'm in his Portainer.</p>\n<p>If you're worrying, I did nothing with all this information. Well that's not true, I did add the classic 1995 movie \"Hackers\" to his Radarr.</p>\n<p>And then sent him an anonymous email explaining what I had done and left a note directly on his Heimdall in case he missed the email.</p>\n<p>So in conclussion, make sure your shit is secure and don't reuse passwords.</p></div>",

I still have Gmail because it's a good junk mail pit but other than that, I have migrated all of my cloud services to my home server (and email hosting isn't worth it from what I hear). It feels pretty good to be out of the cloud and to have total ownership of my data. I'm so thankful to this community for making this possible!</p>\n<p>Here's my setup:</p>\n<h2>Services</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Document Storage: <a href=\"https://nextcloud.com\">Nextcloud</a></li>\n<li>Of course. I wish there was a less bloaty option but it's the best in the field.</li>\n<li>Document Editing: <a href=\"https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/DocumentServer\">OnlyOffice Document Server</a></li>\n<li>I tried hard to make LibreOffice work but OnlyOffice is just so clean</li>\n<li>Photo Management: <a href=\"https://photoprism.app/\">Photoprism</a></li>\n<li>Solid Google Photos replacement. Has facial recognition which is a must-have for me.</li>\n<li>Using Photosync for automatically uploading photos from my phone</li>\n<li>Smart Home: <a href=\"https://www.home-assistant.io/\">Home Assistant</a></li>\n<li>But of course. Awesome app. Wish I could get a job there.</li>\n<li>Network Video Recorder: <a href=\"https://frigate.video/\">Frigate</a></li>\n<li>Seriously one of the coolest parts of my home server. Totally local object detection and 24/7 recording. Better than any paid cloud service garbage.</li>\n<li>Media Streaming: <a href=\"https://jellyfin.org/\">Jellyfin</a></li>\n<li>I tried to get into Plex first but everything beyond the basics cost money and I'm really not going to be using it enough to be worth it.</li>\n<li>VPN: <a href=\"https://www.wireguard.com/\">Wireguard</a></li>\n<li>Classic.</li>\n<li>Chat: <a href=\"https://matrix.org/\">Matrix</a></li>\n<li>I only use this for getting messages from my home server.</li>\n<li>Push notifications don't work. Don't know why.</li>\n<li>Log Aggregation: <a href=\"https://www.graylog.org/\">Graylog</a></li>\n<li>It's really not a great app but we use it at work so whatevs.</li>\n<li>Backups: <a href=\"https://restic.net/\">Restic</a></li>\n<li>Great CLI tool for deduping and encrypting backups.</li>\n<li>Uses the snapshot model and can backup to S3.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Equipment</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Macbook Pro 2012, i7 2.6 GHz, 16 Gb RAM. Running Arch Linux (btw)</li>\n<li>Intel NUC 5th gen i5, 8 Gb RAM. Running Arch.</li>\n<li>Synology DiskStation NAS DS1019</li>\n<li>2x WD Red 4TB</li>\n<li>1x Seagate Skyhawk 2TB</li>\n<li>2x 500GB NVMe cache drives</li>\n<li>Linksys WRT3200ACM running <a href=\"https://openwrt.org/\">OpenWRT</a></li>\n<li>3x Reolink 4k IP Cameras</li>\n<li>1x Amcrest IP Camera</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Still on the Cloud</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://protonmail.com/\">ProtonMail</a></li>\n<li>Gmail</li>\n<li>Off-Site backups on <a href=\"https://www.storj.io/\">Storj.io</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://bitwarden.com/\">Bitwarden</a></li>\n<li>I was self-hosting this for a while but I figured, for 3 bucks a month or whatever, I can let them handle all my secrets.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Future Plans</h2>\n<p>I don't really know yet. I'm pretty happy with my setup. I'd like to get my server put together into a rackmount setup but it's working for now. I'm sure I'll find something else to self-host in another week or so.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/m1zypxw2cvo81.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8ddb637666b461a08df6d83aa08eeb64201cad75</p></div>",

Migrating from -ng is as easy as pointing your docker image to the new location ( <code>ghcr.io/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx:latest</code> ) and re-creating (<em>reminder: backup first</em>). </p>\n<p><strong>Paperless-ngx</strong> is focused on being community-driven, this release alone has contributions from over 50 (!) people with over 250 commits since the old repository and includes new features, bug fixes and security updates. If you're interested, please check it out (there's a demo now too) and if you're willing to contribute we'd love to have you, we are already working on more features for the next release!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx\">https://github.com/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx</a></p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><em>More info for the curious:</em></p>\n<p>As many of you know \"Paperless-ng\" was a very popular fork of the  document management system \"Paperless\". The initial author of -ng, Jonas Winkler, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/k28247/paperlessng_is_here_almost/\">created an amazing project</a> that was <a href=\"https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/commit/9b0063c9731f7c5f65b1852cb8caff97f5e40ba4\">eventually designated</a> as the 'official' successor. He maintained a furious development pace for some time but as of this post hasn't been heard from in months. A group of folks dedicated to the software (myself included) decided to try and revive the project and hopefully set it up for a long future. Yes, a similar thing happened with the original Paperless, we are hoping to avoid some of the same mistakes. See <a href=\"https://github.com/jonaswinkler/paperless-ng/issues/1632\">jonaswinkler/paperless-ng#</a><a href=\"https://github.com/jonaswinkler/paperless-ng/issues/1599\">1599</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/jonaswinkler/paperless-ng/issues/1632\">jonaswinkler/paperless-ng#1632</a> and historically <a href=\"https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/issues/711\">the-paperless-project/paperless#711</a> if you are curious for more about all of this.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><em>FYI</em>:</p>\n<p>I'm <code>@shamoon</code> on Github, have contributed heavily to -ng and now -ngx so yes I'm biased! I don't speak for the group as a whole.</p></div>",
