Below are the major ones, please read on.  </p>\n<p><strong>Updated documentation and tutorials</strong><br />\nI welcome you to our documentation part of the repo where you can find self-hosting, quick start guides, and a couple of explanatory videos. (Documentation is still a work in progress).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/wiretrustee/wiretrustee/blob/main/docs/README.md\">https://github.com/wiretrustee/wiretrustee/blob/main/docs/README.md</a></p>\n<p><strong>Multiplatform support</strong></p>\n<p>Wiretrustee works on Linux, macOS, and Windows. It also runs on arm devices like RaspberryPi.<br />\nOn Linux, Wiretrustee will use the kernel Wireguard module if available.</p>\n<p>Mobile apps are planned for the future. </p>\n<p><strong>Wiretrustee got a Management Service</strong></p>\n<p>A service that stores network metadata and distributes network changes to peers. </p>\n<p>So, the part when you had to manually configure peers (add-peer command) and remember IPs is now automatic. Whenever a new peer joins the network all other peers will receive an update and connect to it!  </p>\n<p>Additionally, Management Service supports SSL with an automatic Let's Encrypt certificate generation or a custom certificate from a file.</p>\n<p><strong>Wiretrustee got a Management UI Dashboard</strong></p>\n<p>A couple of screenshots first :)  </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/kjqnzr2ifzp71.png?width=667&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=598f0cb0a4dc6ac3c16ff74b9a2199c9fa35ad94\">Login screen</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/yjx818uvezp71.png?width=1316&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=270f899d96a6c9887522477c3f4a5764fbcedc43\">Peers list screen </a></p>\n<p>The dashboard displays a list of peers, setup keys, and helps to manage your network. It also features a social login and auto Let's Encrypt certificate. </p>\n<p>User management is the only part that can't be self-hosted. We decided to use the Auth0 service to \"outsource\" the user management part due to the fact that usually, it takes quite an effort to make it right and secure.</p>\n<p>The dashboard is an open-source single-page app written in React JS<br />\n<a href=\"https://github.com/wiretrustee/wiretrustee-dashboard\">https://github.com/wiretrustee/wiretrustee-dashboard</a></p>\n<p><strong>An upgraded relaying</strong></p>\n<p>Wiretrustee uses <a href=\"https://github.com/coturn/coturn\">TURN</a> to relay traffic in case a direct peer-to-peer connection isn't possible (happens with carrier-grade NATs). </p>\n<p>We've added a feature to secure access to the TURN relay with secret-based time-limited credentials. The Management Service periodically generates a token that can be used by peers to access TURN. Old tokens are expiring after TTL.  </p>\n<p><strong>P.S.</strong> <br />\nI hope you read it till the end :) Let me know what you think!</p></div>",

Any feedback is welcome!</code></p>\n<p><strong>Important</strong>: This guide is aimed at <em>beginners</em>, so I won't go too much in-depth and mostly rely on common sense and (fairly) easy to implement solutions. I will make a more advanced guide later on.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<h1>First: What's going on?</h1>\n<p>Recently posts have been showing up about people finding others' exposed dashboards or even fully unprotected services such as Heimdall, Pihole, Calibre, you name it. People expose it all on the public web, often without even knowing they're doing so.</p>\n<p>To some this might seem innocent, but it's not. Even if you're not a specific target to anyone, there a lots of automated bots and botnets out there who just scan the entire internet for exposed services like yours in order to exploit those.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><strong>So what are the dangers of this exactly?</strong></p>\n<p>Those services you're hosting are exposing a lot of your private info. I'll list a few examples of things I come across.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I once came across a fully open Calibre instance, upon browsing through it I found out that this particular person configured Calibres mail settings using their GMail details, just a little tinkering exposed their full GMail username and password</li>\n<li>People tend to use their full names, or even full address info, etc. in things like Nextcloud, maybe even things like Pihole or Heimdall. This <em>will</em> make you a target for (automated) phishing campaigns. If those services are publicly accessible you can easily assume that someone has already got his hands on your info.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So this all might seem innocuous to some, or some might even utter the: But I have nothing to hide - kind of phrase. But think about why most people are self-hosting in the first place. Privacy is most likely a big part of that, and now you're putting that out on the web for everyone to see?</p>\n<p>In example: Big data, botnets, hackers, etc.  can build an extensive profile based on this kind of info:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>One could sift through your Calibre service to find out what things you read.</li>\n<li>One could sift through your Pihole logs to find out what you do on the web.</li>\n<li>One could search through your Plex, Jellyfin, or others to find out what things you like to watch.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This kind of info is especially useful for things like Phishing campaigns. The more familiar and polished a phishing mail is, the more likely you'll fall for it. And you <em>will</em> be targeted. No-one's exempt.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Another danger is the case where people have a set-and-forget mentality, which leads them to never updating their services. In that case your service <strong>will</strong> get hacked at some point which might result in anything from your device being abused as cryptominer, to your connection being abused for malicious traffic, your devices being enslaved into a botnet or an actual human hacker who might have even more sinister intents.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<h1>How do I know if I'm publicly exposing services?</h1>\n<p>There are a few indicators which will easily tell you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Did you ever follow a guide that told you to port-forward something?</li>\n<li>Do you proxy or forward your services using a reverse proxy? (i.e. Nginx proxy manager)</li>\n<li>Can you access your services from anywhere (i.e. from your phone) without any extra effort like a VPN.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><strong>I'm not sure, how do I check?</strong></p>\n<p>There are plenty of tools that will freely tell you if you're hosting something. First you'll need to know your public IP. Some site like <a href=\"https://whatismyipaddress.com/\">https://whatismyipaddress.com/</a> will tell you.</p>\n<p>Please realise you might have a number of different IP addresses dependent on if your provider provides you with both IPv4 and/or IPv6. Your <em>public</em> IPv4 address will be the same for all devices in your network, but your IPv6 address will be different <em>per device!</em></p>\n<p>The following tools might give you an insight in the ports you have opened publicly:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Shodan</strong> <a href=\"https://shodan.io\">https://shodan.io</a> - Shodan does it's own scanning but will not per-say reveal everything as it does not tend to scan every single open port at any given time. Some IP addresses might not even be listed in Shodan.</li>\n<li><strong>Yougetsignal</strong> <a href=\"https://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/open-ports/\">https://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/open-ports/</a>  - Chances are that if you've been port forwarding you've been using a tool like this to actually verify if the port you've configured is accessible.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><strong>I'm still unsure and I want to scan it all, how do I do that?</strong></p>\n<p>This section is slightly more advanced, but if you can selfhost then you can do this too!</p>\n<p>First you'll need a device that does <em>not</em> host any of your services and a <strong>different internet connection</strong>. (Your phone's 4G or a neighbours WiFi will do).</p>\n<p>You'll need a port scanning tool, in this case I'll use nmap which is available for practically all linux distributions, macOS and Windows.</p>\n<p>If you're using Windows you can download nmap here: <a href=\"https://nmap.org/download.html\">https://nmap.org/download.html</a></p>\n<p>If you're using a Debian based distro (Debian, Ubuntu, Mint, etc.)  you can install nmap using <code>sudo apt install nmap</code></p>\n<p>If you're using a Redhat based distro (Redhat, Fedora, CentOS, etc.) you can install nmap using <code>sudo</code> <code>dnf install nmap</code></p>\n<p>If you're using macOS you can install nmap using Homebrew ( <a href=\"https://brew.sh\">https://brew.sh</a> ) by issuing <code>brew install nmap</code></p>\n<p>One you've got nmap setup, make sure you're using a different internet connection and then issue:</p>\n<pre><code>nmap -v -T4 -sV -A -p 1-65535 my.public.ip.address\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will take a while as it'll scan all available TCP ports. It'll also try to determine what's running on an open port it finds (-sV flag) as well as some additional detection (-A flag)</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<h1>Okay, so I do got open ports, what do I do?</h1>\n<p>Firstly, you'll have to close them. It's most likely that you'll do this in your router. If you're unsure then I'd suggest you check the guide that you used to setup your service in order to determine what steps you took to expose it to the internet in the first place.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><strong>So now my ports are closed, but I can't access service</strong> <strong><em>xyz</em></strong> <strong>from remote anymore. What do I do?</strong></p>\n<p>It's understandable you want to access your services from anywhere, but there are more secure methods for this then simply exposing this.</p>\n<p>There are a number of steps you can take which'll be listed in order from most secure to least.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use a VPN</li>\n<li>Setting up a VPN like <a href=\"https://www.wireguard.com/\">Wireguard</a> is easy and secure. WireGuard has support for all major devices and it'll allow you to access your entire network from anywhere.</li>\n<li><em>Sidenote: You'll have to port forward WireGuard from your router, this is to be expected. But exposing a VPN service to the public internet is way more secure then exposing an unsecured service.</em></li>\n<li>Use port-forwarding with specific IPs</li>\n<li>This is a feature some routers might not support. But you can utilize a whitelist of IPs that can access your service.</li>\n<li>Using Cloudflare's<a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/argo-tunnel/\">Argo tunnel</a></li>\n<li>By using Cloudflare's Argo tunnel you don't have to open any ports, but instead your webserver will build up a vpn-like connection to cloudflare, over which your webserver will be reachable to cloudflare. Your users then access your service through cloudflare without any risk for you due to exposed ports.</li>\n<li>Utilizing a security CDN like CloudFlare</li>\n<li>Using services like CloudFlare prevents an attacker from learning your actual IP address (unless said IP address can be accessed somehow through your service of course). Additionally CloudFlare actively filters out bots and malicious traffic. Depending on your tier with them you have more granular control and can choose to block entire countries from accessing your site.</li>\n<li>Use a reverse proxy with an authentication frontend</li>\n<li>One could utilize a platform like <a href=\"https://www.authelia.com/\">Authelia</a> or <a href=\"https://www.keycloak.org/\">Keycloak</a> to secure public-facing services.</li>\n<li>Use a reverse proxy and utilize access-lists</li>\n<li>A thing one could do with a reverse proxy like nginx is the usage of access lists. By using the <code>allow</code> <a href=\"https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_access_module.html\">directive</a> in the nginx config you can restrict entire services or subfolders to specific IP addresses.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><strong>I've read this all, but I still keep wanting to do the things I do. Any tips?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be aware of what info you expose using the services you expose to the internet.</li>\n<li>CHANGE DEFAULT PASSWORDS! This cannot be said enough, exposing services is one thing, but not changing passwords is like giving out your credit card to complete strangers and hoping they'll bring it back to you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<h1>General recommendations</h1>\n<p>These might be duplicates of parts above, but it's useful to sum them up:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Expose only what's really needed: Why would your service need to be open to the internet?</li>\n<li>Change default passwords: You don't give your credit card to strangers either, do you?</li>\n<li>Use common sense: You can't magically access something you host at home without exposing something to the public internet.</li>\n<li>Use 2FA wherever you can. Any form of 2FA is better then nothing. Most services support OTP (Google Authenticator/Authy/Yubico Auth) these days and the more advanced ones even support Webauthn (Yubikeys or any other hardware token)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>To-do parts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<blockquote>\n<p>!Extend on how-tos in building Wireguard, Nginx and NAT access lists!&lt;</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Changelog:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<blockquote>\n<p>!Added Clouflare's Argo Tunnel!&lt;</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<blockquote>\n<p>!Added 2FA and Cloudflare; Clarified requirement for separate connection for nmap.!&lt;</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<blockquote>\n<p>!Initial guide!&lt;</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ul></div>",

I don't want to host anything too important like emails or password managers, I don't want to be forced to spend an afternoon debugging if I don't feel like it. However I'd lime to add a couple more services, but I haven't found a good app yet :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A parcel tracker</li>\n<li>A financial dashboard linked to my bank accounts.

It is not really r/selfhosted material, but it somehow belongs here and I am curious to know if others had the same experience already.</p>\n<p>Ok short background, I am right now playing with a new server set-up. proxmox, opnsense, docker and last but not least caddy as reverse proxy. As you can see, many knobs and wheels, which can easily keep you busy for a few days.</p>\n<p>So right now I am looking into a problem that I can't resolve https requests to my docker containers with caddy in proxy-mode in-between. The point is I use a docker container for caddy, which creates the caddy config file on the fly, based on the keyword settings in the different docker-compose files. Thus, the idea is, you deal with config of caddy in docker-compose files, instead of having just another config file to take care of. </p>\n<p>As I face problems right now, I was looking into readmes, tutorials, blog-posts and as a well trained, battle-tested selfhost-nerd, I also checked the issue section of github-repros. One was interested as it proposed it would be nice to view the autogenerated caddy config file for debugging purpose. Many answers but nothing concrete and then I read the comment from that guy and he explained in a few sentences, how to look into the caddy log files via docker logs and that one can see the on-the-fly-caddy config file in the logs.</p>\n<p>I thought brillant, exactly what I need what a nice dude that he pointed that out. I looked at the users name (as usual) to make sure I might know him or at least to give him a silent tribute. What should I say, I do not even know that guy, I am the guy!!!</p>\n<p>Looks like I was here around a year ago. I answered that question and left. I never turned back, I even can't remember being on that topic before. Serious, it feels like someone else wrote it. Can't even remember why and how I came there.</p>\n<p>So wonder is this the next level? Should we all be nice and supportive to the community, as you never know whether your older self might appreciate it later? Did this happen to some of you?</p>\n<p>TLTR; I found a valuable answer in a comment to a related issue on a github repro, just to learn it was me, who commented that issue about a year ago and completely forgot about it.</p></div>",

Filebrowser will show the content of the homer-config-pvc (the Homer folder that contains its config saved in a volume)</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Now we just need to add a service so we can reach file browser:</p>\n<pre><code>apiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n  namespace: dashboard\n  name: browser-service\nspec:\n  ports:\n    - name: http\n      port: 80\n      protocol: TCP\n      targetPort: 80\n  selector:\n    app: homer\n</code></pre>\n<p>Once this is done we can port-forward that service to our local machine:</p>\n<pre><code>kubectl port-forward -n dashboard svc/browser-service 8082:80\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here I chose 8082 so filebrowser will be available at <a href=\"http://localhost:8082\">http://localhost:8082</a> (user: admin, pass: admin)</p>\n<p>Once logged in you will see the following (in white cause I changed here to dark mode)</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ennsl6k7xvl71.png?width=1205&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f39e4b45f754b4b7d741f1f2c7e22dcd564ce08\">File browser showing homer config directory</a></p>\n<p>From this point onward you can do pretty much what you want here, add files, remove, edit etc which makes Homer much more easy to configure (I mean you could also have an NFS volume directly attached to the pod and edit from there but I like to have those separated and only do backup to the NAS to each their own)</p>\n<p>Hope this can help someone out there !</p></div>",

My current one is a Dell Precision T5610 (2x Xeon E5-2620 v2) which is great in every way except for SATA3 ports. In order to accommodate my data drives I picked up a cheapish PCI-E 4-port SATA controller, created a couple zfs pools (2 separate mirrors) and it had been running great for months.</p>\n<p>Then one morning I launch Miniflutt (my Miniflux app of choice) and my connection times out. I ssh into the server and it's still up, but upon further inspection, none of my data drives connected to the PCI-E controller are showing. I check that it's in the PCI-E slot firmly and try a couple other things but the SATA controller appears to be dead.</p>\n<p>Fast forward a couple days and a new, hopefully better quality, SATA controller arrives. I plug in the drives and boot up, and one of my pools has already been restored. The other has an SSD for bonus caching and its mount point wasn't empty (I assumed some cached files remained since the SSD is plugged into the motherboard). So I move the files in the mount point, re-import the pool, and bam we're back in business with no data loss.</p>\n<p>So I just wanted to give a shoutout to zfs for how easy it makes dealing with RAID drives. It has simple commands that are easy to remember, takes care of changing device paths automatically, and makes migrating to new machines trivial. I also don't have any friends that are nerdy enough in real life to talk about these things with, so I appreciate all you internet strangers who get me.</p></div>",

Recently I have been losing data because of crashes that just completely ruin Docker's setup. Each time this happens I scramble to figure out how to get my data back, taking far too many hours. I do have a backup solution but there is always some sort of server/Docker setup that needs to be discovered and worked through.</p>\n<p>Now, I'm  a uni student. My weeks and weekends are sporadic and always full. If my server goes down I can't just wait to get off at 5 and fix it that afternoon. It'll be down for a week or more as I find ways to get around my own services just to use basic things like my calendar (which I rely on very much).</p>\n<p>I'm still interested in self hosting and I'm glad I learned the things I learned, but it is becoming too much.</p></div>",

While this is cool/fine for our purposes, I've been wanting to scratch this itch of taking us off of discord and onto something self-hosted. I'd like to have a chat app that is just for the local network, or at least p2p and can communicate over lan. It should also preferably have markdown &amp; image/link embeds. As a bonus, it would be nice to have a way to sync up to the chat while away from home, but I figure I could always set up a VPN to let them tunnel into the home network if that's not natively supported.</p>\n<p>I've looked at a few options, like self-hosting a matrix/IRC server, but I'm not sure what is best. Any suggestions?  </p>\n<p>EDIT: There are a lot of suggestions, but I'd like to know the pros/cons of each. I should also mention that this is primarily for text chat; since we're in close proximity (roommates) we can just knock on each others' doors if we need something haha. Or if people are out and about we can just call over the phone like normal people do.</p></div>",

With the advice of other lovely folk scattered about these forums, I've now settled on a, better, workflow and feel the need to share.</p>\n<p>Hopefully it'll help someone else in the same boat.</p>\n<p>I've been using <a href=\"https://swiftscan.app/\">SwiftScan</a> for years (back when it had a different name) as it allowed me to \"scan\" my documents and mail from my phone, OCR them, then upload straight into Nexcloud.  Done.   But I lost the ability to use the OCR functionality as I was unable to activate my purchases Pro features without a Google Play account.</p>\n<p>I've since found a better workflow;  In <em>reverse</em> order...</p>\n<h1>Management</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/jonaswinkler/paperless-ng\">Paperless-ng</a> is fan-bloody-tastic!  I'm using the LinuxServer.io docker image and it's working a treat.  All my new scans are dumped in here for better-than-I'm-used-to OCR goodness.  I can tag my documents instead of battling with folders in Nextcloud.</p>\n<p><em>Top tip:  put any custom config variables (such as custom file naming) in the docker-compose file under \"environment\".</em></p>\n<h1>PDF cleaning</h1>\n<p>But, I've since found out that my <em>existing</em> OCR'd PDFs have a janked-up OCR layer that Paperless-ng does NOT like - the text content is saved in a single column of characters.  Not Paperless-ng's fault, just something to do with the way SwiftScan has saved the files.</p>\n<p>So, after a LOT of hunting, I've eventually settled on <a href=\"https://www.pdfshaper.com/\">PDF Shaper Free for Windows</a>.  The free version still allows exporting <em>all</em> images from a PDF.  Then I convert all those images back into a fresh, clean PDF (no dirty OCR).  This gets dumped in Paperless-ng and job's a good'un.</p>\n<p><em>Top tip:  experiment with the DPI setting for image exports to get the size/quality you want, as the DPI can be ignored in the import process.</em></p>\n<h1>Scanning</h1>\n<p>I can still scan using SwiftScan, but I've gone back to a dedicated document scanner as without the Pro functionality, the results are a little... primitive.</p>\n<p>I've had an old all-in-one HP USB printer/scanner hooked up to a Raspberry Pi for a few years running CUPS.  Network printing has been great via this method.  But the scanner portion has sat unused ever since.  Until, now....  WHY DID NOBODY TELL ME ABOUT <a href=\"https://github.com/sbs20/scanservjs\">SCANSERV-JS</a>?!  My word this is incredible! It does for scanning what CUPS does for printing, and with a beautiful Web UI.</p>\n<p>I slapped the single-line installer into the Pi, closed my eyes, crossed my fingers, then came back after a cup of tea.  I'm now getting decent scans (the phone scans were working OK, but I'd forgotten how much better a dedicated scanner is) with all the options I'd expect and can download the file to drop in Paperless-ng.  It even does OCR (which I've not tested) if you want to forget Paperless-ng entirely.</p>\n<p><strong>Cheers</strong></p>\n<p>I am a very, very happy camper again, with a self-hosted, easy workflow for my scanned documents and mail.</p>\n<p>Thanks to all that have helped me this month.  I hope someone else gets use from the above notes.</p>\n<p><em>ninja-edit:  Corrected Scan</em><strong><em>Server</em></strong> <em>to Scan</em><strong><em>Serv</em></strong>, but the error in the title will now haunt me until the end of days.</p></div>",

Along the way I discovered this sub and got totally hooked on self hosting services at my house, rediscovered my passion for Linux and system building, and even started implementing some of those concepts in my work. After I graduated, I was applying (rather painfully, shout out to /r/RecruitingHell) to many engineering positions in my discipline but also one long-shot which was decidedly a departure from what I studied - it involved designing new computer systems to help do the sort of research I had studied.</p>\n<p>In the technical interviews, it became clear that my experience with programming, containerized systems, and server management were key to them eventually offering me the job. Essentially some tools I designed for my research and posted to GitHub became my ticket to a new type of career.</p>\n<p>Thanks in part to you all, I now get to call myself a software systems engineer! I\u2019m working in a research field I was already interested in, but get paid to play around with designing locally hosted systems. Having a degree and background in the field were important, but 90% of my day-to-day tasks are based on skills I practiced on my own time. Remember that the things you learn here are valuable, and can even help you find a career if that interests you. </p>\n<p>Now one day I may even be able to earn enough money to pay for all this crap you inspired me to buy\u2026</p></div>",

I am building a Zeek-on-steroids Web interface, called <strong>paqetz</strong> (hoping to sound like 'packets').</p>\n<p>I want to keep it as much lightweight as I can. My toolkit is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Debian 10</li>\n<li>Ruby 3.0 &amp; Sinatra</li>\n<li>Zeek</li>\n<li>Fluentbit</li>\n<li>InfluxDB</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The goal is to let the user quickly-and-easily setup a security monitoring system. I am hoping to be able to run this in Raspberry Pi 4's. Here are some very-early-stage screenshots:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/a5hhigdwo3h71.png?width=2640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e41b0af7287b2f48957c45d474d654780bdc9137\">dashboard</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/k10clx9cq3h71.png?width=2884&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3046d2400478c835b4ef15364c1befe6fcc1c46\">settings</a></p>\n<p>The app takes care of deploying changes to zeek. Logs are being parsed and aggregated with fluentbit where they being persisted to an InfluxDB database and queried by Ruby back.</p>\n<p>The roadmap for v1 is 99,9% setup validation and stability. I am planning to add some integrations (telegram, slack etc.) but also apply some basic machine learning theory to predict malicious activities. I am also planning to integrate an offensive scanner I've been working on for a long time, based on nmap and other tools, so the user will be able to gather more information for attackers and intruders.</p>\n<p>I will be releasing this as open source publicly in github as soon as I am sure most of the things work fine. I was hoping to monetize this project but... that's another story.</p>\n<p>I am looking forward to any feedback, questions or feature requests.  </p>\n<p>EDIT: Just created a community /r/paqetz</p></div>",

If you're unfamiliar, Netmaker is a VPN platform built for kernel WireGuard (because of this it can run \\~50%+ faster than many similar platforms). It manages an arbitrary number of virtual networks with advanced features like private DNS, ingress, and egress gateways.</p>\n<p><strong>Here's the major updates in v0.7:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Multitenancy:</strong> Multiple users can share a single server to run and manage separate WireGuard networks.</li>\n<li><strong>UDP Hole-Punching:</strong> Server maintains a list of UDP ports opened by peers and makes them accessible to WireGuard peers in the network, simplifying NAT-to-NAT</li>\n<li><strong>Kubernetes Manifests</strong>: Meshed WireGuard networks for cluster nodes</li>\n<li><strong>Database:</strong> Shifted from MongoDB to rqlite. Additional database support is now just a single file change, and can support practically any SQL distro or general key-value store.</li>\n<li><strong>Quick Start guide:</strong> <a href=\"https://netmaker.readthedocs.io/en/v0.7.1/quick-start.html\">rebooted for a simplified setup</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you're looking for an extended overview of what Netmaker is all about, you should <a href=\"https://itnext.io/getting-started-with-netmaker-a-wireguard-virtual-networking-platform-3d563fbd87f0\">check out this walkthrough</a>.</p>\n<p>At this point, on the server side, we're about where we want to be with the major changes, and the updates will be more for added stability and security. The one last major feature we'll be adding server-side is <strong>relay server support,</strong> which will be relatively straightforward and handle remaining edge cases where network connectivity can't be achieved directly.</p>\n<p>Moving forward, our work will be more on the client side. At this point, we're just running on Linux. With the release of WireGuard NT last week, we plan on adding Windows support as soon as possible, because that is amazing, and from there branching out into userspace implementations to support MacOS and other operating systems.</p>\n<p>Thanks everyone, we've appreciated all your support in bringing this project to where it is over the past several months.</p></div>",

Thought I would share this github repository that I've been using for a few months now. It's called \"Clipface\" and it was created by a fellow named Hubro. It runs in a docker container and is an amazing replacement to Streamable.</p>\n<p>Streamable has a free tier, but they lower the quality on embed streams and delete the videos after a certain amount of time.</p>\n<p>Clipface can embed your video into things like Discord just like Streamable which make it a great replacement for people trying to share gaming clips with their friends. You can also lock your Clipface from public access and generate a \"public URL\" for each video which generates a token by hashing the file's name and your password (this way you can change your password and instantly make all public URL's usless if you need to).</p>\n<p>I host my Clipface on a VPS I use for hosting websites/web servers since my internet speeds at home are not capable of streaming video up and it works great. Hubro was going to add a number of features including file uploading in browser, but he hasn't updated the repository in 2 months so I was hoping if I could bring some attention to Clipface he may be encouraged to continue development. I currently upload files using Filezilla, but you could probably use Syncthing and just drag the videos to a folder on your LAN and then have them sync to your clips folder on your VPS.</p>\n<p>Here is the GitHub repository: <a href=\"https://github.com/Hubro/clipface\">https://github.com/Hubro/clipface</a></p></div>",
