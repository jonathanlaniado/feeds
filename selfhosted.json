Each upgrade is a hassle, libreoffice/onlyoffice work sometimes and then randomly it stops. Even worse is right now I gave up on all nextcloud features, except for cospend. Still suddenly it stops working. I tried the linuxserver and the official image and both have always issues. I know selfhosting is work, but Nextcloud is the most unreliable piece of software I ever hosted and I am done fixing it.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Hence I am wondering, is this only for me the case? I keep seeing many people loving their nextcloud instance, but maybe people in my situation never had the chance to talk about it? As an administrator I think it's quite embarrassing that I had to reinstall an application over 8 times...</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Sorry if this is too hateful, WAF is getting quite low if the cospend projects keep getting lost. Switching now to just selfhost the native Ihatemoney project.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>A few years back, I came upon the concept of DeGoogling and it fascinated me. The idea of not relying on Google (or anyone really) for all of your services and learning tons along the way was a really big appeal for me fresh out of college and at my first job where i finally had access to real income. I bought a pi, A NAS and got to work, which lead me here, r/selfhosted.</p>\n<p>But if you frequent this subreddit, you'll hear the sentiment here and other places: Don't selfhost email, it's not worth it.</p>\n<p>And they have good points. It's not worth the work, it'll never be reliable as gmail, and it's a lot of maintaining for something you probably should never use professionally.</p>\n<p>I imagine like a lot of you here, you take it personally as a challenge. I know I did.</p>\n<p>As my projects grew, the NAS turned into a fullgrown server, the 1 Pi turned to 4 (Well I use 4 at the moment. Honestly, I've lost count how many I own) and I'm fully selfhosted</p>\n<p>... except email. </p>\n<p>I'd work on it for a week, get mad when it didn't work the way I wanted and just scrapped it and worked on something else. </p>\n<p>and today, after years of dabbling with it on and off, i did what i thought was impossible: Self-Hosted Email (with a few nitpick specifics)</p>\n<p>Those nitpicks are as follows:</p>\n<p>No monthly subscription*- So no VPSs, hosted email, etc (The only subscription i pay for is email filtering via MXguarddog at 3$USD a year, i'll give it a pass)</p>\n<p>Low Maintainence- Before you say it, I know. \"Low maintenance Self-hosted email\" is a oxymoronic statement but I spent a lot of time setting up postfix and dovecot manually that I was never really happy with the results until I found some Docker solutions that lets me be more hands off. I understand them just enough to not wnt to deal with them (Anyone whos trying to do the same, i HIGHLY suggest doing it manually at least once to understand how they work and then use something like Mailcow, Mailu, Citadel, etc)</p>\n<p>Low Power- A lot of the solutions I've found are x86 only. I'd use a Pi/ARM solution but the one that i did find (Citadel) i honestly didn't love. Also I like docker too much. I install only containers when I can help it. I have a bunch of old laptops/desktops i could use that'd be up for the job but that'd be overkill for something so simple.</p>\n<p>Isolated- I want it to be a dedicated device. Even if i dockerize it, due to the nature of email, If something goes VERY wrong, i don't want it to touch my system critical services. This must not mingle with my main server in any way.</p>\n<p>So, what did we end up with?</p>\n<p>A 2GB Rock Pi X Model B which runs x86_64 pure debian server. it has its own ssd via USB, no sd card failure here. Docker/Docker-compose running Mailu 1.8. MXGuarddog filters incoming messages and Mailgun relays them outgoing so they're accepted (I use a home Dynamic IP internet. I'll get blacklisted to hell and back without a relay. I had to request my ISP to open port 25 but you can probably get this working on another port if they won't open it.). ddclient handles my DDNS on a separate server. I have an Nginx reverse proxy for the webmail portion (admin is lan only) which again is on another server.</p>\n<p>This will not explain docker, getting a domain, setting up the rock pi/host OS or anything else. This is strictly what i followed for my email setup. This is also not as thorough as i'd like from security standpoint so it's not my final iteration of this yet.</p>\n<p>Also my nitpicks may be different from yours. Maybe you want to use a VPS/VM or full machine but this should work for any x86 docker setup that's up to date.</p>\n<p>Here's all my sources for the biggest places I got stuck as far as email goes:</p>\n<h1>(In bold will be what should be working by the end of this step)</h1>\n<p>https://samhobbs.co.uk/raspberry-pi-email-server (this taught me initially how to setup an email server. It worked but i ended up tearing it all down and starting over. Also it took me forever but i feel this is needed first before you even consider keeping it in the long term. At least if i need to troubleshoot my setup, I know how to approach it, somewhat.) Don't try to do this all in one sitting, you'll hate yourself. Do it bits at a time, really understand what's being done and why and complete it at your own pace and then.. </p>\n<h1>You'll have an email server! Sorta. You can fix it up from here but I rather not maintain it so I wiped my OS, started fresh, installed docker and moved on.</h1>\n<p>https://mailu.io/master/compose/setup.html (this takes you through the mailu setup. I used the setup configurator (https://setup.mailu.io/1_7/) for 1_7 and changed it to 1.8 in the docker compose file).  </p>\n<h1>At this point you should have a working mailu installation accessible via lan. You should also be able to connect to it via an email client such as thunderbird, even if you can't send/receive email yet. Since im using a reverse proxy, i chose mail option for TLS in the config so i have SSL for email but not for web access. Your needs may vary here but that's where i got into trouble in my setup. if you don't know what you need, use the letsencrypt option. we're going to use mxguarddog for filtering so antispam and antivirus are optional as clamav will eat up more resources than than anything else but I'm paranoid.</h1>\n<p>https://reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/cw8w7p/dealing_with_selfhosted_email_a_nononsense_guide/ (This helped me with the setup for email filtering and relays. I didnt end up going with sendgrid and went with Mailgun instead. same basic idea though) </p>\n<h1>By the end of this, you should be able to receive email both via thunderbird/webmail, but not send yet.</h1>\n<p>https://documentation.mailgun.com/en/latest/quickstart-sending.html#add-receiving-mx-records (mailgun setup for verifying your domain. ignore the SMTP portion for that. we're using a smart relay) </p>\n<h1>At this point you should be able to send emails but not via Mailu. I used thunderbird to connect to my server and changed the SMTP settings to send email via Mailgun and not Mailu. We'll set that up next.</h1>\n<p>https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/387 (At this point, i could receive but not send email. the last great issue i ran into was the smart relay. the scripts from Orkhan Alikhanov and peterwilli particularly helped here. i was running into an auth problem with 1.7 but switching to 1.8 resolved it) </p>\n<h1>And this is where i called it quits. Emails should be working in both directions at this point from both Mailu and third party clients. The only thing i didnt confirm is if SMTP and IMAP work from Thunderbird outside of the LAN but I think we did the hard part already.</h1>\n<p>below is my nginx reverse proxy config for mailu. If you want Admin to be web accessible, uncomment out the block</p>\n<pre><code>server {\n  listen 443 ssl;\n  listen [::]:443 ssl;\n\n  server_name your.sub.domain;\n\n  ssl_certificate /your/cert.pem;\n  ssl_certificate_key /your/key.pem;\n\n  client_max_body_size 0;\n\n  location /webmail {\n  proxy_pass https://yourserver/webmail;\n  }\n\n# location /admin {\n#    proxy_pass http://yourserver/admin;\n#    proxy_set_header Host $http_host;\n#  proxy_redirect https://yourserver https://your.sub.domain; \n# }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I'm SURE my setup isn't perfect but It's good enough for me to look back on and say \"Yeah, I did that\" even if it did take a lot of internet strangers along the way to help. This is sort of my way of giving back to r/selfhosted. I'm by means no expert but i'll try to help out where I can. Also any suggestions for improvement or something I missed would be great.</p>\n<p>Good luck to anyone who wants to give this a shot. I hope you can feel as proud as I did when I got it working myself. I'm rooting for you too. :)</p>\n<p>EDIT:</p>\n<p>Things I'm planning on adding when I can as I think of them:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Fix IMAP/SMTP SSL off Lan</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Rejecting all emails that's not from MXGuarddog (Firewall router blocks all requests to my open ports that are not on from their IPs)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",
