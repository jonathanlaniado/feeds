I don\u2019t see a way to unsubscribe anywhere, so I don\u2019t even know if I was subscribed. And the last update was over a year ago. </p>\n<p>As for bugs, I\u2019m talking invoice totals of $1000 arriving to clients as \u201c$1000.1000\u201d, line items that cannot be removed once added, random letters being appended to client names, and symbols being rendered as the code version of HTML entities. </p>\n<p>Support is non existent. It\u2019s been over a week since I asked for a refund and their SLA is 1 day. Return window is only 14 days</p>\n<p>They didn\u2019t address my bug questions either.</p>\n<p>Now I\u2019m having to dispute through my card issuer.</p>\n<p>You\u2019re better off buying a well reviewed invoicing software from Code Canyon or maybe a different suggestion you can find here</p>",
