But as you can imagine, I'd like to have access to some services, like Jellyfin or Zabbix from outside, not only from my own network.</p>\n<p>This guide is the result of me searching for the best and most secure solution to that problem. It's not THE BEST, it's not THE MOST SECURE, as always you should use your own head and judgement. But I think for non-critical applications, such as self-hosted Zabbix should be more than fine.</p>\n<p>What will be used here is Cloudflare Zero Trust, which is available for free on Cloudflare account. Note - I know for sure this works if you have domain registered via CF, not sure and no way to check if it's possible with different registrators. </p>\n<p><strong>So first things first - what it is and how it works?</strong> <br />\nI'll explain only bits important for this guide. So we will use Zero Trust Tunnel and Zero Trust Application Access.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Zero Trust Tunnel is essentially a site-to-site VPN between your network and Cloudflare Zero Trust servers. It enables CF to access your resources via local IP address, resolve them and assign them its own public IP. It takes your local IP addresses, creates a CNAME for your domain, then routes all traffic via CF public IPv4 and IPv6 addresses via their proxy to your designated local IPv4 addresses. If you nslookup your hostname, you'll only get CF from their <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/ips/\">IP Ranges</a></li>\n<li>Zero Trust Application Access is a way to secure access to your applications, essentially enforcing going through loops and hoops on CF-hosted authentication page, before you can access even the login screen of your service</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Let's setup a Tunnel</strong><br />\nThe way ZT Tunnel is set up is, you go from your Dashboard to Zero Trust -&gt; Networks -&gt; Tunnels. Here you can find a detailed instruction on how to install and connect <em>cloudflared</em> daemon, that acts as a connector and gateway to your home network. If you use virtualization, like Proxmox, I recommend setting up a small VM/CT, to act as your connector.<br />\nOnce this is set up you Configure it and add <strong>Public Hostname</strong>. Here you can add local IP addresses of your services. And here are some caveats:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You want to select HTTP, not HTTPS. Cloudflare Zero Trust adds its own SSL/TLS reverse proxy, so in the end your services are behind HTTPS. If you have ONLY HTTPS (like with Proxmox) you want to select HTTPS, and in TLS settings enable \"No TLS Verify\" and \"HTTP2 connection\".</li>\n<li>You HAVE to change default port from 80 to something else. For some reason, if your service is hosted on port 80, CF doesn't add it own SSL/TLS (eg. PiHole, where you can easly change it to something like 8100).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now you can access your services from outside with hostnames you set up, but it's still not very secure - if you can access them, everyone can access them. And yes, if you're using a strong, complicated, random password the risk is minimized, but there are still exploits one can use. So let's fortify them further.</p>\n<p><strong>Cloudflare Zero Trust Access - suprisingly strong tool</strong></p>\n<p>Now what Access is I already explained. But what I didn't specify, how powerful it actually is. When you set it up and type in your service URL, you get redirected to <a href=\"https://cloudflareaccess.com\">cloudflareaccess.com</a> domain, requiring you to authenticate. By default you have only access to OTP authentication via e-mail - you type in your email, are sent an access OTP, and only when you type it in, you get access for several minutes/hours/days. However, with ZT Access you have at least for or five levels of authentication:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You can set up multiple authentication methods: OTP, login via numerous sites (Facebook, GitHub, LinkedIn), OAuth2 (Google, Azure, Google Workspaces), OneLogin, OpenID, with timeout spanning from 1 minute to 1 month</li>\n<li>You can restrict who can use these authentication methods, based on their e-mail addess, geolocation, IP range, service token</li>\n<li>You can require user to state a justification on why they want to access the service, with manual review and accept</li>\n<li>You can require using WARP (Cloudflare's own \"sort of VPN\", available at <a href=\"https://1.1.1.1\">1.1.1.1</a>) to even access these authentication methods, and can also be connected with policies and restrictions from point 2</li>\n<li>You can set up multiple WARP client restrictions, like does the user have encrypted hard drive, does it have a particular file, with particular name in specified location on their PC, does the user use WARP as is, or is logged in to your Zero Trust organization</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So you can essentially set up something like \"to access my zabbix, you have to have WARP enabled and logged in into organization, have encrypted hard drive, be located in Germany, your e-mail has to be on <a href=\"https://foo.bar\">foo.bar</a>, and you have to have this picture of a monkey named gibaccess.png on your desktop, then and only then, you can ask me, with proper justification to use your GitHub account to authenticate your access, but only for 1 hour\". Suffice to say... it's powerful.</p>\n<p>Buuuuut for our purpose I think OTP with restriction to only allow a single email address recieve the code will be more than enough. I will not describe the full process, if you self-host you're smart enough to understand what's going on. The most important - you want to create a new Application, select <strong>self-hosted</strong>, add domains from your Tunnel Public Hostnames, and set up policies - bare minimum is <strong><em>Include - Everyone, Require - Emails - your email only</em></strong><em>.</em> <br />\nOnce you set up Application, you have to go back to Tunnels, and reconfigure each Hostname, enabling Access and selecting Application you just created. </p>\n<p>And now when you type in your service URL you'll be thrown into Cloudflare Access page, requiring to type in your email. You can type any email, but if you configured policy correctly, the code will only be sent if you provide your email. It'll take any other email, but won't send code.</p>\n<p><strong>That's all, hope you like it, and have fun using it :)</strong> </p>",

We are open source and our primary objective is to simplify complexity and accelerate the development process.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishing this Goal</h2>\n<p>There are multiple avenues, and I'll highlight just a few:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Instant Local Simulation:</strong></li>\n<li>Visualize, debug, and test apps locally without the need for creating cloud mockups.</li>\n<li><strong>Cloud Services Integration:</strong></li>\n<li>Treats cloud services and distributed computing as integral language primitives.</li>\n<li><strong>Cross-Compilation:</strong></li>\n<li>Compiles to JavaScript and IaC (Terraform and Cloudformation), with support for additional provisioning engines in the pipeline.</li>\n<li><strong>Multi-Cloud Support:</strong></li>\n<li>Code compatibility across different clouds such as AWS, GCP, and Azure.</li>\n<li><strong>Least-Privilege IAM Policies:</strong></li>\n<li>The compiler generates IAM policies and other cloud mechanics based on intent.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.winglang.io/blog/2023/02/17/plugins\"><strong>Compiler Plugins</strong></a><strong>:</strong></li>\n<li>Customize generated infrastructure definitions with ease.</li>\n<li><strong>JavaScript Interoperability:</strong></li>\n<li>Integration with JavaScript.</li>\n<li><strong>Terraform Resource Support:</strong></li>\n<li>Support for any Terraform resource.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Exploring the Language</h2>\n<p>Curious about playing with Winglang? Visit our <a href=\"https://www.winglang.io/play/\">playground</a> to experiment with the code and experience the local simulator in action.</p>\n<h2>Self-Hosting Your Winglang App</h2>\n<p><strong>Local Simulation:</strong> Instantly simulate and test your Winglang application locally without the need for creating cloud mocks. Visualize and debug your app in a controlled environment.</p>\n<p><strong>Deploy on Your Infrastructure:</strong> Once satisfied with your app's functionality, deploy it on your infrastructure. This could be your personal server, a cloud instance, or any environment where you have control.</p>\n<h2>Getting Involved</h2>\n<p>Your feedback is invaluable to us, covering every facet of the project. We're actively seeking developers to become part of our community, contributing their expertise to shape the future of Winglang.</p>\n<p>If Winglang intrigues you, a \u2b50\ufe0f on GitHub would mean the world to us. It helps bring the project to the attention of more developers \ud83d\ude4f, and your support is genuinely appreciated!</p>\n<h2>More Information</h2>\n<p>Explore further details, including how to kickstart your journey with Wing and the rationale behind building it as a language, on our GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/winglang/wing\">Winglang Repository</a>.</p>",

UnRaid's community apps made this whole process much less painful than it otherwise would've been. I was surprised at just how many cloud services I was relying on, so here is how I went about replacing as many of them as I could with FOSS.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Amazon Kindle</strong> - <a href=\"https://github.com/Kareadita/Kavita\">Kavita</a>. <a href=\"https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web\">Calibre-Web</a> was a strong contender here, and still is, but Kavita was fairly painless to setup and use, once I got used to the file structure it requires. It's broad support for different kinds of ebooks, manga, and comics, including PDF style books, won me over quick.</li>\n<li><strong>Google Podcasts</strong> - <a href=\"https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf\">AudioBookShelf</a>. Downloaded images and metadata for my podcasts as well as the automatic downloads I was used to, and has a nice Android app which I've put to good use. Everything worked so well out of the box I didn't bother to research alternatives.</li>\n<li>Audible - Also AudioBookshelf.</li>\n<li><strong>ChatGPT</strong> - <a href=\"https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama\">Ollama</a>. Wonderfully slick UI and easy install, the Ollama UNRAID package ended up seemingly being both lighter and faster than the OobaBooga install I was used to, and it nicely emulates the ChatGPT style interface, allowing you to send images to it for models that support it. OllamaHub even appears to be working to replace custom GPTs.</li>\n<li><strong>Google Drive</strong> - <a href=\"https://github.com/nextcloud/\">NextCloud</a>. Seemed a bit finicky at first, but not entirely their fault. The reverse proxy I had caused errors on larger files, and manually configuring a larger max temp file size finally allowed me to drop in large files as I was used to. Office app integration was a landmine field of suffering, including known performance issues just for having them installed. Ultimately I decided it wasn't worth it, and instead opted for a local LibreOffice install which was synced to the server with NextCloud Files.</li>\n<li><strong>Google Tasks</strong> - Next Cloud Tasks. Not a big task user. Simple was fine.</li>\n<li><strong>Google Photos</strong> - NextCloud again. Worked as a drop in replacement for my purposes. I used the Android app to configure sync on my phone's photos folder and set it to automatically upload over WiFi. The Android Photos app is paid, so instead I still use the google photos app, but with their cloud sync disabled, so nothing is uploaded. Simplistic but does the trick. I strongly considered <a href=\"https://github.com/immich-app/immich\">Immich</a>, but it is reportedly still undergoing rapid development and I wanted something more stable.</li>\n<li><strong>Google Home</strong> - <a href=\"https://github.com/home-assistant\">HomeAssistant</a>. I'm setting up my IoT devices on their own separate VLAN, with all Zigbee devices. I've installed HomeAssistant on a VM instead of a docker because it's easier to manage that way.</li>\n<li><strong>Google Keep</strong> - <a href=\"https://github.com/nextcloud/notes\">NextCloud Notes</a>. Very lightweight, simple note taking app. It supports a nice grid layout too for the full Keep experience as well, and works great for quick reminders, like my grocery list. Most note taking apps seem to use markdown under the hood, so a lot of them are functionally very similar.</li>\n<li><strong>OneNote</strong> - <a href=\"https://github.com/laurent22/joplin\">Joplin</a>. For anything more elaborate, note taking with Joplin worked very well with it's built in rich text editor, and I found it very tweakable with many plugins and extension options for formatting. I highly recommend getting <a href=\"https://github.com/JackGruber/joplin-plugin-backup/\">Simple Backup</a>. What won me over was the ease with which I could copy and paste images into it and have them display on the Android app. I considered Obsidian however I didn't want to pay for sync with a nice free option available instead. Organization similar to OneNote was also very possible with multiple nested notebooks.</li>\n<li><strong>iDrive</strong> - <a href=\"https://github.com/gilbertchen/duplicacy\">Duplicacy</a>. I strongly considered <a href=\"https://github.com/kopia/kopia\">Kopia</a> and Duplicati at first, but Kopia's immaturity as a project and the frequent horror stories I read about Dupliacti led me to Dupliacy. The GUI isn't FOSS but the command line was, and I really appreciated this solution's ability to deduplicate files and cope with my frequent file reorganization without creating needless duplicates inflating my backup size. New revisions take up minimal storage space, and an encrypted repo hosted on Black Blaze B2 provides disaster resilience. I'm also using <a href=\"https://github.com/drakkan/sftpgo\">SFTPGo</a> to securely sync a desktop to the server repo as well.</li>\n<li><strong>LastPass</strong> - <a href=\"https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden\">VaultWarden</a>. The great thing about VaultWarden is you can still use all the great Android and browser apps from BitWarden, but self hosted. Field detection seemed even better than in LastPass, and I was able to migrate everything over without too much trouble, removing many duplicates because VaultWarden supports multiple URI entries and detection schemes.</li>\n<li><strong>Netflix</strong> - <a href=\"https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin\">Jellyfin</a>. I chose Jellyfin over Plex because of the recent controversy surrounding them, and I haven't regretted it. Android and Roku based apps allowed me to use it as a drop in replacement fairly easily, and the range of metadata collection plugins and options allowed me to nicely display my entire diverse library. There's an ecosystem springing up around it with apps like <a href=\"https://github.com/Fallenbagel/jellyseerr\">JellySeerr</a> to make it increasingly competitive as well compared to Plex.</li>\n<li><strong>Amazon Music</strong> - Also Jellyfin, surprisingly. It provides options for instant mixes and selections by genre, album, etc. Some work with <a href=\"https://picard.musicbrainz.org/\">Music Brainz Picard</a> and I began to actually listen to my old music collection again.</li>\n<li><strong>Mint</strong> - <a href=\"https://github.com/firefly-iii/firefly-iii\">Firefly III</a>. I love the graphs on this app and the broad display of information. Also very configurable with rules and webhooks. The <a href=\"https://github.com/firefly-iii/data-importer\">data import tool</a> supports configurable CSV import as well which made getting everything setup easier when I had different formats from different cards. I considered <a href=\"https://github.com/actualbudget/actual\">Actual</a>, which is much more lightweight, but also has fewer features.</li>\n<li><strong>Feedly</strong> - <a href=\"https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS\">FreshRSS</a>. Nicely configurable with plugins and options, I was even able to use <a href=\"https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub\">RSSHub</a> for custom RSS feeds as well to replace some old bookmarks I occasionally monitored.</li>\n<li><strong>PushBullet</strong> - <a href=\"https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy\">Ntfy</a>. I use it to pass links or other info to my phone, occasionally, or just small files I might want if I don't feel like uploading them. On top of being useful as an alert tool if something goes wrong.</li>\n<li><strong>Youtube</strong> - <a href=\"https://github.com/Tzahi12345/YoutubeDL-Material\">YoutubeDL Material</a>. I was able to configure it to automatically download my Youtube Subscriptions, and then using the <a href=\"https://github.com/ankenyr/jellyfin-youtube-metadata-plugin\">JellyFin Youtube MetaData Plugin</a>, label it nicely, rename the file, and prepare it for display on Jellyfin. It also has a browser add-in which allows quickly passing a link to the server instance for downloading videos or just mp3s from a wide variety of sources automatically, which I've also pathed to folders Jellyfin monitors.</li>\n</ul>",

As many of us, I started small. Spawning a first home dashboard and then getting my hands dirty with Docker, Proxmox, DNS, reverse proxying etc. My first hardware was a Raspberry Pi 3. Good times!</p>\n<p>As of today, I am running various dockerized services in my homelab (50+). I have tried K3S but still rock Docker Compose productively and expose everything using Traefik. As the services keep growing and so my `docker-compose.yml` files, I fairly quickly started pushing my configs in a private Gitea repository.</p>\n<p>After a while, I noticed that friends and colleagues constantly reach out to me asking how I run this and that. So as you can imagine, I was quite busy handing over my compose examples as well as cleaning them up for sharing. Especially for those things that are not well documented by the FOSS maintainers itself. As those requests wen't havoc, I started cleaning up my private git repo and creating a public one. For me, for you, for all of us.</p>\n<p>I am sure many of you are aware of the Awesome-Selfhosted repository. It is often referenced in posts and comments as it contains various references to brilliant FOSS, which we all love to host. Today I aligned the readme of my public repo to the awesome-selhosted one. So it should be fairly easy to find stuff as it contains a table of content now.</p>\n<p>Here is the repo with 131 examples and over 3600 stars: </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Haxxnet/Compose-Examples\">https://github.com/Haxxnet/Compose-Examples</a></p>\n<p><strong>Frequently Asked Questions:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>How do you ensure that the provided compose examples are up-to-date?</em></li>\n<li>Many compose examples are run productively by myself. So if there is a major release or breaking code change, I will notice it by myself and update the repo accordingly. For everything else, I try to keep an eye on breaking changes. Sorry for any deprecated ones! If you as the community recognize a problem, please file a GitHub issue. I will then start fixing.</li>\n<li>A GitHub Action also validates each compose yml to ensure the syntax is correct. Therefore, less human error possible when crafting or copy-pasting such examples into the git repo.</li>\n<li><em>I've looked over the repo but cannot find X or Y.</em></li>\n<li>Sorry about that. The repo mostly contains examples I personally run or have run myself. A few of them are contributions from the community. May check out the repo of the maintainer and see whether a compose it provided. If not, create a GitHub issue at my repo and request an example. If you have a working example, feel free to provide it (see next FAQ point though).</li>\n<li><em>How do you select apps to include in your repository?</em></li>\n<li>The initial task was to include all compose examples I personally run. Then I added FOSS software that do not provide a compose example or are quite complex to define/structure/combine. In general, I want to refrain from adding things that are well documented by the maintainers itself. So if you can easily find a docker compose example at the maintainer's repo or public documentation, my repo will likely not add it if currently missing.</li>\n<li><em>What does the compose volume definition `${DOCKER_VOLUME_STORAGE:-/mnt/docker-volumes}` mean?</em></li>\n<li>This is a specific type of <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/compose/environment-variables/env-file/#interpolation\">environment variable definition</a>. It basically searches for a `<em>DOCKER_VOLUME_STORAGE</em>` environment variable on your Docker server. If it is not set, the bind volume mount path with fall-back to the path `/mnt/docker-volumes`. Otherwise, it will use the path set in the environment variable. We do this for many compose examples to have a unified place to store our persisted docker volume data. I personally have all data stored at `/mnt/docker-volumes/<container-stack-name>`. If you don't like this path, just set the env variable to your custom path and it will be overridden.</li>\n<li><em>Why do you store the volume data separate from the compose yaml files?</em></li>\n<li>I personally prefer to separate things. By adhering to separate paths, I can easily push my compose files in a private git repository. By using `git-crypt`, I can easily encrypt `.env` files with my secrets without exposing them in the git repo. As the docker volume data is at a separate Linux file path, there is no chance I accidentially commit those into my repo. On the other side, I have all volume data at one place. Can be easily backed up by Duplicati for example, as all container data is available at `/mnt/docker-volumes/`.</li>\n<li><em>Why do you put secrets in the compose file itself and not in a separate `.env`?</em></li>\n<li>The repo contains examples! So feel free to harden your environment and separate secrets in an env file or platform for secrets management. The examples are scoped for beginners and intermediates. Please harden your infrastructure and environment.</li>\n<li><em>Do you recommend Traefik over Caddy or Nginx Proxy Manager?</em></li>\n<li>Yes, always! Traefik is cloud native and explicitely designed for dockerized environments. Due to its labels it is very easy to expose stuff. Furthermore, we proceed in infrastructure as code, as you just need to define some labels in a `docker-compose.yml` file to expose a new service. I started by using Nginx Proxy Manager but quickly switched to Traefik.</li>\n<li><em>What services do you run in your homelab?</em></li>\n<li>Too many likely. Basically a good subset of those in the public GitHub repo. If you want specifics, ask in the comments.</li>\n<li><em>What server(s) do you use in your homelab?</em></li>\n<li>I opted for a single, power efficient NUC server. It is the HM90 EliteMini by Minisform. It runs Proxmox as hypervisor, has 64GB of RAM and a virtualized TrueNAS Core VM handles the SSD ZFS pool (mirror). The idle power consumption is about 15-20 W. Runs rock solid and has enough power for multiple VMs and nearly all selfhosted apps you can imagine (except for those AI/LLMS etc.).</li>\n</ul>",

I've started hosting many of my own services thanks to the advice and ideas here. I'm also security conscious, so one thing has me increasingly uneasy is how vocal people are about Tailscale as a good solution for \"self hosting\". I used Tailscale for a few months, but never found it quite as magical as some people seem to. Then, there was a post in December (<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/18evofr/a_word_of_caution_about_tailscale/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/18evofr/a_word_of_caution_about_tailscale/</a>) that raised this point and led to a really good discussion, and I decided it wasn't a good fit for me.</p>\n<p>I understand that Tailscale is easy to use, trusting them with everything just doesn't feel right to me. They are a business (with VCs to answer to), not a charity. Sometimes incentives like this are okay, but as an example, I don't want to think about Google having access to my email, so I don't use Gmail anymore. I know enough to understand that they can't simply read my network traffic, but they control the keys to every host, and even more importantly they will have a lot of metadata about me, and where I connect from.  </p>\n<p>And that brings me to the reason I finally decided to post something about this.. I happened across this job listing, and it is exactly the kind of thing that makes me uneasy about ever trusting a seemingly well-intentioned company: <a href=\"https://echojobs.io/job/tailscale-data-software-engineer-3rqib\">https://echojobs.io/job/tailscale-data-software-engineer-3rqib</a> This all but confirms they are data mining their users (or plan to), and I just want to make people aware of what they are signing up for here.  </p>\n<p>Am I overreacting? Maybe. But I really just don't like the idea of trading one big brother for another, and giving up yet another bit of privacy, which is already extremely difficult to maintain these days.</p>",

I am pleased to finally show the world <a href=\"https://github.com/reaper47/recipya\">Recipya</a>, the recipe manager software I have been working hard on since my first commit in May 2021. You might wonder why another recipes manager when we've got <a href=\"https://github.com/TandoorRecipes/recipes\">Tandoor</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/mealie-recipes/mealie\">Mealie</a>, <a href=\"https://www.paprikaapp.com/\">Paprika</a>, <a href=\"https://grocy.info/\">Grocy</a>, <a href=\"https://cooklist.com/\">Cooklist</a>, <a href=\"https://grossr.com/\">Grossr</a>, and a <a href=\"https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted#recipe-management\"><em>whole lot more</em></a>? The answer is simple: none of them satisfied my needs. Either they weren't free and opensource, had too many features I did not need, their frontend was slow, or they were too hard to install. Although I do have to admit Tandoor recipes is the king after having discovered it a few months back.</p>\n<p>And thus I started this ambitious project in <a href=\"https://go.dev\">Go</a>. The goal was to create a simple, clean and powerful recipe manager my whole family can enjoy. As with every other such solution, you can add recipes to your ever-growing collection of recipes, create cookbooks, view and print recipes. One big feature that Recipya from the others is its measurement systems module. Essentially, the software can convert all new recipes to your preferred measurement system, either the insatiable imperial or the mighty metric. Gone are the times when you convert all your teaspoons and cups to grams. Another powerful feature is the website scraper. Most other solutions are written in Python and thus use the <a href=\"https://github.com/hhursev/recipe-scrapers\">hhursev/recipe-scrapers</a> package to import recipes from around the web. As there are none written in Go, I decided to create <a href=\"https://github.com/reaper47/recipya/tree/main/internal/scraper\">my own</a> from scratch. It is extensively-tested and fully supports <a href=\"https://github.com/reaper47/recipya/blob/main/internal/services/migrations/20230522154229_websites.sql#L11\">264</a> websites at the time of this writing. Another cool feature of Recipya is the automatic calculation of the nutrition facts per 100g when adding a recipe. Check out the <a href=\"https://recipes.musicavis.ca/guide/docs/features/\">feature tour</a> to learn everything the software can do.</p>\n<p>Please give it a try! No worries if this software isn't for you :) The easiest way is to try the <a href=\"https://recipes.musicavis.ca\">demo</a>. Other ways include installing the <a href=\"https://recipes.musicavis.ca/guide/docs/installation/build/\">v1.0.0 release</a> locally or with <a href=\"https://recipes.musicavis.ca/guide/docs/installation/docker/\">Docker</a>. You can follow the installation <a href=\"https://recipes.musicavis.ca/guide/docs/installation/\">instructions</a>.</p>\n<p>And this marks the beginning of Recipya's journey. Contributions are <a href=\"https://recipes.musicavis.ca/guide/about/community-guide/\">encouraged and welcome</a>. The roadmap is available <a href=\"https://recipes.musicavis.ca/guide/about/roadmap/\">here</a>. Thank you!</p>",

If you are a self-hosting gamer, you most likely <a href=\"https://gamevau.lt\">want to check this out.</a></p>\n<p>With the brand new version 1.8, we've taken your feedback to heart and worked hard to give GameVault a fresh coat of paint!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/kcy2D0W.jpg\">Here are some before/after pics</a> of how it used to look versus now so you can see the difference.</p>\n<p>The UI underwent a complete makeover, and aside from looking pretty awesome, it is much better in terms of usability as well.</p>\n<p>Just so you know: The first UI was kind of basic and only meant for us two developers, as we didn't initially plan to release this project to the public.</p>\n<p>Now that the traction is <strong>so huge</strong> and thousands of people are using this software, it would plainly feel wrong not to give it a facelift. So, every button and detail has been thoughtfully placed to make things <strong>way more user-friendly</strong>.</p>\n<p>If you weren't a fan of the old UI, now's the time to swing by and check out the changes.</p>\n<p>If you also want to steer the future development of GameVault, make sure to join our <a href=\"https://discord.gg/NEdNen2dSu\">Discord Server</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>You can check out GameVault</strong> <a href=\"https://gamevau.lt\"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>",

I know privacy and security are essential to this subreddit, and they're very important to me as well. </p>\n<p><strong>Homeway has a very strong</strong> <a href=\"https://learn.homeway.io/privacy/\">privacy</a> <strong>and</strong> <a href=\"https://learn.homeway.io/security\">security</a> <strong>commitment; we will never sell, store, or give away your data.</strong> Homeway tunnels your data from your browser to your Home Assistant and back, then it's deleted. All of your data stays locally in your home, I'm just building a secure way to access it. I have written an <a href=\"https://learn.homeway.io/security\">extensive page describing our system security</a>; I would like feedback and scrutiny!</p>\n<p>There are other remote access solutions, but I'm trying to build an easy-as-possible-to-use system that requires no setup, so there's no way to misconfigure the system and expose it to the public internet. I have worked in software and security for 10 years, so I have seen the user benefits of systems that are drop-dead easy to set up and have seen the horrors of security issues resulting from poor attention to security.</p>\n<p>I want the service to be free so that as many people can secure their Home Assistant remote access. However, the service does cost money to operate, so users can opt into an option supporter role for $2.49/month, which helps fund the project. If you get the supporter role, you get higher limits on your data usage as a thank-you.</p>\n<p><strong>I'm looking for beta testers to run the project through its paces and send feedback</strong>. I'm an open book and would love to communicate with anyone on their thoughts, concerns, bugs, or whatever. For this initial set of beta testers, if you contribute feedback, as a thank you, <strong>I will give all beta testers \"Supporter Perks\" for life, essentially meaning unlimited free remote access forever.</strong></p>\n<p>If you're interested, <a href=\"https://homeway.io/getstarted?source=reddit_selfhost\">follow this link to get set up in about 20 seconds</a>. All you have to do is install the Homeway add-on and link your account.</p>\n<p>I'm excited to get some users into my project and see what you all think! I'm more than happy to answer any questions, fire away!</p>",

This was my post: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/18gh5oy/do_you_selfhost_git_repos_too/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/18gh5oy/do_you_selfhost_git_repos_too/</a>. I had mentioned that initially I got bashed for building a GUI tool and I got very kind responses on the post which encouraged me to keep doing what I love to do!</p>\n<p>Quite a few mentioned that they cannot use my tool as it is not open-source. I am happy to announce that I have open-sourced it under <strong>MIT License</strong> and here is the repo:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/productiveops/dokemon\">https://github.com/productiveops/dokemon</a></p>\n<p><strong>Why it was not open-source earlier?</strong></p>\n<p>I used to be a .NET developer before I moved into DevOps. The project started as an excuse for me to learn the latest development technologies. Dokemon is written in Golang and React. One reason I had not open-sourced it earlier was I am new to both these languages/frameworks and I was nervous of people judging my code. :) It is not that bad but still it made me nervous.</p>\n<p>I had planned to complete all the basic functionality, then refactor the code, then setup coding standards, etc. and then open-source it. I have not reached this stage yet, but as many cannot use it for not being open-source, I gathered courage and decided to open-source it right away! I will slowly keep on building it and refactoring the code as I go along.</p>\n<p>After my previous post I added a few new features: support for Variables and Environments and Dark Mode! :)</p>\n<p>Here is repo once again:</p>\n<p><strong>Dokemon Code Repo</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/productiveops/dokemon\">https://github.com/productiveops/dokemon</a></p>\n<p>Do give it a STAR on GitHub if you like the project :)</p>",

The project has grown so much in terms of users, developers, features, maturity, and the community around it. When I started working on Immich, it was simply a challenge for myself and an opportunity to learn new technologies, crafting something fun and useful for my wife during my free time to satisfy my urge to build and create things. I never thought it would become so popular and help so many people. At the end of the day, all we have is memory. I am proud that the team and I have created something to make storing and viewing those precious memories easier without restrictions and without sacrificing our privacy. As the year closes, here\u2019s a recap of everything the project accomplished in 2023.</p>\n<p>Milestones</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Public shared links</li>\n<li>Favorites page</li>\n<li>Immich turned 1</li>\n<li>Material Design 3 on the mobile app</li>\n<li>Auto-link LivePhotos server-side</li>\n<li>iOS background backup</li>\n<li>Explore page</li>\n<li>CLIP search</li>\n<li>Search by metadata</li>\n<li>Responsive web app</li>\n<li>Archive page</li>\n<li>Asset descriptions</li>\n<li>10,000 stars on GitHub</li>\n<li>Manage auth devices</li>\n<li>Map view</li>\n<li>Facial recognition, clustering, searching, renaming, and person management</li>\n<li>Partner sharing and unifying timeline between partners' users</li>\n<li>Custom storage label</li>\n<li>XMP sidecar reading</li>\n<li>RAW file formats</li>\n<li>Justified layout on the web</li>\n<li>Memories</li>\n<li>Multi-select via SHIFT</li>\n<li>Android Motion Photos</li>\n<li>360\u00b0 Photos</li>\n<li>Album description</li>\n<li>Album performance improvements (time buckets)</li>\n<li>Video hardware transcoding</li>\n<li>Slideshow mode on the web</li>\n<li>Configuration file</li>\n<li>External libraries</li>\n<li>Trash page</li>\n<li>Custom theme</li>\n<li>Asset Stacking</li>\n<li>20,000 stars on GitHub </li>\n<li>Shared album activity and comments</li>\n<li>CLI v2</li>\n<li>Down to 5 containers (from 8)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Fun Statistics</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We have gone from the release version `1.41.0` to `1.90.0` at the time of writing.

Bugs will continue to be squashed and conquered. \u201cShit Alex wrote'' code will continue to be replaced by beautiful, clean code from Jason, Zack, Boet, Daniel, Osorin, Mert, Fynn, Marty, Martin, and Jonathan. The team has my eternal gratitude for creating a welcoming environment for new contributors, helping, teaching, and learning from each other. I\u2019ve realized that hardly a day has gone by where the team hasn\u2019t been in communication about Immich related topics over the past year.</p>\n<p>My long-term goal is to help hone Immich into a diamond in the FOSS space, where the UI, UX, development experiences, documentation, and quality are at a high standard while remaining free for everybody to use.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy Immich and have a happy and peaceful holiday.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Alex and the Immich Team</p>\n<p>Cheers! \ud83c\udf86\ud83c\udf86</p>",

With a simple change to their TOS this company can do all sorts of things, including charging for a previously free product or monetizing whatever data that can get from you.</p>\n<p>If there's one thing that we should all already know about VC funded internet startups, it's that they can and will pull the rug from underneath you when their bottom line demands it. See: streaming services cutting content while raising costs, sites like youtube and reddit redesigning to add more and more ads, hashicorp going from open source to close source. There's countless others. </p>\n<p>In the beginning there is often a honey moon period when a company is flush from cash from VC rounds and is in a \"growth at all costs\" mentality where they essentially subsidize the cost of services for new users and often offer things like a free tier. This is where Tailscale is today. Over time they eventually shift into a profit mentality when they've shored up as much of the market as they can (which Tailscale has already done a great job of).</p>\n<p>I'm not saying don't use Tailscale, or that it's a bad service (on the contrary their product UX is incredible and you can't get better than free), just that it's praise in this subreddit feels misplaced. Relying on a software-as-a-service company for your networking feels very much against the philosophy of self hosting.</p>",

I connected the Firestick and my other devices to the router before I left. At the hotel, I plugged my router in, connected it the wifi, and all my devices were then connected. I then was able to seamlessly stream directly from my home server using jellyfin and tailscale. It was awesome.</p>",

The process requires mastering various layers of the cloud stack, IAM roles, networking, and numerous tools, along with finding creative ways to test and debug code. In addition, long deployment times hinder iteration cycles and take me out of my creative flow.</p>\n<p>Other development disciplines have benefited from smart compilers that handle the lower levels of the stack and reduce developers' cognitive load. With Wing, we aim to bring the same benefits to cloud development with a language that treats the entire cloud as its target computer.</p>\n<h1>How to get Involved</h1>\n<p>We'd love to hear your feedback on any aspect of the project, and we're looking for developers to join our community to help shape Winglang's future.</p>\n<p>If you find Winglang interesting, please <a href=\"https://github.com/winglang/wing\">give us a \u2b50\ufe0f</a> on GitHub to bring the project to the attention of more developers \ud83d\ude4f. Your support is greatly appreciated!</p>\n<p>More Info</p>\n<p>You can find more info, including how to get started with Wing and why we're building it as a language, in our GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/winglang/wing\">https://github.com/winglang/wing</a>.</p>",

I plan to start a transactional email service.</p>\n<p>I bought a range and rented another /24 range because I didn't want to have a bad neighbour on the subnet. I even got my own ASN because jerks like UCEProtect often put big ISPs on a blacklist at the ASN level.</p>\n<p>Of course, I have got a decent\u00a0experience with this.

The email was delivered 100% of the time to Gmail, but not at all to Yahoo and Outlook. The delivery rate to these two companies started to get better around last week, though. Some IP addresses started getting a 100% delivery rate.</p>\n<p>Then, I started testing my service on one of my websites. Of course, 100% transactional emails with account confirmation links ONLY. It was working great. Nearly 2,000 emails, 3,000+ opens and about 2,500 clicks daily on an average.</p>\n<p>I've also subscribed to Glock Apps and MXToolbox to measure my email deliverability and monitor IPs.</p>\n<p>Just today, I received an email with all half of my active IP addresses and sending/tracking domain blacklisted by Spamhaus. They categorize it under \"spam domain\", but I looked through my server logs (yes, everything is logged) and found no evidence of spam. Only transactional and warmup emails sent. I opened a ticket with Spamhaus and refuse to unblock my IP addresses and domains.</p>\n<p>I spent 6 months and $20,000+ working on this, only to be butchered by Spamhaus. How can Spamhaus be the police, judge and the executioner?</p>",

I discovered this do-it-yourself VPN solution about half a year ago and boy has it improved my life... Here is what I managed to accomplish with it.</p>\n<p>I am running Tailscale on my old macbook air, henceforth referred to as my \"server\", my two firesticks, and my phones.</p>\n<p>*remotely=outside of LAN, so over internet*</p>\n<p>-I can access my SMB shares remotely from my phones with OwlFiles and from my M1 Macbook air seamlessly through Finder. All I had to do was enter a simple command on my server in Terminal to add TCP/445 to \"Services\". Tailscale then forwards incoming TCP connections on port 445 from within my tailnet to port 445 on my mac\u2019s server. The result is that I am able to mount my 2TB share from anywhere I have internet and manage my files as though I was on my home network. I also have access to my entire media library from VLC installed on all my devices (once again, through SMB). If only I could somehow add my remote SMB shares to Kodi... But Kodi doesn't seem to allow me to type in custom IP addresses when trying to add SMB shares. Let me know in the comments if you know how to add remote SMB shares to Kodi (the ones it does not detect automatically).</p>\n<p>-Similarly, by adding a suitable HTTPS port to my server's Tailscale services, I am able to manage the Transmission torrent client installed on my server remotely through Transmission's web interface (while connected to Tailscale, of course).</p>\n<p>-I can back up to Time Machine remotely and accessing my Time Machine backups remotely as well. There are a few caveats though. On my server, I had to add a shared folder (from Settings), allow access to it via SMB and mark it as a Time Machine backup destination. The process is pretty straightforward. The trick is to add it as a backup destination THROUGH TAILSCALE by typing in the Tailscale IP of your server or the Magic-DNS domain name. Also, you will not be able to access pre-existing time machine backups through Tailscale! Only the destinations that you initially add through Tailscale. This is why I have two backup destinations on my server - one that I back up to from my LAN and one that I use over Tailscale remotely. Works like a charm!!!</p>\n<p>-I can control my server through VNC remotely and seamlessly as if I was connected to LAN. To do that, I had to add TCP/5900 to my server's Tailscale services (which is akin to opening up TCP port 5900 to incoming connections from within the tailnet). This is particularly useful when I don't have my M1 mac with me, but need to run Python code inside Spyder. I just turn on my bluetooth/trackpad combo, connect it to my S10+, jack myself into my tailnet, MultiVNC my way into my server and BAM.</p>\n<p>-MagicDNS deserves its own praiseful review. Not only did it assign a permanent, simple domain name to all my Tailscale-enabled devices, but it allowed me to configure my own DNS server for Tailscale-connected devices. I was then able to choose custom DNS servers for specific domains, which let me block FireTV updates without compromising my security (The DNS server used for that looks a little sketchy so I don\u2019t want all of my DNS requests to go through it) and also use AdGuard DNS without breaking Doordash\u2019s Dasher app by routing doordash-specific DNS requests to Google\u2019s DNS and not AdGuard\u2019s. Solid win here, as Adguard's DNS bricks the Dasher app. Let me know in the comments if you want to see my Magic-DNS configuration.</p>\n<p>-FUNNEL: By running a funnel (proxy) on my home server, I am able to access my dad's Bell Fibe TV channels through their web interface from anywhere on Earth - Bell treats my traffic as if it's coming from my home network! It will NOT work if you use the mobile app, but works flawlessly from within Samsung Internet, Safari (on mac) and Grazing 3 (on iOS). Also, it\u2019s quite neat to browse with my Canadian IP even when I am travelling (no more annoying \"cookie consent\" notices when in the EU). I suspect Netflix users could use this sort of setup to get around password-sharing restrictions. I am also running funnels on my firesticks just in case I need more bandwidth.</p>\n<p>-SUBNETS: I am running a subnet on my home server so that I could adb into my firesticks and manage them remotely with scrcpy (update apps, install tweaks, etc). Yes, I am not a huge fan of the command line \\^\\^' . I can also access my wifi cameras remotely from my mac. The desktop app for the cheap chinese ones only allows you to manage them over LAN, but Tailscale takes care of that. Works like a charm!</p>\n<p>I am beyond pleased with everything Tailscale enables me to do. It baffles me that this technology is somehow free to use. I am extremely grateful to be a part of the Tailscale community. Thank you!!</p>\n<p>Share your ideas and questions in the comments.</p>",

Even though I tried many options, none of them really appealed to me. The built-in bookmark managers in browsers were too basic and didn't allow me to organize my bookmarks in a way that made sense to me. The most popular external bookmark managers have been too simple, too complicated, or too expensive for what they offer.</p>\n<p>What I liked the most was the idea of having a bookmark manager with a relational database I had access to. This would let me retrieve my bookmarks in any way I wanted, and I could easily add new features in the future. I've searched for a solution that would allow me to do that, but I couldn't find anything that would fit my needs.</p>\n<p>And that's how the idea of the Grimoire was born. I wanted to create a bookmark manager that would be simple to use, but also powerful enough to let me organize my bookmarks in a way that made sense to me. Moreover, I wanted to take SvelteKit and PocketBase for a spin, and this seemed like a perfect opportunity to do so.</p>\n<h2>How it looks now<a href=\"https://grimoire.pro/blog/launch-time#how-it-looks-now\">\u200b</a></h2>\n<p>Starting with v0.1.0, Grimoire has most of the basic features you would expect from a bookmark manager:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>bookmarks:</li>\n<li>can be added, viewed, edited, and deleted</li>\n<li>can be organized into categories and tagged</li>\n<li>metadata, like title, description, HTML content, favicon, and image, is fetched from the website and stored locally</li>\n<li>can have notes added to them</li>\n<li>bookmark list:</li>\n<li>display in a grid or list view</li>\n<li>can be searched by title, description, URL, and tags</li>\n<li>filtering by category, tag, and and more</li>\n<li>sort by date added, domain, and more</li>\n<li>users:</li>\n<li>can sign up and sign in</li>\n<li>all bookmarks, categories, and tags are private to the user</li>\n<li>admin panel:</li>\n<li>is used to manage users and see their bookmark, category, and tag counts</li>\n<li>can be used to preview most of PocketBase settings</li>\n<li>other:</li>\n<li>it's dockerized, so it's easy to run it locally or deploy it to your server</li>\n<li>all the benefits of a self-hosted PocketBase installation, like scheduled backups (local and to S3), high performance, and data security</li>\n<li>dark mode, because dark wizardry requires darkness</li>\n<li>responsive design as magic should be accessible to everyone, everywhere</li>\n<li>early and experimental support for AI-powered features (more on that in the future), like automatic tag suggestions</li>\n<li>and that's just the beginning!</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What's next<a href=\"https://grimoire.pro/blog/launch-time#whats-next\">\u200b</a></h2>\n<p>It's still a work in progress, but I'm happy with the functionality provided so far. You can expect more useful features, like a way to import bookmarks from other services and export them to most popular file formats, public profiles, better admin panel, AI-powered features - just to name a few.

I loved Spore, from the time I got it for my 10th birthday to maybe the age of 16 or 17 I poured hundreds or probably thousands of hours into this game. As I got older I became less invested in the gameplay and more invested in the creative aspect of it. I designed some badass creatures and spaceships that I was really proud of. I had a whole line of Spaceships that all served different roles in my head cannon, with different races of aliens following different themes. </p>\n<p>EA/Maxis/whoever runs Spore now purged all of them from spore.com, and now they're gone.

To be clear, this is Plex telling other people what I've been watching from <em>my</em> server, with <em>my</em> files, and this is not OK. It also shows me what <em>they</em> have been watching on <em>their</em> server with <em>their</em> files. <strong>This is not OK!</strong></p>\n<p>https://imgur.com/a/DYR4wlh</p>\n<p>We all knew it was a matter of time before Plex started collecting data on our libraries and sharing it with advertisers. What happened to their \"we don't know, and don't want to know, what is on your server\"?. This, for me, is proof that those fears were absolutely founded in reality. On what planet would I ever want this information to be shared with friends on family on an OPT OUT basis? </p>\n<p>It's totally unacceptable to collect this data in the first place. It's totally unacceptable to share this information with uniquely identifiable information. And it's totally unacceptable to do this without explicitly asking me if it's OK. </p>\n<p>Unfortunately there is nothing you can do about this as a server admin, because technically these are <em>Plex</em> users and their marketing email preferences are controlled on the user side in the Plex website preferences. Not on your server.</p>\n<p><strong>This is an absolutely egregious overreach.</strong></p>\n<p>Thank goodness there are alternatives available in the form of Jellyfin and Emby.

A lot of software have graphs, but they start populating only when you open the webpage, and then the data is forgotten when you close it. Cosmos has a fully persistent 24/7 highly optimizedd data gathering system, so that all graph shows data at all time.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/oqz4j9ubm3zb1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d511a33d99e72332264e89d2d4befdad728149c\">Graaaphs</a></p>\n<p>Why doing this? Isn't it a lot of storage? This is a good question: Monitoring is useless if it's not being looked at. And if not persistent, not only you have to be very lucky to open the webpage at the right time  to detect a problem, but also you can't have an alert system, which is the core of any good monitoring.</p>\n<p>But worry not, Cosmos has a pipeline that optimize your data in real time: the older the data, the less precise they get, in order to save your storage. It is also highly optimized in order to keep the RAM and CPU usage extremely low, even on very cheap servers. Monitoring is difficult to get right but I think you will find this will hit the spot!</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ulh4jgufm3zb1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b74f79b77afd73a807461a05329673ea5dd5c35\">Customizable alerts</a></p>\n<p>So how do you use this awesome tool? When designing it, I was very conscious of thinking \"how will users use it\". I did not want to just show graphs for the sake of having graphs, that is why I imagined an entire workflow, that starts in the dashboard.</p>\n<p>You see, you can zoom in and out of the graphs (you can test this in the demo: <a href=\"https://cosmos-cloud.io/cosmos-ui/\">https://cosmos-cloud.io/cosmos-ui/</a>) and when you do so, all the graph and the data in the tables are updating everywhere as you navigate. For example, highlight a peak of resources, and the right hand side table will tell you which container caused the resources peak:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/jdy0p8vim3zb1.png?width=1599&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01f9e661a68c73635fd4312916b36fddfa55dec0\">synchronizing, but also all the other graphs are changing at the same time</a></p>\n<p>Once you have identified a potential culprit, you can click on it to get their isolated metric:</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/y74tz3anm3zb1.png?width=1369&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79f59d70cdb988dc869b054746136d157525f515\">Looks like we have a culprit!</a></p>\n<p>You might think, \"alright pretty cool\", but it's over! Now that we know \"who\" caused  the issue, we might also want to know why. For this, we want to go to the last tab: \"events\". This is an improved version of logs with advanced search  (including BSON requests). That screen will tell us what happened. That screen also is synchronized with zooming into the graphs!</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/cmeqnfuqm3zb1.png?width=1584&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=50f90cad29cd4837523f13207e416b6df38329f2\">Looks like someone tried to force the shield!</a></p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Alright so that's neat, but also graphs are just pretty so I added them everywhere! Home screen, URL screen, container screen...</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/cxnm52jum3zb1.png?width=1666&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25ed7ce709f697f8d95bed365c7f413d0a9e1a64\">I will let you discover the other places ;)</a></p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>So anything else in that already huge updates?

I don't want them to be discouraged because of FUD, as they say in the crypto community. Here goes...  </p>\n<p>I am the type of person who loves to solve problems and am always up for a challenge. Since getting into the self-hosting hobby, I have continuously searched for the next fun and practical service to self-host, which I am sure is what all of us do quite regularly. For me, that next service was email. I didn't have a clue where to begin, so I began to read into it, and immediately I noticed a pattern that was clear as day and consistent across all discussion boards including this one, and that message was \"self-hosting email is not worth the trouble\". The warnings made me very curious, and I just had to try for myself to see what this fearmongering about self-hosted email was. Well, I'm here to tell you that in my experience, all the warnings and cautions were nonsense and so far non-existent. I'll tell you right off the bat that there was zero magic involved. All I did was the following:  </p>\n<p>#1. Obtained a static IP from my ISP<br />\n#2. Chose Synology MailPlus on my NAS as my mail server<br />\n#3. Purchased a domain on <a href=\"https://www.porkbun.com\">www.porkbun.com</a> <br />\n#4. Followed the instructions on <a href=\"https://youtu.be/o66UFsodUYo?si=4GDATwQJtYsY2IT2\">this video</a><br />\n#5. Made sure all firewall rules on both my router and NAS are properly configured  </p>\n<p>That's it. Simple as that. Works great for sending and receiving mail. I have run numerous tests, and it's been rock solid for about 6 months now. Never had a single email lost or end up in junk mail folders with any of the big email providers. My advice is, if you are interested in hosting your own email and are on the fence because of the FUD that has been peddled across self-hosting communities, don't buy into that cynicism. It's perfectly doable, and I didn't find a single moment of it to be frustrating, despite not being exactly the most advanced user in this field.  </p>\n<p>If this post encourages just one person to pull the trigger, I'm happy</p>",

They also offered a version called \"pfSense Plus\" which was paid and offered a few more features but also support from Netgate, which is of course perfectly fine and very common (look at Proxmox for example).</p>\n<p>A while ago (1,5 years) they introduced \"<strong>Home+Lab</strong>\" as a product and license version in order for casual users and \"homelabbers\" to dip a toe into their commercial offerings which has more features than the CE. Basically like \"here you can use your enterprise version for free, but its a bit limited of course\". The obvious goal there is to motivate users to switch from the free CE to a paid version, again nothing wrong with that. <a href=\"https://www.portainer.io/take-3\">Portainer for example does this too</a>.</p>\n<p>Because of this, users switched from the \"always\" free CE version to the \"Home+Lab\" version, upgrading their installations and enjoying a few more features. According to Netgate, thousands of users have installed it. Great!</p>\n<hr />\n<h1>Now</h1>\n<p>But just now <a href=\"https://www.netgate.com/blog/addressing-changes-to-pfsense-plus-homelab\">Netgate have announced</a> major changes to this, out of the blue, <strong>without any prior notice</strong>. The free \"Home+Lab\" version is no longer available for download, its just gone.</p>\n<p>As a reason they cite that thirdparty sellers (on Aliexpress etc. i imagine) were downloading the \"better\" version of pfSense, aka the \"Home+Lab\" version, and installing it on their hardware appliances and then selling them. Without Netgate seeing any revenue from this. </p>\n<hr />\n<p>Please see <a href=\"https://www.netgate.com/blog/addressing-changes-to-pfsense-plus-homelab\">their blogpost</a> for all the details. But one crucial point is that anyone who is currently running their \"Home+Lab\" version, can keep running it (yay!) but they also say that <strong>future upgrades and bugfixes may require a subscription</strong>. So basically, users installed a free \"better\" version, which now doesnt exist anymore, and to continue using it with updates, they \"might\" need to pay a subscription fee. Something as crucial like a firewall appliance should be kept up to date for security, so just ignoring that is not really a option. And Netgate also state that if you have to reinstall your current \"Home+Lab\" version, they cannot provide that for free to you. And those subscriptions apparently come at a very high price. <strong>Are you willing to pay $400/year for your firewall software when youre only using it privately in your small homelab?</strong></p>\n<p>Paying for software, or any product, is not a bad thing. And companies need to make money, they need to pay employees. This should be obvious. There is no problem with that in itself. But the way this was done, telling their userbase for quite a while to try out this free version of the premium product, and then pulling the rug away underneath the feet, is just plain wrong and fucked up.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>\"Okay whatever, then just switch back to the actual free CE version!\"</em> Great idea, but apparently thats not so super easy.</p>\n<p><strong>Lawrence Systems</strong> have already made a excellent video summing up all these changes. I would recommend watching it to get the full picture, i can and want to only cover a bit here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXI6-E1nc5M\">Addressing Licence Changes to pfSense Plus Home and Lab</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>They also made a video about switching back from pfSense plus (aka Home+Lab?) to pfSense CE:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFUcmWTazGg\">How to Convert From pfsense plus 23.05 to pfsense CE 2.7</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Reading recent posts about this on /r/pfSense subreddit, the community seems to be quite angry about this. And it doesnt help that their subreddit is actually run by Netgate employees, so it isnt exactly a independent discussion forum there at all. For example a user tried to get feedback and support for <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/17hs7o2/bounty_for_pfsense_to_opnsense_conversion/\">a tool to convert pfSense configs to OPNsense configs</a>, and the moderators removed the post without further comment.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>My personal recommendation would be that this is a huge opportunity to finally switch away from pfSense, they have shown once again that they cannot be trusted. Take a look at the most obvious \"competitor\" /r/OPNsense /r/OPNsenseFirewall, they started as a fork of pfSense and have developed quite nicely.</p>\n<p>And to make it even more clear what kind of people are running Netgate (pfSense), if you havent read it yet, <a href=\"https://opnsense.org/opnsense-com/\">this is the story</a> of when users announced the fork OPNsense, how a <strong>employee of Netgate</strong> was running <code>opnsense.com</code> which was a mock website <strong>entirely made to shit on the OPNsense project and discredit them</strong>. <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20160314132836/http:/www.opnsense.com/\">I encourage you to look at it and make up your own mind about it</a>. And yes, <a href=\"https://www.netgate.com/blog/author/jamie-thompson\">this employee still works for them today it seems</a>. This alone should be reason enough to <strong>never use anything by Netgate</strong>, ever, wether its a free CE or paid.</p>\n<p>Atleast right now they are still offering the free and opensource CE version. But who knows how long that will last. They might as well kill that option without prior notice in a few months or a year from now. Its better to think about switching before being forced to.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>There have also been various other issues with Netgate\u00b4s behaviour towards their users over the years, but covering them all here would be too much and offtopic, i would like to focus this post mostly on the very recent issue.</p>\n<p>If people get angry about Oracle and seemingly shutting down \"free\" VPS instances at random, then they should be angry about Netgate pulling shit like this too.</p>\n<hr />\n<h1>TL;DR</h1>\n<p><strong>Stop using pfSense (just any Netgate products), switch to something else.</strong></p>\n<p>Its not the only alternative, but /r/OPNsense /r/OPNsenseFirewall is one major example.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Disclaimer: I am no pfSense expert, very far from it. If i got any of the history or current events wrong in this post, please let me know and i will immediately correct them. For me when the time came to pick a (virtualized) firewall/router appliance, i installed both pfSense and OPNsense in VMs and took a quick look. Even tho pfSense did leave a very \"enterprise-ish\" impression, it didnt feel right somehow, just odd in some way. Then looking at OPNsense, i felt immediately at home, i cant really narrow down why exactly. It simply felt much more open and friendly from the beginning. And i mean the software, at that point i had no idea what was going on between pfSense and OPNsense. All i knew was that OPNsense originated from pfSense, thats all. I tried both a tiny bit and quickly decided that i like OPNsense more, and thats what i have been using for a long time now and im very happy with it.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>None of the existing flair options seem to really fit to this, so forgive me for not having any flair. Mods feel free to overwrite any flair to this. And if a post about Jellyfins future is fitting here, then imo a post about demise of pfSense should be allowed too.</em></p>",

But then, I stumbled upon \"selfhosted\" by accident while researching a different app, which led me to the world of open-source software \u2013 something I had no prior knowledge of. When I realized I had to set up a server, I was in for a surprise.</p>\n<p>A kind soul directed me to the \"selfhosted\" subreddit. Spending an entire evening there opened my eyes to a world of possibilities I never knew existed. I had no idea you could do this. The reality hit me hard \u2013 I wasn't as smart as I thought.</p>\n<p>For the next four days, I immersed myself in learning how to host my own media server. It was challenging, especially since I'm not a programmer and had zero knowledge about dockers or containers. ChatGPT became my ally, helping me understand complex concepts in simple terms.</p>\n<p>Last night, I successfully set up my media server on an old gaming laptop using Jellyfin, Sonarr, Radarr, Requestrr, Jackett, and Heimdall. I'm absolutely delighted, especially with Requestrr, which makes my life so much easier.</p>\n<p>Now, I'm eager to explore self-hosting even further by setting up a music library, ebooks, photos, videos, a password manager, and more. I've come across options like Lidarr for music and Readarr for books, but I'd love to hear your recommendations.</p>\n<p>Is there a way to use a similar server setup like Sonarr for managing music and ebooks? I've tried Openbooks and Kavita, but Openbooks was a pain to set up and Kavita seems to be a library manager without a download option. Can you recommend something that I can download and use offline on my mobile for music and ebooks please?</p>\n<p>On a special note, I want to express my heartfelt thanks to everyone who's been patient and supportive, especially those who answered challenging questions in the subreddit. You're all truly amazing, and your guidance means the world to me. A big shoutout to all of you!</p>\n<p>People like you are rare, and you deserve all the good things in life.</p>",

It's been a while!!</p>\n<p>I was cooking something that took a long time in order to get there, but Cosmos now has its own VPN: <strong>Constellation</strong>! </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/9duklk7srysb1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=718d279c6d902ab1a6efc16b86fd34f918375d56\">yes I do find this arrow funny</a></p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>As a reminder, this exists alongside the existing features:</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>App Store</strong> \ud83d\udce6\ud83d\udcf1 To easily install and manage your applications, with simple installers, automatic updates and security checks</li>\n<li><strong>Customizable Homepage</strong> \ud83c\udfe0\ud83d\uddbc To access all your applications from a single place, with a beautiful and customizable UI</li>\n<li><strong>Reverse-Proxy</strong> \ud83d\udd04\ud83d\udd17 Targeting containers, other servers, or serving static folders / SPA with <strong>automatic HTTPS</strong>, and a <strong>nice UI</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Authentication Server</strong> \ud83d\udc66\ud83d\udc69 With strong security, <strong>multi-factor authentication</strong> and multiple strategies (<strong>OpenId</strong>, forward headers, HTML)</li>\n<li><strong>Container manager</strong>    \ud83d\udc0b\ud83d\udd27  To easily manage your containers and their settings, keep them   up  to  date as well as audit their security. Includes docker-compose    support!</li>\n<li><strong>Identity Provider</strong> \ud83d\udc66\ud83d\udc69 To easily manage your users, <strong>invite your friends and family</strong>     to your applications without awkardly sharing credentials. Let them     request a password change with an email rather than having you unlock     their account manually!</li>\n<li><strong>SmartShield technology</strong>    \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udee1  Automatically secure your applications without manual   adjustments  (see  below for more details). Includes anti-bot and   anti-DDOS  strategies.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Let me put it straight: Constellation has been a hell of a ride to release. It has been 2 months of hard work, to ensure it is stable, secure, but also that it properly integrate with other components of Cosmos (especially the reverse proxy). This is what you get:</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Full mesh VPN with P2P</li>\n<li>Complete UI to manage your network and devices</li>\n<li>The UI includes letting your users manage their own devices</li>\n<li>An internal DNS with Adblock list, custom entries and  DNSSEC (think pihole + unbound)</li>\n<li>A basic client application</li>\n<li>An integration to the reverse proxy (to secure your servapps easily)</li>\n<li>Multi-server setup (to bypass CGNAT or access isolated private servers)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/c7uwhj0fsysb1.png?width=981&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c6980dcec992a6ed9c5eac84a1678223976fe98f\">Secure your URLs in one click!</a></p>\n<p>Constellation itself is based on Nebula but build upon it, and will continue to do so. Some of the planned features for Constellation are</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Exit Nodes</li>\n<li>Internal Firewalls</li>\n<li>Probably some container interactions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>I am still actively working on the client applications, for now only Android and Windows are available but the other ones will follow up soon!</p>\n<h1>Why would you use Constellation rather than alternatives like Cloudflare Tunnel or Tailscale?</h1>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Cloudflare Tunnel is <strong>not</strong> a very good practice for security: first of all it leaves your origin server in your local network unprotected, and it also let CLoudflare see all your decrypted network. Tailscale is a better alternative, but not quite in the \"self-hosted\" philosophy as it relies on distant cloud servers. Now the closest thing you will get to what Constellation does, is something like OpenZiti. What Constellation offers you on top of it is the integration to the reverse proxy and the automatic DNS. </p>\n<p>For example, one of the big issues of VPN setups is \"how to tunnel my stuff\". You have multiple choices: Tunnel everything (but then it impact your everyday browsing). Have 2 sets of domains, or manually maintain a DNS with overwrites (both being annoying to do). Instead, Constellation automatically rewrite all your reverse proxy URLs on the fly to be tunneled through the VPN. It is also a full split tunnel so you can leave it on at all time.</p>\n<p>Why would you <strong>not</strong> choose Constellation?</p>\n<p>The three main reasons would be: The application might not be available yet for your platform, you don't want to self-host the discovery server (in case you need one, ex. for CGNAT), or you need the exit node functionality (aka. proxy all your network through the server. No ETA on this feature for now).</p>\n<p>Aside from this, few improvement to this version, here's the full changelog:</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Added Constellation</li>\n<li>DNS Challenge is now used for all certificates when enabled [breaking change]</li>\n<li>Rework headers for better compatibility</li>\n<li>Improve experience for non-admin users</li>\n<li>Fix bug with redirect on logout</li>\n<li>Added OverwriteHostHeader to routes to override the host header sent to the target app</li>\n<li>Added WhitelistInboundIPs to routes to  filter incoming requests based on IP per URL</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>It's good \"to be back\" from this adventure, as I have been pretty low-profile while this was taking a lot of my time, hope you enjoy the update!</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>",

I originaly didn't want to post a new article (and on here) so quickly again, but I couldn't help myself.</p>\n<p>I really hope this article helps people out their.
