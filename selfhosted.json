One of the things that will most likely remain for foreseeable future is Synology Photos and Drive. I'm replacing practically everything else with other, mainly dockerized apps.</p>\n<p>As this is happening I'm becoming more and more aware that keeping track of all the different logins is a serious PITA, not to mention a big potential security risk. And on top of that it makes the whole thing less wife-friendly...</p>\n<p>So, how could I go about having a single account for all the services? Is this even doable in a reasonable way? I would actually even consider using a Google account, but as far as I know (I may very well be wrong) this can't be done if you don't have a Google Workspace account.</p>\n<p>My requirements/wishes are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>one account for all the home services</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>2FA support</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>transparent login. You login to one service and are authenticated by all (optional)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some of the services I'm running: Synology, Plex, *arr stuff, Ngingx proxy manager, Home Assistant, Linksys Velop, Portainer,...</p></div>",

Feel free to ask if you have any questions, I'll do my best to answer.</p>\n<p>TL;DR I wasted way too many afternoons in front of a terminal, but I wrote it down now so it's ok.</p>\n<h1>Hardware</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Raspberry Pi 4, 8GB of RAM</li>\n<li>2 Western Digital 4TB hard drives in an external <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/IcyBox-IB-3640SU3-External-JBOD-System/dp/B009DH5Q2S\">Icy Box enclosure</a>. They are setup in a RAID1 array with mdadm.</li>\n<li>a 256 GB SSD for the OS. I originally had a typical SD card but had some corruption issues, so I recently switched to an SSD.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Services</h1>\n<p>All the services are installed with Docker using docker-compose. The links below point to the image I'm using.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>OS : Raspberry Pi OS Lite (no desktop environment)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-sonarr\">Sonarr</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-radarr\">Radarr</a>:  management of TV Shows and Movies libraries</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-bazarr\">Bazarr</a>: subtitles download</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://hotio.dev/containers/prowlarr/\">Prowlarr</a> : torrent indexer (like Jackett, but in the *arr stack)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/guillaumedsde/alpine-qbittorrent-openvpn\">qBittorrent</a> : torrent downloader. The Docker image includes an OpenVPN client which is connected to my ProtonVPN account.</li>\n<li>Kodi : media player (the Pi is plugged into the TV). This is the only service that does not use Docker, I use the Raspbian package).</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://registry.hub.docker.com/r/jc21/nginx-proxy-manager\">Nginx Proxy Manager</a> : reverse  proxy. Each service is mapped to a subdomain of my domain name. This also handles the HTTPS certificates, and has a nice web UI to add new subdomains.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://registry.hub.docker.com/r/adguard/adguardhome\">AdGuard Home</a> : network-wide ad blocker. It's similar to PiHole, but I prefer the interface.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://registry.hub.docker.com/r/niruix/sshwifty\">Sshwifty</a> : ssh access in a browser</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://registry.hub.docker.com/r/portainer/portainer-ce\">Portainer</a> : to manage the containers</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://hub.docker.com/r/containrrr/watchtower\">Watchtower</a> : to update the containers.

I wrote a small Python script to spin them down when they haven't been used for 15 minutes.</li>\n<li>I have a weekly backup with <a href=\"https://rclone.org/\">rclone</a>, one to the hard drives and one to Backblaze B2. This backs up my home folder, where all the docker stuff is stored. I don't bother with backing up the system, as aside from a few apt packages it's a vanilla OS with some config to do</li>\n<li>A weekly housekeeping script does some cleanup (clean the Kodi library, run the backups, delete the obsolete Docker images, update the Linux packages)</li>\n<li>I use Telegram to receive all the notifications from my server. My own scripts use <a href=\"https://github.com/rahiel/telegram-send\">telegram-send</a> to do the same.</li>\n<li>Kodi, Sonarr and Radarr are connected to my Trakt account. Sonarr and Radarr pull from my Trakt watchlist to get new stuff to download, and Kodi scrobbles what I watch.</li>\n<li>I use <a href=\"https://woob.tech/\">woob</a> to retrieve some administrative documents via a Python script</li>\n<li>I use <a href=\"https://ddclient.net/\">ddclient</a> for the dynamic DNS</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Android apps</h1>\n<p>I figured I'd share the Android apps I recommend along with this setup:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.lunasea.lunasea\">LunaSea</a> : interface for Sonarr and Radar</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sonelli.juicessh\">Juice SSH</a> : for SSH</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jonathanantoine.TVST\">TV Shows tracker</a> (also handles movies) : it's linked to my Trakt account, which means I can just add a movie in there and it'll be downloaded by Radarr via its Trakt integration. </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.seazon.feedme\">FeedMe</a> : RSS reader</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://f-droid.org/fr/packages/org.tasks/\">Tasks</a> : to do list, synced with Nextcloud Tasks</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nextcloud.client\">Nextcloud</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.niedermann.owncloud.notes\">Nextcloud notes</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nutomic.syncthingandroid\">Syncthing</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.gaulupeau.apps.InThePoche\">Wallabag</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://f-droid.org/fr/packages/at.bitfire.davdroid/\">DavX5</a> : caldav sync with Nextcloud</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appgenix.bizcal\">Agenda Business</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h1>What I'd like to add next</h1>\n<p>For now I'm happy with what I'm hosting. I don't want to host anything too important like emails or password managers, I don't want to be forced to spend an afternoon debugging if I don't feel like it. However I'd lime to add a couple more services, but I haven't found a good app yet :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A parcel tracker</li>\n<li>A financial dashboard linked to my bank accounts. I found lots of budgeting apps, but I just want to see the current balance in several accounts.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Bonus: my Homer dashboard </p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/ntknqbogoan71.png?width=1388&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2239eb2eb5df63f7ad64549387a2223ee426165a</p></div>",

It is not really r/selfhosted material, but it somehow belongs here and I am curious to know if others had the same experience already.</p>\n<p>Ok short background, I am right now playing with a new server set-up. proxmox, opnsense, docker and last but not least caddy as reverse proxy. As you can see, many knobs and wheels, which can easily keep you busy for a few days.</p>\n<p>So right now I am looking into a problem that I can't resolve https requests to my docker containers with caddy in proxy-mode in-between. The point is I use a docker container for caddy, which creates the caddy config file on the fly, based on the keyword settings in the different docker-compose files. Thus, the idea is, you deal with config of caddy in docker-compose files, instead of having just another config file to take care of. </p>\n<p>As I face problems right now, I was looking into readmes, tutorials, blog-posts and as a well trained, battle-tested selfhost-nerd, I also checked the issue section of github-repros. One was interested as it proposed it would be nice to view the autogenerated caddy config file for debugging purpose. Many answers but nothing concrete and then I read the comment from that guy and he explained in a few sentences, how to look into the caddy log files via docker logs and that one can see the on-the-fly-caddy config file in the logs.</p>\n<p>I thought brillant, exactly what I need what a nice dude that he pointed that out. I looked at the users name (as usual) to make sure I might know him or at least to give him a silent tribute. What should I say, I do not even know that guy, I am the guy!!!</p>\n<p>Looks like I was here around a year ago. I answered that question and left. I never turned back, I even can't remember being on that topic before. Serious, it feels like someone else wrote it. Can't even remember why and how I came there.</p>\n<p>So wonder is this the next level? Should we all be nice and supportive to the community, as you never know whether your older self might appreciate it later? Did this happen to some of you?</p>\n<p>TLTR; I found a valuable answer in a comment to a related issue on a github repro, just to learn it was me, who commented that issue about a year ago and completely forgot about it.</p></div>",

Filebrowser will show the content of the homer-config-pvc (the Homer folder that contains its config saved in a volume)</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Now we just need to add a service so we can reach file browser:</p>\n<pre><code>apiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n  namespace: dashboard\n  name: browser-service\nspec:\n  ports:\n    - name: http\n      port: 80\n      protocol: TCP\n      targetPort: 80\n  selector:\n    app: homer\n</code></pre>\n<p>Once this is done we can port-forward that service to our local machine:</p>\n<pre><code>kubectl port-forward -n dashboard svc/browser-service 8082:80\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here I chose 8082 so filebrowser will be available at <a href=\"http://localhost:8082\">http://localhost:8082</a> (user: admin, pass: admin)</p>\n<p>Once logged in you will see the following (in white cause I changed here to dark mode)</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ennsl6k7xvl71.png?width=1205&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f39e4b45f754b4b7d741f1f2c7e22dcd564ce08\">File browser showing homer config directory</a></p>\n<p>From this point onward you can do pretty much what you want here, add files, remove, edit etc which makes Homer much more easy to configure (I mean you could also have an NFS volume directly attached to the pod and edit from there but I like to have those separated and only do backup to the NAS to each their own)</p>\n<p>Hope this can help someone out there !</p></div>",

My current one is a Dell Precision T5610 (2x Xeon E5-2620 v2) which is great in every way except for SATA3 ports. In order to accommodate my data drives I picked up a cheapish PCI-E 4-port SATA controller, created a couple zfs pools (2 separate mirrors) and it had been running great for months.</p>\n<p>Then one morning I launch Miniflutt (my Miniflux app of choice) and my connection times out. I ssh into the server and it's still up, but upon further inspection, none of my data drives connected to the PCI-E controller are showing. I check that it's in the PCI-E slot firmly and try a couple other things but the SATA controller appears to be dead.</p>\n<p>Fast forward a couple days and a new, hopefully better quality, SATA controller arrives. I plug in the drives and boot up, and one of my pools has already been restored. The other has an SSD for bonus caching and its mount point wasn't empty (I assumed some cached files remained since the SSD is plugged into the motherboard). So I move the files in the mount point, re-import the pool, and bam we're back in business with no data loss.</p>\n<p>So I just wanted to give a shoutout to zfs for how easy it makes dealing with RAID drives. It has simple commands that are easy to remember, takes care of changing device paths automatically, and makes migrating to new machines trivial. I also don't have any friends that are nerdy enough in real life to talk about these things with, so I appreciate all you internet strangers who get me.</p></div>",

Recently I have been losing data because of crashes that just completely ruin Docker's setup. Each time this happens I scramble to figure out how to get my data back, taking far too many hours. I do have a backup solution but there is always some sort of server/Docker setup that needs to be discovered and worked through.</p>\n<p>Now, I'm  a uni student. My weeks and weekends are sporadic and always full. If my server goes down I can't just wait to get off at 5 and fix it that afternoon. It'll be down for a week or more as I find ways to get around my own services just to use basic things like my calendar (which I rely on very much).</p>\n<p>I'm still interested in self hosting and I'm glad I learned the things I learned, but it is becoming too much.</p></div>",

While this is cool/fine for our purposes, I've been wanting to scratch this itch of taking us off of discord and onto something self-hosted. I'd like to have a chat app that is just for the local network, or at least p2p and can communicate over lan. It should also preferably have markdown &amp; image/link embeds. As a bonus, it would be nice to have a way to sync up to the chat while away from home, but I figure I could always set up a VPN to let them tunnel into the home network if that's not natively supported.</p>\n<p>I've looked at a few options, like self-hosting a matrix/IRC server, but I'm not sure what is best. Any suggestions?  </p>\n<p>EDIT: There are a lot of suggestions, but I'd like to know the pros/cons of each. I should also mention that this is primarily for text chat; since we're in close proximity (roommates) we can just knock on each others' doors if we need something haha. Or if people are out and about we can just call over the phone like normal people do.</p></div>",

With the advice of other lovely folk scattered about these forums, I've now settled on a, better, workflow and feel the need to share.</p>\n<p>Hopefully it'll help someone else in the same boat.</p>\n<p>I've been using <a href=\"https://swiftscan.app/\">SwiftScan</a> for years (back when it had a different name) as it allowed me to \"scan\" my documents and mail from my phone, OCR them, then upload straight into Nexcloud.  Done.   But I lost the ability to use the OCR functionality as I was unable to activate my purchases Pro features without a Google Play account.</p>\n<p>I've since found a better workflow;  In <em>reverse</em> order...</p>\n<h1>Management</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/jonaswinkler/paperless-ng\">Paperless-ng</a> is fan-bloody-tastic!  I'm using the LinuxServer.io docker image and it's working a treat.  All my new scans are dumped in here for better-than-I'm-used-to OCR goodness.  I can tag my documents instead of battling with folders in Nextcloud.</p>\n<p><em>Top tip:  put any custom config variables (such as custom file naming) in the docker-compose file under \"environment\".</em></p>\n<h1>PDF cleaning</h1>\n<p>But, I've since found out that my <em>existing</em> OCR'd PDFs have a janked-up OCR layer that Paperless-ng does NOT like - the text content is saved in a single column of characters.  Not Paperless-ng's fault, just something to do with the way SwiftScan has saved the files.</p>\n<p>So, after a LOT of hunting, I've eventually settled on <a href=\"https://www.pdfshaper.com/\">PDF Shaper Free for Windows</a>.  The free version still allows exporting <em>all</em> images from a PDF.  Then I convert all those images back into a fresh, clean PDF (no dirty OCR).  This gets dumped in Paperless-ng and job's a good'un.</p>\n<p><em>Top tip:  experiment with the DPI setting for image exports to get the size/quality you want, as the DPI can be ignored in the import process.</em></p>\n<h1>Scanning</h1>\n<p>I can still scan using SwiftScan, but I've gone back to a dedicated document scanner as without the Pro functionality, the results are a little... primitive.</p>\n<p>I've had an old all-in-one HP USB printer/scanner hooked up to a Raspberry Pi for a few years running CUPS.  Network printing has been great via this method.  But the scanner portion has sat unused ever since.  Until, now....  WHY DID NOBODY TELL ME ABOUT <a href=\"https://github.com/sbs20/scanservjs\">SCANSERV-JS</a>?!  My word this is incredible! It does for scanning what CUPS does for printing, and with a beautiful Web UI.</p>\n<p>I slapped the single-line installer into the Pi, closed my eyes, crossed my fingers, then came back after a cup of tea.  I'm now getting decent scans (the phone scans were working OK, but I'd forgotten how much better a dedicated scanner is) with all the options I'd expect and can download the file to drop in Paperless-ng.  It even does OCR (which I've not tested) if you want to forget Paperless-ng entirely.</p>\n<p><strong>Cheers</strong></p>\n<p>I am a very, very happy camper again, with a self-hosted, easy workflow for my scanned documents and mail.</p>\n<p>Thanks to all that have helped me this month.  I hope someone else gets use from the above notes.</p>\n<p><em>ninja-edit:  Corrected Scan</em><strong><em>Server</em></strong> <em>to Scan</em><strong><em>Serv</em></strong>, but the error in the title will now haunt me until the end of days.</p></div>",

Along the way I discovered this sub and got totally hooked on self hosting services at my house, rediscovered my passion for Linux and system building, and even started implementing some of those concepts in my work. After I graduated, I was applying (rather painfully, shout out to /r/RecruitingHell) to many engineering positions in my discipline but also one long-shot which was decidedly a departure from what I studied - it involved designing new computer systems to help do the sort of research I had studied.</p>\n<p>In the technical interviews, it became clear that my experience with programming, containerized systems, and server management were key to them eventually offering me the job. Essentially some tools I designed for my research and posted to GitHub became my ticket to a new type of career.</p>\n<p>Thanks in part to you all, I now get to call myself a software systems engineer! I\u2019m working in a research field I was already interested in, but get paid to play around with designing locally hosted systems. Having a degree and background in the field were important, but 90% of my day-to-day tasks are based on skills I practiced on my own time. Remember that the things you learn here are valuable, and can even help you find a career if that interests you. </p>\n<p>Now one day I may even be able to earn enough money to pay for all this crap you inspired me to buy\u2026</p></div>",

Here are some very-early-stage screenshots:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/a5hhigdwo3h71.png?width=2640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e41b0af7287b2f48957c45d474d654780bdc9137\">dashboard</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/k10clx9cq3h71.png?width=2884&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3046d2400478c835b4ef15364c1befe6fcc1c46\">settings</a></p>\n<p>The app takes care of deploying changes to zeek. Logs are being parsed and aggregated with fluentbit where they being persisted to an InfluxDB database and queried by Ruby back.</p>\n<p>The roadmap for v1 is 99,9% setup validation and stability. I am planning to add some integrations (telegram, slack etc.) but also apply some basic machine learning theory to predict malicious activities. I am also planning to integrate an offensive scanner I've been working on for a long time, based on nmap and other tools, so the user will be able to gather more information for attackers and intruders.</p>\n<p>I will be releasing this as open source publicly in github as soon as I am sure most of the things work fine. I was hoping to monetize this project but... that's another story.</p>\n<p>I am looking forward to any feedback, questions or feature requests.  </p>\n<p>EDIT: Just created a community /r/paqetz</p></div>",

If you're unfamiliar, Netmaker is a VPN platform built for kernel WireGuard (because of this it can run \\~50%+ faster than many similar platforms). It manages an arbitrary number of virtual networks with advanced features like private DNS, ingress, and egress gateways.</p>\n<p><strong>Here's the major updates in v0.7:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Multitenancy:</strong> Multiple users can share a single server to run and manage separate WireGuard networks.</li>\n<li><strong>UDP Hole-Punching:</strong> Server maintains a list of UDP ports opened by peers and makes them accessible to WireGuard peers in the network, simplifying NAT-to-NAT</li>\n<li><strong>Kubernetes Manifests</strong>: Meshed WireGuard networks for cluster nodes</li>\n<li><strong>Database:</strong> Shifted from MongoDB to rqlite. Additional database support is now just a single file change, and can support practically any SQL distro or general key-value store.</li>\n<li><strong>Quick Start guide:</strong> <a href=\"https://netmaker.readthedocs.io/en/v0.7.1/quick-start.html\">rebooted for a simplified setup</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you're looking for an extended overview of what Netmaker is all about, you should <a href=\"https://itnext.io/getting-started-with-netmaker-a-wireguard-virtual-networking-platform-3d563fbd87f0\">check out this walkthrough</a>.</p>\n<p>At this point, on the server side, we're about where we want to be with the major changes, and the updates will be more for added stability and security. The one last major feature we'll be adding server-side is <strong>relay server support,</strong> which will be relatively straightforward and handle remaining edge cases where network connectivity can't be achieved directly.</p>\n<p>Moving forward, our work will be more on the client side. At this point, we're just running on Linux. With the release of WireGuard NT last week, we plan on adding Windows support as soon as possible, because that is amazing, and from there branching out into userspace implementations to support MacOS and other operating systems.</p>\n<p>Thanks everyone, we've appreciated all your support in bringing this project to where it is over the past several months.</p></div>",

Thought I would share this github repository that I've been using for a few months now. It's called \"Clipface\" and it was created by a fellow named Hubro. It runs in a docker container and is an amazing replacement to Streamable.</p>\n<p>Streamable has a free tier, but they lower the quality on embed streams and delete the videos after a certain amount of time.</p>\n<p>Clipface can embed your video into things like Discord just like Streamable which make it a great replacement for people trying to share gaming clips with their friends. You can also lock your Clipface from public access and generate a \"public URL\" for each video which generates a token by hashing the file's name and your password (this way you can change your password and instantly make all public URL's usless if you need to).</p>\n<p>I host my Clipface on a VPS I use for hosting websites/web servers since my internet speeds at home are not capable of streaming video up and it works great. Hubro was going to add a number of features including file uploading in browser, but he hasn't updated the repository in 2 months so I was hoping if I could bring some attention to Clipface he may be encouraged to continue development. I currently upload files using Filezilla, but you could probably use Syncthing and just drag the videos to a folder on your LAN and then have them sync to your clips folder on your VPS.</p>\n<p>Here is the GitHub repository: <a href=\"https://github.com/Hubro/clipface\">https://github.com/Hubro/clipface</a></p></div>",

            "content_html": "<p>A few years back, I came upon the concept of DeGoogling and it fascinated me. The idea of not relying on Google (or anyone really) for all of your services and learning tons along the way was a really big appeal for me fresh out of college and at my first job where i finally had access to real income. I bought a pi, A NAS and got to work, which lead me here, r/selfhosted.</p>\n<p>But if you frequent this subreddit, you'll hear the sentiment here and other places: Don't selfhost email, it's not worth it.</p>\n<p>And they have good points. It's not worth the work, it'll never be reliable as gmail, and it's a lot of maintaining for something you probably should never use professionally.</p>\n<p>I imagine like a lot of you here, you take it personally as a challenge. I know I did.</p>\n<p>As my projects grew, the NAS turned into a fullgrown server, the 1 Pi turned to 4 (Well I use 4 at the moment. Honestly, I've lost count how many I own) and I'm fully selfhosted</p>\n<p>... except email. </p>\n<p>I'd work on it for a week, get mad when it didn't work the way I wanted and just scrapped it and worked on something else. </p>\n<p>and today, after years of dabbling with it on and off, i did what i thought was impossible: Self-Hosted Email (with a few nitpick specifics)</p>\n<p>Those nitpicks are as follows:</p>\n<p>No monthly subscription*- So no VPSs, hosted email, etc (The only subscription i pay for is email filtering via MXguarddog at 3$USD a year, i'll give it a pass)</p>\n<p>Low Maintainence- Before you say it, I know. \"Low maintenance Self-hosted email\" is a oxymoronic statement but I spent a lot of time setting up postfix and dovecot manually that I was never really happy with the results until I found some Docker solutions that lets me be more hands off. I understand them just enough to not wnt to deal with them (Anyone whos trying to do the same, i HIGHLY suggest doing it manually at least once to understand how they work and then use something like Mailcow, Mailu, Citadel, etc)</p>\n<p>Low Power- A lot of the solutions I've found are x86 only. I'd use a Pi/ARM solution but the one that i did find (Citadel) i honestly didn't love. Also I like docker too much. I install only containers when I can help it. I have a bunch of old laptops/desktops i could use that'd be up for the job but that'd be overkill for something so simple.</p>\n<p>Isolated- I want it to be a dedicated device. Even if i dockerize it, due to the nature of email, If something goes VERY wrong, i don't want it to touch my system critical services. This must not mingle with my main server in any way.</p>\n<p>So, what did we end up with?</p>\n<p>A 2GB Rock Pi X Model B which runs x86_64 pure debian server. it has its own ssd via USB, no sd card failure here. Docker/Docker-compose running Mailu 1.8. MXGuarddog filters incoming messages and Mailgun relays them outgoing so they're accepted (I use a home Dynamic IP internet. I'll get blacklisted to hell and back without a relay. I had to request my ISP to open port 25 but you can probably get this working on another port if they won't open it.). ddclient handles my DDNS on a separate server. I have an Nginx reverse proxy for the webmail portion (admin is lan only) which again is on another server.</p>\n<p>This will not explain docker, getting a domain, setting up the rock pi/host OS or anything else. This is strictly what i followed for my email setup. This is also not as thorough as i'd like from security standpoint so it's not my final iteration of this yet.</p>\n<p>Also my nitpicks may be different from yours. Maybe you want to use a VPS/VM or full machine but this should work for any x86 docker setup that's up to date.</p>\n<p>Here's all my sources for the biggest places I got stuck as far as email goes:</p>\n<h1>(In bold will be what should be working by the end of this step)</h1>\n<p>https://samhobbs.co.uk/raspberry-pi-email-server (this taught me initially how to setup an email server. It worked but i ended up tearing it all down and starting over. Also it took me forever but i feel this is needed first before you even consider keeping it in the long term. At least if i need to troubleshoot my setup, I know how to approach it, somewhat.) Don't try to do this all in one sitting, you'll hate yourself. Do it bits at a time, really understand what's being done and why and complete it at your own pace and then.. </p>\n<h1>You'll have an email server! Sorta. You can fix it up from here but I rather not maintain it so I wiped my OS, started fresh, installed docker and moved on.</h1>\n<p>https://mailu.io/master/compose/setup.html (this takes you through the mailu setup. I used the setup configurator (https://setup.mailu.io/1_7/) for 1_7 and changed it to 1.8 in the docker compose file).  </p>\n<h1>At this point you should have a working mailu installation accessible via lan. You should also be able to connect to it via an email client such as thunderbird, even if you can't send/receive email yet. Since im using a reverse proxy, i chose mail option for TLS in the config so i have SSL for email but not for web access. Your needs may vary here but that's where i got into trouble in my setup. if you don't know what you need, use the letsencrypt option. we're going to use mxguarddog for filtering so antispam and antivirus are optional as clamav will eat up more resources than than anything else but I'm paranoid.</h1>\n<p>https://reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/cw8w7p/dealing_with_selfhosted_email_a_nononsense_guide/ (This helped me with the setup for email filtering and relays. I didnt end up going with sendgrid and went with Mailgun instead. same basic idea though) </p>\n<h1>By the end of this, you should be able to receive email both via thunderbird/webmail, but not send yet.</h1>\n<p>https://documentation.mailgun.com/en/latest/quickstart-sending.html#add-receiving-mx-records (mailgun setup for verifying your domain. ignore the SMTP portion for that. we're using a smart relay) </p>\n<h1>At this point you should be able to send emails but not via Mailu. I used thunderbird to connect to my server and changed the SMTP settings to send email via Mailgun and not Mailu. We'll set that up next.</h1>\n<p>https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/387 (At this point, i could receive but not send email. the last great issue i ran into was the smart relay. the scripts from Orkhan Alikhanov and peterwilli particularly helped here. i was running into an auth problem with 1.7 but switching to 1.8 resolved it) </p>\n<h1>And this is where i called it quits. Emails should be working in both directions at this point from both Mailu and third party clients. The only thing i didnt confirm is if SMTP and IMAP work from Thunderbird outside of the LAN but I think we did the hard part already.</h1>\n<p>below is my nginx reverse proxy config for mailu. If you want Admin to be web accessible, uncomment out the block</p>\n<pre><code>server {\n  listen 443 ssl;\n  listen [::]:443 ssl;\n\n  server_name your.sub.domain;\n\n  ssl_certificate /your/cert.pem;\n  ssl_certificate_key /your/key.pem;\n\n  client_max_body_size 0;\n\n  location /webmail {\n  proxy_pass https://yourserver/webmail;\n  }\n\n# location /admin {\n#    proxy_pass http://yourserver/admin;\n#    proxy_set_header Host $http_host;\n#  proxy_redirect https://yourserver https://your.sub.domain; \n# }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I'm SURE my setup isn't perfect but It's good enough for me to look back on and say \"Yeah, I did that\" even if it did take a lot of internet strangers along the way to help. This is sort of my way of giving back to r/selfhosted. I'm by means no expert but i'll try to help out where I can. Also any suggestions for improvement or something I missed would be great.</p>\n<p>Good luck to anyone who wants to give this a shot. I hope you can feel as proud as I did when I got it working myself. I'm rooting for you too. :)</p>\n<p>EDIT:</p>\n<p>Things I'm planning on adding when I can as I think of them:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Fix IMAP/SMTP SSL off Lan</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Rejecting all emails that's not from MXGuarddog (Firewall router blocks all requests to my open ports that are not on from their IPs)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

It\u2019s been over a week since I asked for a refund and their SLA is 1 day. Return window is only 14 days</p>\n<p>They didn\u2019t address my bug questions either.</p>\n<p>Now I\u2019m having to dispute through my card issuer.</p>\n<p>You\u2019re better off buying a well reviewed invoicing software from Code Canyon or maybe a different suggestion you can find here</p>",
