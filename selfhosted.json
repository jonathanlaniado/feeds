It is designed to be easy to set up and maintain, secure, and reliable.</p>\n<p>UHS is designed out of the box to use SSL and nginx as a reverse proxy.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Services are enabled/disabled and configured with YAML, which can be created interactively with the <a href=\"https://github.com/TechSquidTV/uhs-cli\">UHS-CLI</a>. The `uhs` cli was create to easily configure the services you want to enable in UHS. From a development standpoint, it also functions as a \"schema\" for the UHS templates. You can see a screencast of the CLI here: <a href=\"https://asciinema.org/a/T0Cz23OthKROiZi0FV2v5wfe2\">https://asciinema.org/a/T0Cz23OthKROiZi0FV2v5wfe2</a></p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>I've been running the setup for about a month now and working on getting the repos ready to share over the last two weeks especially. The included services so far are very much my own favorites but I am very open to requests and collaboration so please get in contact or open an issue if you'd like to contribute.</p></div>",

I know I missed last month's update. Work has been busy, and so has the Immich team. We have been brewing some big features over the last two months, and I want to finish everything before making the progress update post. </p>\n<p>So here are a few things that have been added to Immich recently. I hope you like those features as much as we do!</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Facial Recognition</li>\n<li>Partner Sharing</li>\n<li>Global Map View</li>\n<li>Responsive Web Interface</li>\n<li>Archiving</li>\n<li>Searchable description</li>\n<li>Managing login sessions</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>FACIAL RECOGNITION</h1>\n<p>Immich can now detect faces and group (cluster) similar faces together. You can view all the photos/videos that contain the person by clicking on the person, and you can search the assets with the person after naming them.</p>\n<p>This is our first iteration of the feature, so expect enhancement and additional actions (merge, hide, favorite faces) that come with this in future releases.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/euss0gtwrn0b1.png?width=2736&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=be3046ab1799ad8e17764e3ca567b57797af7c9c\">Curated people</a></p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/j76d3qxxrn0b1.png?width=2755&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=6b8cbfd262e49efe9bc1ef69cd0323cc15173959\">Photos with the target person</a></p>\n<h1>PARTNER SHARING</h1>\n<p>This is one of the most requested features we received, and we finally had a chance to integrate it into the application. You can now choose not only one or two but an unlimited number of users in your Immich instance to share your timeline. So you don\u2019t have to use the same account or manually put assets into a shared album.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/i7rnrhw0sn0b1.png?width=1742&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=7559bd3f0ba19da4fcfc5a0682a2792e533f0941\">Select partners</a></p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/mw7egdj1sn0b1.png?width=2723&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=4cfcbe3da5982f153b65628ef5da8a86d7924d15\">Partner's timeline can be accessed on the Sharing page</a></p>\n<h1>GLOBAL MAP VIEW</h1>\n<p>I know we all like to see where we have been over the world and the memory at each location. Immich now has the map view, in which you can see a group of photos/videos taken at those locations.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/ip3x3ju5sn0b1.png?width=2570&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=6684a9015adde7bc73d870422095a0ce9cd1f9f2</p>\n<h1>RESPONSIVE WEB INTERFACE AND WPA</h1>\n<p>The web interface is now usable over the web browser on your mobile phone. Thanks to all the contributors for helping make the web app responsive on the web.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/b82j1ou7sn0b1.png?width=641&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=fb36c1fe8940c74a7b91e494a05fce766eb213ff</p>\n<h1>ARCHIVING</h1>\n<p>You can now hide photos or videos you don\u2019t want to appear on the timeline to keep things tidy and safe for everyone. They will be available in the Archive section of the app.</p>\n<h1>SEARCHABLE DESCRIPTION</h1>\n<p>Even though Immich doesn\u2019t have an official custom tag system, you can now use the description as a dropped-in replacement for that. It can be fuzzy-search as well using the search functionality \ud83d\ude42</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/fx61tl99sn0b1.png?width=1035&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=7465a134161155010e1347dfc39b411d06a7cbae</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/lfr996q9sn0b1.png?width=1033&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=1e125eb3206f9a05e9edb86858920be4b69e630c</p>\n<h1>MANAGING LOGIN SESSION</h1>\n<p>We provide the functionality to view and manage all devices that use your user account to log in. So you can log them out for any suspicious device.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/pxa4m2dbsn0b1.png?width=1638&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=8c1efd7ff9cbfdbc8bd056a0d41902998b21bc73\">All logged-in sessions are shown.</a></p>\n<p>Finally, we keep fixing bugs, improving the server and clients, optimizing the performance, and solving technical debt as we are inching forward to a stable release milestone.</p>\n<p>I want to personally thank all the contributors and the users for helping make this release possible by providing feedback, support, testing, and development to the application. </p>\n<p>As always, thank you for using Immich, and I hope you enjoy this update.</p>\n<p>Remember to support the project!</p>\n<p>If you find the project helpful and it helps you in some ways, you can support the project\u00a0<a href=\"https://github.com/sponsors/alextran1502?frequency=one-time&amp;sponsor=alextran1502\">one time</a>\u00a0or\u00a0<a href=\"https://github.com/sponsors/alextran1502\">monthly</a>\u00a0from GitHub Sponsors.</p>\n<p>Join our friendly\u00a0<a href=\"https://discord.gg/D8JsnBEuKb\">Discord</a> for discussion and to get help!</p>\n<p>\ud83c\udf89 Cheer! \ud83c\udf89</p>\n<p>Alex</p></div>",

You need either your own domain or a <a href=\"https://tailscale.com/kb/1154/free-plans-discounts/\">GitHub Organization</a>. Sorry. We will fix this, but not today. Meanwhile, don\u2019t forget that you can use <a href=\"https://tailscale.com/kb/1084/sharing/\">Node Sharing</a> to share devices (including <a href=\"https://tailscale.com/kb/1103/exit-nodes/\">Exit Nodes</a>) across individual tailnets. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Has anybody tested this? Do I need to create a new account?  Can I migrate existing one with all the nodes? This sounds nice but is confusing.</p>\n<p>100 nodes. THAT is big one. I was using tailscale to do monitoring and because I had to be aconomical about my nodes I had to run tailscale containers in host mode. This change allows me to isolate them and let one TS docker container be accusable only  Prometheus or Influx DB and exporters. This is good for security and avoiding networking conflicts.</p>\n<p>No more subnet route limit. This one is a little bit more advanced but this is the one I am really exited about. Basically if you have a router that has tailscale installed and give that node an option to assign private IPs form that subnet... you will be able to access your router internal IPs just like you were at home. Very handy. </p>\n<p>All of this is awesome and I appreciate their transparency... though the post is TL;DR... still it's nice.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://tailscale.com/blog/pricing-v3/\">https://tailscale.com/blog/pricing-v3/</a></p>\n<p><strong>What about others?</strong></p>\n<p>Their closest alt is <a href=\"https://www.zerotier.com/\">https://www.zerotier.com/</a> with 25 nodes 1 user and unlimited subnets... I think... have not ran into a limit. They were ahead on what they allow before this change. <br />\nZT has one more problem... or had... stability. Using them I experienced that some (especially mobile) clients were crashing out after long term operation. There was a recent update that seamed to fix it.</p>\n<p>However Zerotier has 2 major advantages for selfhosting or why I prefer it (this is subjective understanding from reading docs and limited testing): <br />\na) P2P. There is no need for central node... ish... As long as network topology does not change there is no need to contact to routing server. <br />\nb) If your headscale server (tailscale self-hostable ) goes down your network goes down. With ZT you get get global routing servers as backups Also clients work flawlessly with selfhosted ZT. For example for Windows you need to edit registries to use headsclae server .</p></div>",

Unless you have a whole DevOps team, it usually brings more problems than benefits, and unnecessary infrastructure bills buried a lot of startups before they got anywhere.</p>\n<p>As for prerequisites, you can't be a complete beginner in the world of computers. If you've never even heard of Docker, if you don't know at least something about DNS, or if you don't have any experience with Linux, this course is probably not for you. That being said, I do explain the basics too, but probably not in enough detail for a complete beginner.</p>\n<p>Here's a 100% OFF coupon if you want to check it out:</p>\n<p>~~https://www.udemy.com/course/real-world-devops-project-from-start-to-finish/?couponCode=FREEDEVOPS2304FEEQK~~</p>\n<p>Edit: all gone!</p>\n<p>Be sure to BUY the course for $0, and not sign up for Udemy's subscription plan. The Subscription plan is selected by default, but you want the BUY checkbox. If you see a price other than $0, chances are that all coupons have been used already.\nYou can try manually entering the coupon code because Udemy sometimes messes with the link.</p>\n<p>The accompanying files for the course are at https://github.com/predmijat/realworlddevopscourse</p>\n<p>I encourage you to watch \"free preview\" videos to get the sense of what will be covered, but here's the gist:</p>\n<p>The goal of the course is to create an easily deployable and reproducible server which will have \"everything\" a startup or a small company will need - VPN, mail, Git, CI/CD, messaging, hosting websites and services, sharing files, calendar, etc. It can also be useful to individuals who want to self-host all of those - I ditched Google 99.9% and other than that being a good feeling, I'm not worried that some AI bug will lock my account with no one to talk to about resolving the issue.</p>\n<p>Considering that it covers a wide variety of topics, it doesn't go in depth in any of those. Think of it as going down a highway towards the end destination, but on the way there I show you all the junctions where I think it's useful to do more research on the subject.</p>\n<p>We'll deploy services inside Docker and LXC (Linux Containers). Those will include a mail server (iRedMail), Zulip (Slack and Microsoft Teams alternative), GitLab (with GitLab Runner and CI/CD), Nextcloud (file sharing, calendar, contacts, etc.), checkmk (monitoring solution), Pi-hole (ad blocking on DNS level), Traefik with Docker and file providers (a single HTTP/S entry point with automatic routing and TLS certificates).</p>\n<p>We'll set up WireGuard, a modern and fast VPN solution for secure access to VPS' internal network, and I'll also show you how to get a wildcard TLS certificate with certbot and DNS provider.</p>\n<p>To wrap it all up, we'll write a simple Python application that will compare a list of the desired backups with the list of finished backups, and send a result to a Zulip stream. We'll write the application, do a 'git push' to GitLab which will trigger a CI/CD pipeline that will build a Docker image, push it to a private registry, and then, with the help of the GitLab runner, run it on the VPS and post a result to a Zulip stream with a webhook.</p>\n<p>When done, you'll be equipped to add additional services suited for your needs.</p>\n<p>If this doesn't appeal to you, please leave the coupon for the next guy :)</p>\n<p>I hope that you'll find it useful!</p>\n<p>Happy learning,\nPredrag</p></div>",

Alex here! Look like spring is finally come, and I am back with Immich\u2019s monthly update to deliver some good news.</p>\n<p><strong>Revamped search experience</strong></p>\n<p>Since the last announcement of moving the machine learning service to Python, we\u2019ve revamped the search mechanism completely so you can search among hundred of thousand of photos quickly and accurately using natural language as the search term. So you can search for \u201clazy cat in the box\u201d or \u201cbaby wearing a yellow skirt and sitting under the sun.\u201d We can achieve this thanks to the pre-trained Open AI\u2019s CLIP model and the integration with Typesense (a self-hosted and open-source search engine). The accuracy of the search will blow you away. Typesense will also be used for our future facial search and grouping mechanism.</p>\n<p>Here are a few sample results:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/omcbagrmdqqa1.png?width=1249&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b6ed9cc4961ef19b8b5003d5f6a7f30dec821cae\">Search for \u201cred mushroom\u201d</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/yflswe4odqqa1.png?width=1243&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=fd63b9fc17ec08b1850a1757ebdb3e2f5ee41468\">Search for \u201cbird on the water\u201d</a></p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>We\u2019ve added the explore page to show the curated detected objects and locations and some selected categories so you can navigate to those searches quickly.</p>\n<p><strong>Offline mode</strong></p>\n<p>Previously, when the server was down or your phone didn't have an internet connection, tapping anything in the mobile app would send you back to the login screen. This is because the mobile app couldn\u2019t retrieve any data from the server. We've added a new feature that allows the mobile app to work offline, so you can still view your photos and videos cached or stored on your device even when the server is down or you don't have an internet connection.</p>\n<p>In addition, when viewing photos and videos residing on your device, these are no longer loaded from the server but directly from the device. This reduces your mobile data usage and increases the loading speed of thumbnails while scrolling the timeline.</p>\n<p>We've also improved a lot of UI/UX elements and optimized data querying on both the web and mobile apps so that you will have a good experience when browsing, searching, and viewing in Immich.</p>\n<p>I want to express my appreciation to all the contributors and the users who have been helping us use and test the application, reporting bugs. Immich is the project for the community and by the community.</p>\n<p>As always, thank you for using Immich, and I hope you enjoy this update.</p>\n<p>Remember to support the project!</p>\n<p>If you find the project helpful and it helps you in some ways, you can support the project\u00a0<a href=\"https://github.com/sponsors/alextran1502?frequency=one-time&amp;sponsor=alextran1502\">one time</a>\u00a0or\u00a0<a href=\"https://github.com/sponsors/alextran1502\">monthly</a>\u00a0from GitHub Sponsors.</p>\n<p>Join our friendly\u00a0<a href=\"https://discord.gg/D8JsnBEuKb\">Discord</a> for discussion and getting help!</p>\n<p>\ud83c\udf89 Cheer! \ud83c\udf89</p>\n<p>Alex</p></div>",

Since releasing it last year, the API has come a long way, squashing a ton of bugs and improving stability.

This release brings a lot of new features and improvements to the app. Here are some of the highlights:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>iOS Background Uploads</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Machine Learning moved to Python-based Image</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Auto-link Live Photos</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>iOS Background Uploads</h2>\n<p>I want to thank @martyfuhry for diving into this feature and his wife for wanting the feature :P.</p>\n<p>iOS users can now upload photos and videos in the background. This means that you can take photos and videos, which will be uploaded to your server without opening the app. The background mechanism from the iPhone has two modes, a shorter task which runs around every 10 minutes and lasts for about 30 seconds, and a longer task which runs every 30-45 minutes and lasts longer. From our extensive testing, the app can upload about 1000 pictures overnight without plugging in and on WIFI.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/5n363ohvmmja1.png?width=1170&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ac90210fa4129dc7136197d6bda1cd136f780a34</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>You can get notified when the background task is running by enabling the notification setting from the Settings menu on Immich mobile app.</p>\n<p>We are looking for feedback and bug reports on this feature. Please let us know if you have any issues with it.</p>\n<h2>Machine Learning moved to Python-based Image</h2>\n<p>We are planning to revamp our search capability. The first step to making it smarter is to move our machine learning project from NodeJs based to Python based. This will allow us to use more powerful machine-learning libraries and improve the search.</p>\n<p>We are planning to add facial recognition in the near future and also use <a href=\"https://www.sbert.net/examples/applications/image-search/README.html\">SBERT</a> for image search. This will allow you to search for images based on the content of the image.</p>\n<h2>Auto-link Live Photos</h2>\n<p>LivePhotos\u2019 motion and still parts are now automatically linked together. This means that you can upload two separate files from the web interface or from the CLI, and they will be linked into one LivePhoto asset and displayed correctly on the timeline.</p>\n<p>For previously uploaded motion and picture parts of the LivePhoto asset from the web or the CLI, you can re-run the metadata extraction job to link them together.</p>\n<p>And like other releases, we have made many other improvements and bug fixes for better performance and UI consistency across platforms. Please take a look at the full changelog below.</p>\n<p>As always, thank you for using Immich, and I hope you enjoy this release.</p>\n<p>Remember to support the project!</p>\n<p>\ud83c\udf89 Cheer! \ud83c\udf89</p>\n<h2>Support</h2>\n<p>If you find the project helpful and it helps you in some ways, you can support the project <a href=\"https://github.com/sponsors/alextran1502?frequency=one-time&amp;sponsor=alextran1502\">one time</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/sponsors/alextran1502\">monthly</a> from GitHub Sponsors</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Join our friendly <a href=\"https://discord.gg/D8JsnBEuKb\">Discord</a> for discussion and getting help!</p></div>",

We\u2019re a team of friends that have been working on Lodestone for around 8 months. We feel like the project is feature-complete enough for a beta release, and are hoping to get some feedback! You can check out our project page <a href=\"https://github.com/Lodestone-Team/lodestone\">here</a>. We also have a <a href=\"https://discord.gg/PkHXRQXkf6\">Discord</a>! Feel free to join and chat around.</p>\n<p>Lodestone is an all-in-one self-hosted Minecraft server management tool (some call it \"server wrapper\" or \"server panel\"). We have planned support for other games in the future, such as Risk of Rain and Terraria.</p>\n<p>We are releasing the backend (we\u2019re calling it \u201cLodestone Core\u201d) that is written in Rust, a desktop client written with React + TS + Tauri, and a <a href=\"https://lodestone.cc\">web app</a>. All open source + free!</p>\n<p>The #1 goal of Lodestone is to make self-hosting game servers on any platform a streamlined and simple process. Lodestone is built with a focus on the user experience to minimize the friction of setting up a server. Part of this effort is an intuitive and straightforward UI we have developed over 4 months. Lodestone also has some advanced features on the table for expert users, such as an event viewer, multiple users + permissions, and an upcoming plugin system.</p>\n<p>Here are some of the features currently implemented</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Automatic one-click setup for Minecraft servers (We manage Java for you!)</li>\n<li>Real-time updates and notifications on server statuses</li>\n<li>Adjust your server settings in UI instead of messing around in config files</li>\n<li>Create multiple user accounts with scoped permissions for a collaborative server management experience</li>\n<li>File explorers for each game server</li>\n<li>Virtual consoles for each game server's CLI</li>\n<li>Open ports through UPnP</li>\n<li>Server monitoring (RAM &amp; CPU usage)</li>\n<li>Full support for Windows, partial support for Linux, with upcoming MacOS support*</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Lodestone Core is supported on Windows, Linux, and MacOS. The desktop client on Linux and MacOS needs more work</em></p>\n<p>We also have planned some exciting features, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A plugin system that can listen and react to server events</li>\n<li>Securely expose your server to the internet without port forwarding</li>\n<li>An event viewer for a granular view of everything in your server logs</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is by far the biggest project we have worked on, and rough patches are expected since it is still in its early (but rapid!) development phase. Please give it a try if you are interested. And of course, bug reports/suggestions are welcome!</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/7tyhsp5p5efa1.png?width=1467&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=620e80d7e1e804101e0d202f7317cc7a0c18ca4b\">Lodestone Dashboard</a></p></div>",

However, I've been facing issues with it and I'd like to share them because these issues wasted enough of my time, and this is the ethos of this sub. Maybe I'm wrong; make what you will out of this :-)</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The straw that broke that back - The introduced paid subscription for self-hosted users (money isn't the problem, really)</strong>: After having introduced their \"paid subscription\" for the self-hosted plan (yes, you heard that right, you have to pay for self-hosted now, and it won't work anymore without a key, so you're locked out), it's become impossible to rely on the software. They were nice enough to offer me a \"free key\", which they offer for free to those who had been using the software before they introduced self-hosted subscription (or if you write them an unbiased review, as per their words)... well, good luck getting it. Because their email server is listed as spam by many spam lists services for some reason, I simply couldn't receive that email after more than a week... and hence...</li>\n<li><strong>Your notes are not yours anymore</strong>: Since they introduced the subscription, this made me realize how little control I have over my notes. You have no control over your notes almost at all. Because I failed in activating my notes software, I failed to have any control over my notes for over a week. All their \"special note types\", like checklists (which are a given in markdown-based note-taking) stopped working (even though I'm hosting the extensions myself on my server). I can't fix typos. I can't update any notes. Everything fell apart! I can't take formatted notes anymore. Basically my notes are not mine, even though I'm hosting them, because the software that opens them is not free. It's licensed and I need to have the proper license to use it (or rebuild the code myself and remove that), which brings me to the next point</li>\n<li><strong>Proprietary solutions for everything</strong>: For some reason everything in Standard Notes is proprietary yet open-source at the same time. All solutions are reinventions of the same solutions to problems that have been already solved. Your note-taking software is basically a plain-text-editor. Then, anything more you need to do is a proprietary add-on. You wanna make a checklist? Proprietary extension. You wanna have some code highlighting? Proprietary. You wanna use markdown? Proprietary. Take a look at their \"Super notes\". They look like wonderful markdown notes! But it's all proprietary nonsensical json underneath that doesn't work anywhere else. You type markdown, but it's saved as json. You can't even change the pre-formatted code-block types natively because... it's not really markdown. You can't export your notes because they're not markdown (except one by one by hand in the app, which offers markdown format), and if you can export them, they won't work out of the box, because everything is proprietary, so you have to write your own json parser (which doesn't exist out there as of the time of writing this for Super Notes). <strong>You want to upload files?</strong> File uploads work with proprietary solutions, either with FileSafe (which you need a separate WebDAV server for, just for the files, in addition to everything else) or their own internal (new) file upload system, which isn't inherently compatible with anything related to the notes, so it's totally separate. Even worse, because of the bad design around all this, even if you have notes that are \"protected\" (need password for access, hence highly secret), that protection doesn't really apply to the files attached to the note, and you can see the files in a separate list! Everything is proprietary and once anything goes out of the plan (subscription problem, etc), everything breaks, and all your work stops, no more note-taking, or even edits.</li>\n<li><strong>The self-hosted server is complex</strong>: It seems that they adapted the server solution of their users to self-hosted. Basically, the easiest way to think about this is how Bitwarden is to Vaultwarden. Bitwarden is a huge, sophisticated solution that consumes lots of memory and resources because it's built for huge infrastructures. Standard Notes backend is quite the same. It has two SQL databases (which they promised to reduce to one)... it has a caching server, API gateway, file server, web server, authentication, and other things. I think there's more than 10 services running in their docker containers. That's not bad by itself... but it's a huge burden to maintain all that and to get it to work. And then because of this, the maintenance of this huge infrastructure makes the cost of maintaining it bigger, leading to \"needing to fund this\" by making the self-hosted service a paid-subscription... How many of you host notes for more than 500 people to require this amount of scaling? Or even 5 people, to need all this infrastructure? Just like Vaultwarden... a simple executable with a database and authentication is more than enough and is even fast enough. After all, the syncing server is a glorified WebDAV server.</li>\n<li><strong>Bonus: Fragmentation</strong>. While I was suffering and exporting my data from Standard Notes to Joplin, I simply failed to download the only one file I had uploaded with the new files system (that I've been explaining to people how to use). Why? I've got no idea. This is the problem I mentioned before about proprietary solutions combined with server complexity in action. But you see, the notes are separate from files in every way, so you could have notes working for weeks, but then files fail some time earlier for some reason, and you'll never notice until you're in the middle of your work, and you need the data, and you never get it... better stop working and start debugging. Now I have to dig to see what's going on with that thing. Wish me luck. (Update: I failed. Luckily I was able to retrieve that file from a backup).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But does it mean Standard Notes is bad? Absolutely not. It's very nice in its own way, for absolute beginners who don't care about self-hosting (in my opinion), which is why I thought this whole self-hosted subscription is bad. But from all I mentioned above, it has close to zero interoperability or upgradability or compatibility with existing solutions and is fully proprietary in everything it does. I'm prepared to sacrifice the niceties in it to have a piece of mind that I will be able to export my notes to simple markdowns by using something like Joplin... and I'll be able to run a simple server that doesn't use tons of services just to host less users than a single-hand finger-count.</p>\n<p>I'm also sacrificing having encrypted notes locally. I basically split my notes into those that need to be secret, and I used other tools to write them down, and those that need to be flexible, and I'm using Joplin for that.</p>\n<p>And if you're the Standard Notes staff reading this, I'm sorry. I tried really hard to stay. But I can't hand my data control to the whims of your volatile decisions and proprietary solutions, because the value of data is in its accessibility; that's the ethos of self-hosting things. And I'll say that I donated and was happy to donate before the fiasco of locking me out of the software capabilities as if I'm using Microsoft Windows.</p>\n<p>Hope these issues get addresses some day in the future. All the best.</p></div>",

So, I have been working on a whole stack of self-hosted applications that is aiming to achieve some Google Photos functionality with a mobile app.  </p>\n<p>My initial prototype works, it can perform backup images/video on the device and show all images across multiple devices with the same user entity. I have some questions for you guys to understand what functions are needed for a successful self-hosted application.  </p>\n<p>Is Docker Image/Docker Compose a must?  </p>\n<p>What is your thought on distributed storage option for the sake of redundancy? Store all images on the running VM/container is ok but it keeps me awake at night knowing that I can still somehow mess up my setup and the data is gone.  </p>\n<p>Do you need image manipulation features in the app (cropping, rotating, adding filters...etc?)  </p>\n<p>Sharing features, thoughts, and needs?  </p>\n<p>Estimate how many pictures/videos do you guys have? I ask this to consider some optimization and method of retrieving assets way back in the past.  </p>\n<p>Thank you for your time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It has been amazing looking back and seeing the progress of the project. Thank you to you all for the encouragement, criticism, contribution, and support.

So more something like Nextcloud, Rocket.chat, Gitlab.</p>\n<p>For me, i think it was (in alphabetical order) AdGuard Home, Mailcow, Onedev, Paperless, Plausible. They all have their own unique features and benefits. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome\">Adguard</a>: Adguard Home is a self-hosted ad blocker that can be used to block ads and tracking scripts on your home network. It works by acting as a local DNS server, which allows it to intercept and block requests to known ad and tracking servers before they reach your device. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/mailcow/mailcow-dockerized\">Mailcow</a>: Mailcow is a self-hosted mail server that provides a full-featured email solution for small to medium-sized organizations. It includes features such as spam and virus protection, and support for multiple domains. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://code.onedev.io/\">Onedev</a>: Onedev is a self-hosted Git repository management platform that includes features for code review, project management, and continuous integration. It is designed to be lightweight and easy to use.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx\">Paperless</a>: Paperless is a self-hosted document management system that allows you to store, organize, and access your digital documents from anywhere. In 2022 the fork paperless-ngx was released. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/plausible/analytics\">Plausible</a>: Plausible is a self-hosted web analytics platform that provides simple, privacy-friendly tracking for your website. It allows you to see how many people are visiting your site, where they are coming from, and which pages they are viewing.</p>\n<p>What about you? What are your top five self-hosted apps of the year? Were there new ones that you started using in 2022? Share your experiences with them and why you think they stand out from the rest.</p>\n<p>Edit: Forgot AdGuard Home, so swapped it for WordPress.</p></div>",

Please share your feedback and thoughts in this active discussion thread <a href=\"https://github.com/immich-app/immich/discussions/1006\">https://github.com/immich-app/immich/discussions/1006</a></p>\n<p>This Christmas special update includes more customization for the application. Here are some significant features we have added since the last update. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>OIDC Support</li>\n<li>LivePhotos Support</li>\n<li>User-defined Storage Structure</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Application setting and User-defined storage structure</h1>\n<p>We have implemented a setting page for the admin, which can access on the web. This allows the admin to fine-tune the Immich instance and add support for OIDC configuration from here. The latest update includes <strong>the user-defined storage structure template setting.</strong> </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/kxk9oqiovw6a1.png?width=2238&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fec2841807bb0d7419c977cf4be578752936eaa2\">User-defined storage structure</a></p>\n<p>The interactive template builder and popular presets we borrowed from the Lightroom export interface will show you what the final structure would look like.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<h1>LivePhotos</h1>\n<p>iOS LivePhotos is now fully backup from the iPhone. There will be a HEIC and MOV to make up a LivePhotos asset. They are stored together.  When you download an asset from the mobile app, the two will be merged to restore the LivePhoto functionality. When you download from the web, there will be two files: HEIC for the photo part and MOV for the motion part. </p>\n<p>You can view the motion by hovering your mouse cursor on the thumbnail or clicking on the play button in the detail view.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://reddit.com/link/zq2kni/video/8ptz5u2byw6a1/player\">Live Photo Demo</a></p>\n<h1>OIDC Support</h1>\n<p>Yes, OIDC is integrated into Immich, and you can enable the mechanism from the web interface. On the mobile app, after inputting the server address, it will query for the OIDC feature, and if enabled, it will automatically add the log-in button with OIDC.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://reddit.com/link/zq2kni/video/81pozky0zw6a1/player\">OIDC on the mobile app</a></p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<h1>Thank you</h1>\n<p>Thank you to all the contributors and the users who are helping us by using, testing, and updating the application daily.

Today, we'll make the first of such updates - happy to hear feedback if there are more things you'd like to hear more / less about.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><strong>THE UPDATES</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>250x performance improvement:</strong> With our latest release of Medusa, we just made a huge breakthrough with a &gt;250x performance improvement. This is obviously significant, and we will publish a comprehensive deep-dive on it soon. For now, you can enjoy a much faster application.</li>\n<li><strong>React Admin:</strong> We likewise <strong>migrated our Admin Dashboard to use React + Vite,</strong> giving you a lot more flexibility but also meaning the Gatsby version is officially deprecated.</li>\n<li><strong>B2B Ecommerce:</strong> At last, we also prepared <strong>Medusa to</strong> <strong>handle B2B ecommerce</strong> with our newest releases of Sales Channels, Customer Groups, and Price List, which allow you to create differentiated views, pricing, and promotions for B2B customers. Read more <a href=\"https://medusajs.com/blog/medusa-b2b-part-1/\">here</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><strong>WHAT IS MEDUSA?</strong></p>\n<p>For those of you new to Medusa, the short story is that we are self-hosted (surprise ;-)) / open source alternative to the likes of Shopify, Commercetools and similar.</p>\n<p>We try to approach the ecommerce space with a more modern developer-first approach than the traditional OS players (read: Magento, Woo, Prestashop etc.). We are building a node.js based solution that is meant to be composable and flexible for developers to scale with rather than an all-in-one encompassing solution.</p>\n<p>We have existed since the Summer last year and currently have a community of +4,000 developers. Our engine is powering ecommerce setups across the globe and we know engineering teams from small 1-person startups to public companies that are building with Medusa - i.e. no project is too big or too small, although you obviously need to be a dev to handle a tool like this.</p></div>",

We have been working on it for more than a year together with u/farukaydin and started to get early adopters. Now it's time to announce it to more prominent communities.</p>\n<p>In case you don't know what Zapier is, it is a product that allows end users to integrate the web applications they use and automate workflows.</p>\n<p>If you want to check it out directly, you can use the following links:</p>\n<p>Website: <a href=\"http://automatisch.io/\">automatisch.io</a><br />\nDocs: <a href=\"http://automatisch.io/docs\">automatisch.io/docs</a><br />\nGitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/automatisch/automatisch\">https://github.com/automatisch/automatisch</a></p>\n<p>If you want to check out the screenshots of the product:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/aarxXSD.png\">Apps</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/mE79TRL.png\">Flows</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/d2HOP6u.png\">Editor</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/weLWlxn.png\">Executions</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/pzrpckO.png\">Execution details</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are existing solutions like Zapier or Make in the market, but we still wanted to build Automatisch as an open-source alternative because you can keep your data on your own servers with Automatisch. It's a critical requirement for companies with private user data that can't be shared with any other external service, like most of the health or financial sector companies. European companies also have similar concerns with the current GDPR law with products hosted in the US.</p>\n<p>You can check the available integrations <a href=\"https://automatisch.io/docs/guide/available-apps\">here</a>. We currently have limited integrations, but we are working on adding more and improving the existing ones.</p>\n<p>Please give it a try and let us know if you have any feedback, and if you like what we are doing with Automatisch, please give us a star on GitHub.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Edit: We have incorporated a brief description of Zapier in the post above.</p></div>",

Alex here, and I am back with another quick update on the progress of Immich. </p>\n<p>The last month has been very eventful for Immich in terms of solving long-term issues, fixing bugs, and adding more features. We are coming close to a state where significant changes to the application's architecture will happen less frequently.</p>\n<p>You can access the repository <a href=\"https://github.com/immich-app/immich\">here</a> </p>\n<h1>Dark mode for the web \ud83c\udf89</h1>\n<p>We have adopted the dark color scheme of the mobile app to the web. So hopefully, this feature comes in time with the winter to keep your eyes cozy in the dark.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/srcg7i4chjz91.png?width=5108&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16543fc9b1be4209b2ad213b1a77c78466e11fa7\">Web dark mode</a></p>\n<h1>Show local photos and videos in the app \ud83c\udf89</h1>\n<p>We have implemented the mechanism to show local photos and videos in the mobile app. This feature is a preparation step to make the app work offline. This mechanism is similar to how the \"App-Which-Must-Not-Be-Named\" is currently doing. You can read more about the feature <a href=\"https://github.com/immich-app/immich/releases/tag/v1.35.0_54-dev\">here</a></p>\n<p>Along with this feature is improving the initial loading speed on the mobile app by using a caching mechanism.</p>\n<h1>New website and documentation site \ud83c\udf89</h1>\n<p>After using GitHub's Readme as the primary documentation place for so long, and as more and more features/mechanisms are built. So, we have officially implemented a documentation site so that we have a nice and clean way to present our ideas to new users and contributors.</p>\n<p>You can access the site from here <a href=\"https://immich.app/docs/overview/introduction\">https://immich.app/docs/overview/introduction</a></p>\n<h1>Other notable changes</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>The admin user can now delete a user. The user can be recovered by the admin user within 7-day. This mechanism is very powerful and sensitive, so please be responsible for your user's precious memories.</li>\n<li>The album can now be downloaded from the web interface as a zip file(s).</li>\n<li>Duplicated assets on the mobile app are now detected, and they will stay in a separate list which will not be uploaded the next time.</li>\n<li>Server statistic is available on the Admin page on the web.</li>\n<li>Bulk-selected photos and videos can be added directly to the album from the main timeline on both the web and the mobile app.</li>\n<li>All endpoints are configurable through the environment variable to those who don't use Docker as the deployment method.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/r1bwmc2hhjz91.png?width=2556&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3faa7307045d09fce4d1e65fce810a84b4fabe48\">Server Statistic</a></p>\n<h1>What is brewing? \ud83c\udf7b</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>The OIDC feature is currently in the final review stage and will be merged soon (<a href=\"https://github.com/immich-app/immich/pull/884\">PR Link</a>). </li>\n<li>Live Photo support is being worked on, thanks to the recent updates of the library that we use to handle the asset on the mobile app. We can now back up two parts of the Live Photo (image and motion) and merge both backs into the original files. Thus preserving the Live Photo asset functionality on iOS (<a href=\"https://github.com/immich-app/immich/pull/950\">PR Link</a>).</li>\n<li>The Custom configuration interface is in the final review state. This mechanism will open up additional ways of managing the application for the admin user in a more convenient and non-intrusive way (<a href=\"https://github.com/immich-app/immich/pull/959\">PR Link</a>).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Thank you</h1>\n<p>Thank you to all the contributors and the users who are helping us by using, testing, and updating the application daily. I cannot do this alone, and I truly appreciate you guys from the bottom of my heart!</p>\n<h1>Support</h1>\n<p>I will use this opportunity to echo the support message on the website here.</p>\n<p>I've committed to this project, and I will not stop.

Unless you have a whole DevOps team,\nit usually brings more problems than benefits, and unnecessary infrastructure bills\nburied a lot of startups before they got anywhere.</p>\n<p>As for prerequisites, you can't be a complete beginner in the world of computers.\nIf you've never even heard of Docker, if you don't know at least something about DNS,\nor if you don't have any experience with Linux, this course is probably not for you.\nThat being said, I do explain the basics too, but probably not in enough detail\nfor a complete beginner.</p>\n<p>The course is available at Udemy, and here's a 100% OFF coupon URL (1000 of those available):</p>\n<p>https://www.udemy.com/course/real-world-devops-project-from-start-to-finish/?couponCode=FREEDEVOPS2211CJDUA</p>\n<p>Be sure to BUY the course for $0, and not sign up for Udemy's subscription plan.\nThe Subscription plan is selected by default, but you want the BUY checkbox.\nIf you see a price other than $0, chances are that all coupons have been used already.</p>\n<p>I encourage you to watch \"free preview\" videos to get the sense of what\nwill be covered, but here's the gist:</p>\n<p>The goal of the course is to create an easily deployable and reproducible server\nwhich will have \"everything\" a startup or a small company will need - VPN, mail, Git,\nCI/CD, messaging, hosting websites and services, sharing files, calendar, etc.\nIt can also be useful to individuals who want to self-host all of those - I ditched Google 99.9%\nand other than that being a good feeling, I'm not worried that some AI bug will lock my account\nwith no one to talk to about resolving the issue.</p>\n<p>Considering that it covers a wide variety of topics, it doesn't go in depth in any of those.\nThink of it as going down a highway towards the end destination, but on the way there I show you\nall the junctions where I think it's useful to do more research on the subject.</p>\n<p>We'll deploy services inside Docker and LXC (Linux Containers). Those will include\na mail server (iRedMail), Zulip (Slack and Microsoft Teams alternative), GitLab (with GitLab Runner and CI/CD),\nNextcloud (file sharing, calendar, contacts, etc.), checkmk (monitoring solution), Pi-hole (ad blocking on DNS level),\nTraefik with Docker and file providers (a single HTTP/S entry point with automatic routing and TLS certificates).</p>\n<p>We'll set up WireGuard, a modern and fast VPN solution for secure access to VPS' internal network,\nand I'll also show you how to get a wildcard TLS certificate with certbot and DNS provider.</p>\n<p>To wrap it all up, we'll write a simple Python application that will compare a list of the desired backups\nwith the list of finished backups, and send a result to a Zulip stream.\nWe'll write the application, do a 'git push' to GitLab which will trigger a CI/CD pipeline\nthat will build a Docker image, push it to a private registry, and then,\nwith the help of the GitLab runner, run it on the VPS and post a result to a Zulip stream with a webhook.</p>\n<p>When done, you'll be equipped to add additional services suited for your needs.</p>\n<p>If you apply the coupon, I'd appreciate if you leave your feedback on Udemy\nafter you're done and spread the word about the course. It would mean a lot.</p>\n<p>I hope that you find it useful.</p>\n<p>Happy learning,\nPredrag</p></div>",

I've mentioned it sometimes in comments, but until now have never felt like it was polished enough to make a post about it.</p>\n<p>KitchenOwl is a cross-platform app with a self-hosted backend. Everything is shared between users, be it recipes, shopping lists, or expenses. It tries to suggest recipes you haven't cooked in a while and adapt to the typical order in which you remove items from the grocery list.</p>\n<p>If you're interested take a quick look at page linked above, there you can find some screenshots and a full list of features.</p>\n<h2>Why did I create KitchenOwl?</h2>\n<p>Me and my roommates always used bring! to keep track of what groceries we needed. Since we also heavily relied on recipes to plan what to cook we wanted to have a common list of recipes and what we needed for them. Bring! only allows to store recipes for yourself and not have a shared list. That's when I looked for self-hosted grocery lists and recipe managers. There where many which I liked like Mealie and Tandoor. But none of them had quite the same capabilities when it came to shopping lists. That's when I decided to just create my own app.</p>\n<p>It started rather basic with just a clone of Bring! but since then I added many many features and functionalities.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Feel free to ask me any questions in the comments.</p></div>",
