So far it's been working great, and I thought I would share how I am using docker to easily selfhost my favorites services.</p>\n<p>Quite a few services are explained in this guide :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Traefik as reverse proxy and SSL manager, it is the core of this infrastructure, arguably the most detailled example</li>\n<li>Bitwarden, Wirehole, Synapse+Element, Nextcloud, Jellyfin,... A multitude of services to selfhost, feel free to choose your favorites</li>\n<li>Backups with a tested custom bash script </li>\n<li>Update with watchtower</li>\n<li>Notifications messages with a selfhosted gotify !</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/BaptisteBdn/docker-selfhosted-apps\">Link to the Github guide</a></p>\n<p>This guide is filled with examples and almost all services are ready to use, with the most difficult one being Traefik as you have to add your DNS provider configuration.\nA simple <code>git clone</code>, as well as modifying the <code>.env</code> should be enough to get you started on your selfhosting journey.</p>\n<p>The only thing not using docker is the backup strategy as it is uses custom bash scripts, I have been using it for a few months to upload my encrypted backups to AWS, and it has been working great. The backup restoration process has also been tested a few times.</p>\n<p>I tried to include as many references as I could and to include security as well, as it can be easily overlooked when selfhosting.</p>\n<p>This guide can be useful for beginners as well as experienced selfhosters looking to migrate to docker, or if you are just interested in seeing how docker works.</p></div>",

Earlier this year, we released Netmaker as a self-hosted project for private networking over WireGuard.

A few years ago I decided to experiment with docker, so I had separate containers for all my services.  </p>\n<p>Now, Nextcloud allows upgrades by one one version number at a time.  So if you want to upgrade from say version 20 to the current version 23 you have to go in steps: first upgrade to 21, then to 22, finally to 23.  I knew this, and have made several successful upgrades in the past.  But what did I do this time?  Tried to upgrade over 2 version numbers, thus breaking my installation.  I thought this might be a nice opportunity to re-install from scratch both Nextcloud and the reverse proxy Traefik, which provides security certificates from LetsEncrypt.   This turned out to be a non-trivial problem, as Traefik has undergone significant changes, and the old config file which I had was incompatible with the new version.  </p>\n<p>Well, if I was going to change all of this - why not upgrade the operating system itself, from Ubuntu 18.04 to 20.04 (both LTS)?  And so I set about doing that, something I've also done before (at least twice in fact).  But this time, after the system went into reboot to complete the upgrade, I couldn't access it again.  I tried to stop and start it from the tools provide by the hosting service, with no luck.  I contacted the admin of the hosting service, who told me that \"Its Grub is broken. That's why you can't stop/start it as it's deep in a failed Grub boot.\"  He recommended a re-image, unless I wanted him to see if he could fix it for me (for which I'd no doubt have to pay for his sys admin time).  </p>\n<p>A re-image would of course destroy everything and replace my system with a new, empty system.  In fact this might not be a bad thing, as I've accumulated all manner of junk over the years; things I've tried out and discarded.  (I used to run <a href=\"https://wordpress.org\">wordpress.org</a>, for example, until maintaining a reasonable level of security was getting troublesome.)</p>\n<p>Anyway, thanks to my hard-won skill (ha!) as a sys admin, I have gone from a working, usable VPS to one that is completely broken.  Go me!</p></div>",

Also i tried Volumio, it has integrations and clean UI, but you can't stream music with it (at least that's what i know). But installation process is easy, pretty much 'out of the box'. Would be nice to have something similar to Volumio with streaming functionality.</p>\n<p>To summarize, i'm looking for Mopidy(Volumio)-like software (self-hosted, streaming, integrations).</p></div>",

They really are a nuisance for me. Sure, I have magnifying glasses and what not for tools, but whenever I need to pull up a specific document, it's back to grinding through folders of pages trying to find the one I need.</p>\n<p>Now that I am moving into a new flat, I want to set up a workflow, where all I would do is shove an incoming document into my scanner, send that to my network (or rather, my printer offers the ability to publish a connected FAT32 thumbdrive as FTP&amp;SMB server in the network) and have a software automate the organization for me.</p>\n<p>Paperless-ng seems like a reasonable option on a RPi 4 but there ought to be others or more, so I wanted to explore this a little more.</p>\n<p>Paperless-ng's automated OCR is pretty neat already. But I would love it if I could define some form of pattern (i.e. by the mail's header) to automatically tag a document. Like if it came from my health care, it always has the same address in the header. So having the document automatically tagged this way would be really helpful.</p>\n<p>I am not sure if Paperless-ng does that. So... got any idea of a self hosted service that does?

Everything is protected and authenticated over the internet with a no-ip domain and a static IP from my ISP and running flawlessly! </p>\n<p>I've come to a point where I get wget any thing, tweak it to my linking, compile and use it. I'm this close to ditching windows if not held back by my current work requirements and go full sudo!</p>\n<p>So why am I here? </p>\n<p>Well, for my use case the Pi has plenty more headroom, but I can only do so much bare metal :( There are so many other services I'd like to host so that I can go full r/degoogle and make my digital life a lot more personal and under my control, but it's just not possible without going into the world or containers (Yes, looking at you docker and k8s's of the world!)</p>\n<p>I feel like a lot of things are behind bars simply because I'm running bare metal. Anyone else on the same boat? Is it worth going 64-bit and docker it all? Or is there anyway I can achieve the same non-docker? It's not that I'm hesitant to learn docker, it's just I convinced my family members to ditch G-drive as well, proudly I might add, and use the tiny yet powerful server lab and the data has been accumulated to a point that It's making me double think my priorities, for now.</p>\n<p>Help a budding linux noob decide what to do! _/\\_</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/poll/rerxlm\">View Poll</a></p></div>",

The rest are only accessible locally or via an OpenVPN server that\u2019s running on my router.</p>\n<p>Throughout this night, I got about 8 emails from the server\u2019s system monitoring about system resources being succeeded. This wasn\u2019t the first time I got an email like this, as I\u2019m running ZFS which keeps taking up over half of my RAM, and Minecraft and Nextcloud can take up the rest once all of my devices connect to autosync photos. I have never gotten so many at once though, except from when I misconfigured Duplicati and it did some weird stuff (I don\u2019t use it anymore).</p>\n<p>I have since taken the Minecraft container offline and derouted the Cloudflare connections to be safe(ish). Unfortunately I only know enough about the front end to build the server, but not nearly enough to know whether I could have been a victim of log4shell.

It includes so much stuff, albeit great, that I don't need or ever use.</p>\n<p>Graylog seemed to be way lighter but it didn't seem stable and hassle free. It kept breaking with unattended updates (meaning no f**#&amp; given just docker-compose pull &amp;&amp; up -d --force-recreate), and when it broke I losts all parser etc. had to pull up from zero, create/import groks pipelines etc.. And honestly, Kibana just looks prettier? Oh.. and yeah, stupid little thing, but in Graylog I cannot reorder columns?! In Kibana I can.</p>\n<p>I tried Grafana + Loki + Promtail. They were such a breeze, extremely lightweight and wile they did work, they are admittedly for different purposes. I didn't seem to be able to handle logs as easily as I could with Graylog or Kibana. Like no pretty columns, easy search etc. Although this might've been my lack of experience with Grafana - please do tell me so as this seems a lovely alternative.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>So is there anything else I can do or try to move away from ELK? Can you create a very basic Kibana-like dashboard in Grafana/Loki? Like add the columns, reorder them, etc? Nothing special but I just couldn't make it work? I either had raw logs and search or columns and all pretty (labels as columns transformation) but no search bar :(</p></div>",

I've tried a few and every one that I've found that allows for SFTP or WebDav is locked away behind a monthly or yearly subscription.  I've got FileScan Pro, but the WebDav (it shows as WebDaw) feature is giving me a 403 error, and the interface is wonky, the save button is stuck under the time and icon bar.</p>\n<p>So really, until I can move back to Android, I'm just looking for something that will work for scanning on the go.  I don't need a ton f features, I just want to be able to dump them to SFTP.

Thought You Like It</p>\n<p>Based on a <em>true story</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>xxx: OK, so, our build engineer has left for another company. The dude was literally living inside the terminal. You know, that type of a guy who loves Vim, creates diagrams in Dot and writes wiki-posts in Markdown... If something - anything - requires more than 90 seconds of his time, he writes a script to automate that.  </p>\n<p>xxx: So we're sitting here, looking through his, uhm, \"legacy\"  </p>\n<p>xxx: You're gonna love this  </p>\n<p>xxx: <strong>smack-my-bitch-up.sh</strong> - sends a text message \"late at work\" to his wife (apparently). Automatically picks reasons from an array of strings, randomly. Runs inside a cron-job. The job fires if there are active SSH-sessions on the server after 9pm with his login.  </p>\n<p>xxx: <strong>kumar-asshole.sh</strong> - scans the inbox for emails from \"Kumar\" (a DBA at our clients). Looks for keywords like \"help\", \"trouble\", \"sorry\" etc. If keywords are found - the script SSHes into the clients server and rolls back the staging database to the latest backup. Then sends a reply \"no worries mate, be careful next time\".  </p>\n<p>xxx: <strong>hangover.sh</strong> - another cron-job that is set to specific dates. Sends automated emails like \"not feeling well/gonna work from home\" etc. Adds a random \"reason\" from another predefined array of strings. Fires if there are no interactive sessions on the server at 8:45am.  </p>\n<p>xxx: (and the oscar goes to) <strong>fucking-coffee.sh</strong> - this one waits exactly 17 seconds (!), then opens a telnet session to our coffee-machine (we had no frikin idea the coffee machine is on the network, runs linux and has a TCP socket up and running) and sends something like sys brew. Turns out this thing starts brewing a mid-sized half-caf latte and waits another 24 (!) seconds before pouring it into a cup. The timing is exactly how long it takes to walk to the machine from the dudes desk.  </p>\n<p>xxx: holy sh*t I'm keeping those</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>The Link To This Repo Is <a href=\"https://github.com/NARKOZ/hacker-scripts\">Here</a>.</p>\n<p>You Can ALSO FIND THESE SCRIPTS THERE</p>\n<p>HOPE IT MADE YOU LAUGH.</p></div>",

The concept is based on the Bucket Budgeting Principle.</p>\n<p>The concept in short: Instead of categories you have multiple \"Buckets\" where you distribute your income. Your expenses are then consuming the money which is available in the respective Bucket.</p>\n<p>For quite a long time I used <a href=\"https://www.budgetwithbuckets.com\">Buckets App</a> but I was not really happy with historical data visualization and missing bucket versioning. So I started making my own app and added things that I wanted for my own use cases.</p>\n<p>I shared the project on <a href=\"https://github.com/TheAxelander/OpenBudgeteer\">Github</a> in case someone is also interested in it and/or wants to give some feedback.</p>\n<p>OpenBudgeteer is available as <a href=\"https://hub.docker.com/r/axelander/openbudgeteer\">Docker Container</a> and requires MySql or Sqlite as database.</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/dhre56k0xp181.png?width=1668&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e568a385360112fa844f6208958d7845061ac7a3</p></div>",

Everything is  energy efficient, virtualized, and automated, and I only use the cloud and closed-source software where I am absolutely forced to by my employer or because a viable open source alternative does not exist (yet). Sure, updates and full disks provide some welcome opportunities for logging into my servers, but fixing things for me is not the most enjoyable part of the hobby.</p>\n<p>Some evenings, I try to revive the old thrill by fiddling with new services, alternatives to the existing ones and fine-tuning stuff, but the gains are just too marginal to be worth it. I tried to move on to new hobbies, but I have found nothing which comes close to the combination of learning about hardware and software (and their interplay), the feeling of autonomy and control, and the practical use value that is provided by creating my very own digital infrastructure. </p>\n<p>Does anyone know this feeling and have you found a way to deal with it?</p></div>",

It features improved Search (Full-Text/Customizable), Meal Planning, custom Bootstrap theme, improved recipe editing, a new cookbook view, tree structures for Foods/Keywords/Units and much more. </p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/8nmkl63gklx71.png?width=144&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5661a2c37de63bc575032007f07a04906f7469d2</p>\n<p>I cant believe another 8 month have passed again since I <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/lmpolh/tandoor_recipes_big_new_release_of_the_most/\">last</a> brought you the latest and greatest news about Tandoor recipes but I am happy that due to an awesome team of collaborators the release of version 1.0.0 has finally arrived today.</p>\n<p>If you don't feel like reading you can open the <a href=\"https://app.tandoor.dev/accounts/login/?demo\">demo</a>, look at <a href=\"https://github.com/TandoorRecipes/recipes\">GitHub</a> or read the <a href=\"https://docs.tandoor.dev/\">docs</a> on how to get started. There is also a new <a href=\"https://tandoor.dev/\">Website/Hosted Version</a> which aims to bring Tandoor to people not able or willing to Self-Host (currently only available in germany). You can also now chat with me, other contributors and users of tandoor on our new <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RhzBrfWgtp\">discord</a>.</p>\n<p>But lets get into some of the awesome things the past months have brought to tandoor</p>\n<h1>Search</h1>\n<p>Due to the tireless works of one of our greatest contributors, <a href=\"https://github.com/smilerz\">smilerz</a>, the search has been reworked from the ground up allowing a high degree of customization depending on your needs and also much better discoverability due to now searching on full text indices covering not only the recipe title but also description, ingredients, instructions and more.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/eudg4bhrfkx71.png?width=945&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b59acc542678bf688a15b3ccb73762ed0910d92\">Improved Search View and Functions</a></p>\n<p>The search has also gotten a complete UI rework with standardized result cards now being used across the application.</p>\n<h1>Meal Planning</h1>\n<p>Meal Planning, a feature implemented due to Feedback under my <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/eo2z2l/self_hosted_recipe_management_tool/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">first post</a> here, has seen an complete rewrite since the last post improving on UI/UX while also offering a more stable foundation for future improvements.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/zlpoe0znrkx71.png?width=1368&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=195c92a169af618e4ae8dd3603d11c58bb6f7df2\">New Meal Planner UI</a></p>\n<p>While the current version offers just the features the last one did with improved usability and design it is planned to add features like automatic planning, nutrition based views, CalDav Based bi-directional calendar syncing and much more.</p>\n<h1>Other Features</h1>\n<p>Foods, Keywords and Units can now be organized in a <strong>tree like data structure</strong> allowing for more fine grained control over hierarchy and search options. Along with this also came a <strong>new standardized list view</strong> which allows for <strong>moving, merging</strong>, editing and deleting of various database objects in a fully responsive and <strong>modern new Vue.js</strong> frontend.</p>\n<p>The <strong>navigation</strong> has long outgrown the features so version 0.17.0 completely overhauled its structure to reflect on the most prominent and often used features in the newer versions of tandoor. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/fo0unmgtukx71.png?width=1368&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a21cb3d2f103fa4947e6b43a62cceea364d1893\">New Recipe Books Page</a></p>\n<p>To combine the benefits of good old analog cookbooks with the modern digital data tandoor provides we have reworked the <strong>cookbook view</strong> to offer a more detailed but still quick look into the recipes collected inside a book. It is now also possible to filter for books on the search page.</p>\n<p>To allow you to host tandoor not only for yourself and your next ones you can now also have <strong>multiple tennants</strong> (so called spaces) in your application and thus bring self hosted, privacy first recipe management to your friends and extended family. This works similarly to Nextclouds user accounts but with more focus on having multiple people collaborate on each space.</p>\n<p>This of course are not all the things we have been up to in the last months, if you want to know everything feel free to take a look at the <a href=\"https://github.com/TandoorRecipes/recipes/releases\">changelog</a>.</p>\n<h1>Roadmap</h1>\n<p>While many features have already been implemented there are hundreds of ideas still waiting for implementation and more are added every day by our great community. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>A complete overhaul of how nutrition tracking is done and how it integrates into different features like meal planning, logging, and shopping is planned to help people pay more attention to what they eat (<a href=\"https://github.com/TandoorRecipes/recipes/issues/896\">GitHub Issue</a>).</li>\n<li><strong>Automations</strong> are already implemented in a very early beta stage to remove repetitive tasks and keep your instance clean allowing you to for example automatically rename foods on import. Once a certain technical maturity is reached this should be expanded to many more parts of the application (<a href=\"https://github.com/TandoorRecipes/recipes/issues/167\">GitHub Issue</a>)</li>\n<li>While improving on the features for internal recipes <strong>files and external recipes</strong> will get their round of attention improving the UI/UX and likely adding new features like (automatic) OCR, split views and more. </li>\n<li><strong>Shopping</strong> lists are already working quite well but over the time we have noticed some limitations of the current technical approach. This is why we are currently working on completely refactoring the shopping system (<a href=\"https://github.com/TandoorRecipes/recipes/issues/893\">GitHub Issue</a>).</li>\n<li>While the system of having steps of different types for recipes has worked well in the past recent additions like sub recipes, files and more have shown its limitations. We plan on making steps more dynamic and showing better UIs depending on which data is actually added to a step.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Feel free to add you own ideas to the agenda by raising an issue on GitHub or reading trough all the <a href=\"https://github.com/TandoorRecipes/recipes/issues\">ideas</a> others have filed over time.</p>\n<p>Many thanks to all the people who have made this possible, I am looking forward to what the next years bring. I would be happy to hear your feedback and maybe even why or how you have been using tandoor.</p></div>",

We are currently still in the MVP stage, but we hope that over-time, with feedback from the community, we can offer a competitive drop-in replacement for Plex, Emby and Jellyfin. </p>\n<p>Features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>CPU Transcoding</li>\n<li>Hardware accelerated transcoding (with some runtime feature detection)</li>\n<li>Transmuxing</li>\n<li>Subtitle streaming</li>\n<li>Support for common movie, tv show and anime naming schemes</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Why another media manager?</strong></p>\n<p>We feel like Plex is starting to abandon the idea of home media servers, not to mention that the centralization makes using plex a pain (their auth servers are a bit.......unstable....). Jellyfin is a worthy alternative but unfortunately it is quite unstable and doesn't perform well on large collections. We want to build a modern media manager which offers the same UX and user friendliness as Plex minus all the centralization that comes with it.</p></div>",

That was encouraging, so I got coding, and here I am a few months later with an MVP launch of the product: <a href=\"https://github.com/nitnelave/lldap\">https://github.com/nitnelave/lldap</a></p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>It's a simple user management webapp (SPA) with users and groups, that comes with a basic read-only LDAP server. That means you can plug in your Jellyfin, your Nextcloud, your Authelia or even your Keycloak and they will use this as the source of truth for your users!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/v0cs0qxd8du71.png?width=1320&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4612e976f29210ed88cba7cf4ad8cea859803c54\">Screenshot of the user management page</a></p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Note that this is a Minimum Viable Product, and as such it implements only the very basic features. The roadmap can be found here: <a href=\"https://github.com/nitnelave/lldap/projects/2\">https://github.com/nitnelave/lldap/projects/2</a>, starting with allowing a password change through LDAP to reset the passwords via Authelia/Keycloak/other and allowing a password reset through email (currently only the admin can change your password if you forgot it).</p>\n<p>If you find any bugs, feel free to <a href=\"https://github.com/nitnelave/lldap/issues\">create an issue</a> on GitHub.</p>\n<p>You can install it via <a href=\"https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/nitnelave/lldap\">docker</a> (easiest) or run it directly from source, the instructions are in the README.</p>\n<p>Feel free to join us on <a href=\"https://discord.gg/h5PEdRMNyP\">Discord</a>, and follow me on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nitnelave1\">Twitter</a> for updates on the project!</p>\n<p>For those who already tried the server before the MVP release: &gt;!The password hashing scheme was slightly changed to speed up logging in, which has the unfortunate consequence that all passwords are now invalid, including the admin one. Either delete the DB (`rm users.db` or using SQlite, delete the admin user `DELETE FROM users WHERE id = \"admin\";`).!&lt;</p></div>",
