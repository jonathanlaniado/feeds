Not part of the setup. </p>\n<p>The one in the middle is my old PC. It now has Windows 11, running source control and CI. It also has VirtualBox with two (for now VMs).</p>\n<p>The first VM is an OpenBSD load balancer, which is the one that is connected to the outside world. Relayd does the reverse proxying with SNI, and the SSL certificates are provided by letsencrypt.</p>\n<p>The second VM is an Ubuntu Server machine, with a full LAMP attack for the various websites I have.</p>\n<p>The box on the right is a NAS, keeping backups of my source code, backups of the VM, and the daily builds of my game. </p>\n<p>Moving forward I'll only be using AWS for domain registration and DNS, but I may even move that somewhere else. </p>\n<p>What do you think of my setup?</p><div><br></div><img src=\"https://i.redd.it/hifni8ea2o0e1.jpeg\" />",

While existing solutions like Snowboy, PocketSphinx, and Sensory have been valuable to the community, we saw an opportunity to create a modern alternative that meets current performance and usability standards. Picovoice Porcupine is a notable exception with its model platform, and we appreciate its contribution to the field.</p>\n<p>Unlike cloud-based solutions such as AWS, our platform operates entirely on-device, ensuring data privacy and offering immediate setup for custom keywords without long waiting periods.</p>\n<p>Key Features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ensuring Privacy - We are running On-Device. No data is transferred over the internet, ensuring user conversations remain private!</li>\n<li>Superior Accuracy with low footprint and low resource consumptions: Benchmarked against leading competitors, our technology offers the necessary superior\u2014accuracy for user satisfaction, making it ideal for real-world applications.</li>\n<li>Ease of Implementation: Super straightforward to integrate into your React Native projects. With clear examples and minimal code, you can have keyword detection up and running in no time.</li>\n<li>Cross-Platform Support: Fully compatible with both iOS and Android in React Native.</li>\n<li>Low Latency: Experience near-instantaneous keyword detection without lag.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Tech Stack:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>React Native</li>\n<li>ONNX Runtime</li>\n<li>JavaScript/TypeScript</li>\n<li>Native Modules for iOS and Android</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Email: <a href=\"mailto:ofer@davoice.io\">ofer@davoice.io</a></p>\n<p>Happy coding, and we're looking forward to your feedback and contributions! \ud83c\udf89</p>",

I am incredibly excited to have created something that could presumably be used by others who might enjoy it in the same way that I have enjoyed these types of services for the greater part of my life!</p>\n<p>This project is called <strong>Retrom</strong>, and is most simply described as an emulation library frontend. However, the thing that sets Retrom apart is it's first-class support for centralized, self-hosted game libraries. I am aware that this is a bit of a niche that Retrom is targeting, but I am sure there are plenty of users here that have large libraries of retro games sitting on their NAS that could possibly see some use from this. I mean, how small could the intersection of retro game collectors, emulation enthusiasts, data archivists and home-lab enthusiasts be, really??</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Download links, docs and source code can all be found at the</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/jmberesford/retrom\"><strong>github repository</strong></a><strong>, for those interested</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Retrom is still in the early stages of development, but I'm excited to share it with you all and get feedback. I'm certain there are bugs to be found, and I would not describe Retrom as <em>fully-featured</em> yet, but I'm excited to see what others think and would like to use the feedback to guide future development.</p>\n<h1>Here is a list of Retrom's main features:</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Self Hosted Game Libraries</strong>: Retrom is designed with self-hosted game libraries in mind. This means that you can host your own game library on your own server, and Retrom will be able to access it. Simply spin up the Retrom service in a docker container (binary distribution coming soon), and point it to your game library.</li>\n<li><strong>Game Metadata and Covers</strong>: Retrom will automatically download metadata and covers for your games, and display them in a beautiful and easy to use UI. Metadata and images are automatically sourced from supported providers, and can be manually edited if needed.</li>\n<li><strong>Desktop and Web Clients</strong>: Connect any amount of clients to your Retrom service, and they will all be able to manage, install and play your games. Large libraries need not take up space on your local machine, and you can access your games from anywhere.</li>\n<li><strong>Multi-platform</strong>: Retrom's desktop client is available for use on Windows, MacOS, and Linux. The web client is accessible on any device with a modern web browser, and can be easily deployed via docker alongside the service.</li>\n<li><strong>First Class Emulation Support</strong>: Retrom has first-class support for emulation, and is designed with flexibility in mind. You can configure the Retrom client to launch games with any emulator you have installed on your machine, and further configure launch profiles for each emulator (e.g. launch in fullscreen/launch in windowed profiles).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>The next major milestones on the roadmap for Retrom are as follows:</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>User Authentication and Permissions</strong>: Retrom will soon support user authentication and permissions. This means that you can create user accounts for your friends and family, and give them access to your game library.</li>\n<li><strong>Standalone Mode</strong>: Retrom will soon support a standalone mode, where the service and client are bundled together in a single binary. This will make it easier to get started with Retrom, and will be especially useful for users who don't want to host their own game library.</li>\n<li><strong>Fullscreen UI and Gamepad Support</strong>: The desktop client will soon have a fullscreen UI mode, and will support gamepad input. This will make Retrom a great choice for use on a TV or other large screen.</li>\n<li><strong>Cloud Save Support</strong>: Retrom will soon support cloud saves for your games. This means that you can save your game progress to your retrom service, and pick up where you left off on any device.</li>\n<li><strong>Built-in Emulator Profiles</strong>: Retrom will soon ship with built-in emulator profiles for popular emulators. This will make it easier to get started with emulation, and will make it easier to configure your emulators for use with Retrom.</li>\n<li><strong>Additional Metadata Providers</strong>: Retrom will soon support additional metadata providers. Currently, Retrom uses IGDB for metadata and cover images, but additional providers like SteamGridDB will be added in the future.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Screenshots</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/32m27g1yf2pd1.jpg?width=1843&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=73aba91ae2fe3f3712ddffdb1ba05e645ef9accb\">Home screen</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/rbg5ch1yf2pd1.jpg?width=1623&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=551b8ff9181b9cd2c7173b132cec79da5cb67e6d\">Game view</a></p>",

With TailScale, TailScale itself exposes ports. You authenticate and connect to those ports, which then connect you back to the reverse connection from your home. Ports are exposed at TailScale. TailScale gets access to your home network. You would have a lower attack surface if you just opened a VPN port in your home. If your security requirements and threat model allow for using TailScale then it's totally fine to use it, but the idea that TailScale doesn't expose ports is a half-truth.</p>\n<p>2: If you use a reverse proxy the way OP does, attackers will be able to scan your web server, identify web server vulnerabilities, and pop into your network!</p>\n<p>No. mTLS requires the attacker to have a valid private key to authenticate to the reverse proxy. If a valid private key and certificate are not there, <strong>then the attacker cannot begin scanning the web app.</strong> The mTLS handshake happens before the attacker can probe the web service. If you don't believe me, use <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9eVf2uleaA\">WireShark and see how a TLS connection works</a>. Even over regular TLS, you will see that the TLS connection happens first, before any HTTP traffic is transmitted. Better yet, host your own mTLS instance, scan 443 without a private key and see what data you get back.</p>\n<p>3: If you expose a port, even if it requires a private key to connect to it, you are less secure than if you use WireGuard, which requires an authenticated packet before it responds.</p>\n<p>No. WireGuard allows you to avoid confirming or denying that a port is open, since it's over UDP and most systems don't respond if you try to interact to a nonexistent service over UDP. This, on its own, does not make WireGuard more secure than say TCP OpenVPN or mTLS. It does, however, prevent people looking at your IP address from knowing if you are running some sort of authentication-required service. If this increases your risk, then you can choose to use WireGuard, instead, but this is not the case for a vast majority of people.</p>\n<p>For more information on mTLS, see <a href=\"https://smallstep.com/docs/mtls/\">Hello mTLS</a> by the awesome people at Smallstep. They also have a cool tutorial on using Yubikeys with mTLS <a href=\"https://smallstep.com/blog/access-your-homelab-anywhere/\">here</a> to connect back to the homelab, similar to how OP is running his homelab.</p>\n<p>The great part about using Yubikeys for mTLS is it allows you to have a hardware-backed, two-factor authentication method at layer 6, rather than traditional MFA which is at layer 7. This allows MFA with a lower attack surface, since the attacker can't look for any web vulnerabilities to bypass MFA.</p>",

Of course I am not talking here about applications which involve serving dozens of devices and users with 99.99% uptime, I am talking home media server and some additional VMs/containers.</p>\n<p>Here is why:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Can be bought used for cheap (&lt;200\u20ac for i5 10th gen, 100\u20ac for 5-bay DAS). Most of the time better value than prebuilt NASs.</li>\n<li>Very small form factor and noise, perfect to hide in a closet somewhere or in the corner of a room.</li>\n<li>Some models can also be fitted with a NIC to go beyond gigabit speeds (alternatively, many mini PCs on Aliexpress now come with 2.5G).</li>\n<li>Very low power consumption. Maybe more relevant for Europe where electricity is not cheap.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Of course you could argue that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is usually less expandable, in terms of CPU/RAM/storage. Regarding the storage, if you buy a sufficiently large DAS from the start, you have room for additional drives later on.</li>\n<li>These machines are typically less capable than full-on servers but I believe that not everybody actually needs a server rack and 512GB RAM at home.</li>\n<li>They are also less reliable (not UPS, redundant power supply, etc) but for home purposes, I believe this is less relevant.</li>\n<li>DAS are sometime considered unreliable, especially with RAID setups. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>That's all I have, interested to hear your thoughts.</p>",

I'm here today to provide you with some changes I introduced in Dawarich.</p>\n<p>For those unfamiliar, <a href=\"https://github.com/Freika/dawarich\">Dawarich</a> is a self-hosted alternative to Google Location History and Owntracks</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/lgqgouibhdmd1.png?width=3096&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1c14ac4280aeefa50502d6856c5afe6f4f4d941</p>\n<p>So, the last time I posted an update here on Reddit, it was on Dawarich 0.7.0, more than two months ago. Today I'll share changes made to the application since, and in the future, I'm planning to post release updates on a monthly basis.</p>\n<p>I'll cover only significant changes, although there are also a whole lot of small ones. So, here we go!</p>\n<h1>Added</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Fog of War. Yes, exactly like in your favorite RTS game!</li>\n<li>Primitive user management. The first user in the system is now the admin and can create new users. Nobody will be able to use your Dawarich instance without your knowledge.</li>\n<li>Full support for the <a href=\"https://support.google.com/maps/thread/264641290/export-full-location-timeline-data-in-json-or-similar-format-in-the-new-version-of-timeline?hl=en\">third</a> (yes, third) kind of Google's Takeout location history file.</li>\n<li>A simple notification system. You'll receive a notification when any of your background processes is finished. Non-live yet, requires a page reload.</li>\n<li>API endpoints</li>\n<li>`/api/v1/areas` (GET, POST)</li>\n<li>`/api/v1/area/:id` (PATCH/PUT, DELETE)</li>\n<li>`/api/v1/points` (GET)</li>\n<li>`/api/v1/point/:id` (DELETE)</li>\n<li>`/api/v1/visit/:id` (PATCH/PUT)</li>\n<li>`/api/v1/stats` (GET)</li>\n<li>Swagger docs for the API. Available at `/api-docs`.</li>\n<li>Support for multiple hosts. You can now provide multiple domains and IP addresses by which you want Dawarich to be available.</li>\n<li>Support for HTTPS protocol.</li>\n<li>Background jobs page, where you can start or re-start the reverse geocoding process for your points.</li>\n<li>Point can now be deleted right from the map. Just click on it, and then click on \"Delete\" in the popup.</li>\n<li>Some map settings can now be changed in user settings.</li>\n<li>Those who want to host their own Photon instance for reverse geocoding without limitations now can do that and point Dawarich to it with `PHOTON_API_HOST` env variable.</li>\n<li>Visits functionality. You can now draw an area on the map, give it a name (i.e. \"Parent's house\") and Dawarich will scan your visits there and suggest them to be confirmed or declined on the Visits page.</li>\n<li>Places &amp; Visit suggestion. Oooh this is huge. And it's still in beta. Basically, Dawarich scans through all your points, detects groups of them in space and time, and makes a suggestion: this is a Visit. If possible (and if reverse geocoding is enabled), it will also try to suggest a name of the place you visited.</li>\n<li>Map settings are moved directly to the map itself</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Fixed</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Hovering over a route on the Map page will no longer move the map. But click on a route will, it will move to show both the start and the finish of the route.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Changed</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Registration is now disabled and new users can be only created by the very first user in the system (or an admin, or via console).</li>\n<li>Reverse geocoding process now saves all data it fetched, not just city and country</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, I'd like to talk a bit about Visits suggestions. It's currently in its beta version, and the ultimate goal is to have Dawarich reliably suggest places you visited, also providing you with a list of names of potential places that you could have visited. Current implementation if a first step, and initial visits suggestion, depending on the amount of points you tracked or imported, might take a few hours and consume some considerable resources. With that in mind, it might be smart to limit resources (like that, for example: <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42345235/how-to-specify-memory-cpu-limit-in-docker-compose-version-3\">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42345235/how-to-specify-memory-cpu-limit-in-docker-compose-version-3</a> ) available to Dawarich to not crash your server.</p>\n<p>The main focus for now would be probably honing existing features, especially the Visits suggestions feature, although I'll also be working on some other stuff, such as extending the API, supporting different types of export files, and some others. I invite you all to <a href=\"https://github.com/Freika/dawarich/discussions\">Github Discussions</a> to ask your questions and bring your ideas.</p>\n<p>Feel free to support the project on <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/freika\">Patreon</a>, <a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/freika\">Ko-fi</a> or using crypto (address is in the project README) if you find it useful :)</p>\n<p>To save you a scroll:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Freika/dawarich\">https://github.com/Freika/dawarich</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://dawarich.app\">https://dawarich.app</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cheers!</p>",

One redditor labeled them NPC dads. </p>\n<p>I've seen some comments on this subreddit from Dads who wonder if their kids appreciate the sweet setup they've created for them. If you feel that way, you may be confusing effort with value. Sure, you spend a lot of time and put in a lot of hard work, and it feels worth it. But for the rest of your family, it probably just looks like you're playing games, and if we're being fair, we kind of are -- we enjoy the challenge and the opportunity to learn soemthing new, which is basically makes selfhosting a semi productive game. </p>\n<p>Is it worth it? You may see yourself as a hero, but doesn't everybody want to be the hero of their own story? You might want to check with your family (your spouse included) if they think it's all worth your time, or if they'd rather you spent time with them or helped out in other ways. </p>",

It's a native app unlike official client, so it uses less memory, and more battery-efficient.</p>\n<p>Over past few months I've added a bunch of changes, fixes and improvements. The most notable are</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Playlist support - create/delete playlists, add/remove songs from playlists</li>\n<li>Media keys support on MacOS(play/pause next/prev)</li>\n<li>Dynamic progress bar color(matches album cover art dominant color)</li>\n<li>Sorting</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are many more changes under the hood to make app more stable. App is fully open sourced and available to check here - <a href=\"https://github.com/avdept/JellyBoxPlayer\">https://github.com/avdept/JellyBoxPlayer</a></p>\n<p>Right now I support macOS, iOS and android as APK file in downloads section(soon I will release it to google play).</p>\n<p>There are few more features I currently work on, so stay tuned!</p>",

Alex from Immich here, and I am back with another development progress update for the project.</p>\n<p>Summer has returned once again, and the night sky is filled with stars; thank you for <strong>38_000 shining stars</strong> you have sent to our <a href=\"https://github.com/immich-app/immich\">GitHub repo</a>! Since the last announcement, several core contributors have started working full-time. Everything is going great with development, PRs get merged with <em>brrrrrrr</em> rate, conversation exchange between team members is on a new high, we met and are working with the great engineers at FUTO. The spirit is high, and we have a lot of things brewing that we think you will like.</p>\n<p>Let's go over some of the updates we had since the last post.</p>\n<h1>Container consolidation</h1>\n<p>Reduced the number of total containers from 5 to 4 by making the microservices threads get spawned directly in the server container. Woohoo, remember when Immich had 7 containers?</p>\n<h1>Email notifications SMTP</h1>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/xbuff7myqy9d1.png?width=1342&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=56007ddd86823ca0e0f020ade80d25f90d2f8bae</p>\n<p>We added  email notifications to the app with SMTP settings that you can configure for the following events:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A new account is created for you.</li>\n<li>You are added to a shared album.</li>\n<li>New media is added to an album.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Versioned docs</h1>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/dtxszggzqy9d1.png?width=224&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=00d034a7f8a973c317cef7b3ba73be322f9dc703</p>\n<p>You can now jump back into the past or take a peek at the unreleased version of the documentation by selecting the version on the website.</p>\n<h1>Similarity deduplication</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/yo64yhdsqy9d1.png?width=2620&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77b68a8d640fa593c544ee8636e894b12bb3f07e\">Similarity deduplication control panel</a></p>\n<p>With more machine learning and CLIP magic, we now have similarity deduplication built into the application where it will search for closely similar images and let you decide what to do with them; i.e keep or trash.</p>\n<h1>Permanent URL for assets on the web</h1>\n<p>The detail view for an asset now has a permanent URL, so you can easily share it with your loved ones.</p>\n<h1>Web app translations</h1>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/1fi0pl41ry9d1.png?width=1149&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c405a3409d3d42af3f9d99b3fd514e39d9648dc6</p>\n<p>We now have a public Weblate project, which the community can use to translate the web app to their native languages. We are planning to port the mobile app translation to this platform as well. If you would like to contribute, you can take a look <a href=\"https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/immich/immich/\">here</a>. We're already close to 50% translations - we really appreciate everyone contributing to that!</p>\n<h1>Read-only/Editor mode on the shared album</h1>\n<p>As the owner of the album, you can choose if the shared user can edit the album or only view the content of the album without any modification.</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/xdkx2sm3ry9d1.png?width=1206&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=929d30f664bf77639f550c89f23000334b970373</p>\n<h1>Better video thumbnails</h1>\n<p>Immich now tries to find a descriptive video thumbnail instead of simply using the first frame. No more black images for thumbnails!</p>\n<h1>Public Roadmap</h1>\n<p>We now have a <a href=\"https://immich.app/roadmap\">public roadmap</a>, giving you a high-level overview of things the team is working on. The first goal of this roadmap is to bring Immich to a stable release, which is expected sometime later this year. Some of the highlights include</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Auto stacking - Auto stacking of burst photos</li>\n<li>Basic editor - Basic photo editing capabilities</li>\n<li>Workflows - Automate tasks with workflows</li>\n<li>Fine-grained access controls - Granular access controls for users and API keys</li>\n<li>Better background backups - Rework background backups to be more reliable</li>\n<li>Private/locked photos - Private assets with extra protections</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Beyond the items in the roadmap, we have <em>many many</em> more ideas for Immich. The team and I hope that you are enjoying the application, find it helpful in your life and we have nothing but the intention of building out great software for you all!</p>\n<p>Have an amazing Summer or Winter for those in the southern hemisphere! :D</p>\n<p>Until next time,</p>\n<p>Cheers! Alex</p>",

There are many complaints of pressure tactics trying to move customers up to the next Cloudflare tier.</p>\n<p>While this mostly affects corporate customers, us homelabbers and selfhosters should keep a wary eye on these developments. We mostly use the free, or maybe the cheapo business tier.\u00a0 Cloudflare wants to make money, and they are not making enough. Once you get hooked and dependent on their free stuff, prepare to eventually be asked for money, or be kicked out.</p>\n<p>Therefore:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Do not get dependent on Cloudflare.</strong> Always ask yourself what to do if they shut you down.</li>\n<li><strong>Always keep your domain registration separate from Cloudflare</strong>. \u00a0Register the domain elsewhere, delegate DNS to Cloudflare. If things get nasty, simply delegate your DNS away, and point it straight to your website.</li>\n<li>Without Cloudflare caching, your website would be a bit slower, but you are still up and running, and you can look for another CDN vendor.</li>\n<li>For those of us using the nifty cloudflared tunnel to run stuff at home without exposing our private parts to the Internet, being shut out from Cloudflare won\u2019t be the end. <a href=\"https://slashdot.org/software/p/Cloudflare-Tunnel/alternatives\"><strong>There are alternatives</strong></a> <strong>(maybe.)</strong>  Push comes to shove, we could go ghetto until a better solution is found, and stick one of those cheapo mini-PCs into the  DMZ before the router/firewall, and treat&amp;administer it like a VPS rented elsewhere.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Should Cloudflare ever kick you out of their free paradise, you shouldn\u2019t be down for more than a few minutes. If you are down for hours, or days, you are not doing it right.\u00a0 Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love Cloudflare, and I use it a lot. But we should be prepared for the love-affair turning sour.</p>",

Found Plex and found out how to download movies/TV shows.</p>\n<p>Then manually searching for content became a pain. So I automated the process with my Arr stack.</p>\n<p>Then in 2020 I found network chuck who introduced me to docker with his portainer video. Along with the basics of Linux &amp; Networking.</p>\n<p>Fast forward 4 years now (24 now)  I have a whole homelab infrastructure. 2 proxmox nodes, TrueNas, AWX, Cloud machines, authentik, probably 45 Virtual machines in total all for different services. 7 domains and countless subdomains, CI/CD for Git repos, etc. If it's open source and can be installed in a homelab, ive probably tried it.</p>\n<p>Anyway, before this I didn't know anything about Linux/tech. Was working a sales job. But this has became an addiction lol. I fully credit this subreddit for showing me what's all out there.</p>\n<p>I don't have any certs so getting IT job was gonna be hard.\nOne day I finally said I'm done with sales and applied for some IT jobs. Got an interview at a VOIP company and I didn't know a thing about VoIP but they were impressed with my homelab and understanding of systems, so they hired me.</p>\n<p>Now here I am 8 weeks later, working on PBX systems, SSH'ing into Linux servers and troubleshooting, remoting into clients networks, configuring VM's, etc. Basically exactly what I do at home. And doing so well some of the more advanced people in the office think I should moving up to sysadmin.</p>\n<p>Most of my coworkers all have A+, Net+ and Sec+ and I'm hanging right in there with them, I teach them things that I've learned by going the self hosted route, they teach me things from the certificate route.</p>\n<p>Anyways, I just wanted to thank this subreddit. Thanks for sharing your open source projects, thanks for all the help I've received over the last few years. I guess it is all starting to pay off. If I can do it you can too.</p>",

I have never seen this mentioned anywhere or in any tutorial I have ever followed. </p>\n<p>When you spin up a docker container using the host network its port mappings will override your firewall rules and open those ports, even if you already created a rule to block that port. Might not be that big of a deal unless you\u2019re on a publicly accessible system like a VPS! </p>\n<p>When you\u2019re setting up a container you need to modify your port bindings for any ports you don\u2019t want accessible over the internet. </p>\n<p>Using NGINX Proxy Manager as an example:</p>\n<p><code>ports:\n    - \u201880:80\u2019\n    - \u2018443:443\u2019\n    - \u201881:81\u2019</code></p>\n<p>Using these default port bindings will open all those ports to the internet including the admin UI on port 81. I would assume most of us would rather manage things through a VPN and only have the ports open that we truly need open. Especially considering that port 81 in this case is standard http and not encrypted. </p>\n<p>To fix this was surprisingly easy. You need to bind the port to the interface you want. So if you only want local access use <code>127.0.0.1</code> but in my example I\u2019m using Tailscale. </p>\n<p><code>ports:\n    - \u201880:80\u2019\n    - \u2018443:443\u2019\n    - \u2018100.0.0.1:81:81\u2019</code></p>\n<p>This will still allow access to port 81 for management, but only through my Tailscale interface. So now port 81 is no longer open to the internet, but I can still access it through Tailscale. </p>\n<p>Hopefully this is redundant for a lot of people. However I assume if I have gone this long without knowing this then I\u2019m probably not the only one. Hopefully this helps someone. </p>",

Full disclosure: I'm not an advanced user, nor am I an authority on this subject whatsoever. I mainly use reverse proxies for accessing simple local services with SSL behind memorable URLs and haven't dipped my toes into anything more complex than integrating Authentik for SSO. I prefer file-based configuration, avoid complexity, and don't need advanced features; so this list certainly won't be valuable for everyone. Feel free to share your opinions; I'd love to hear what everyone else is using.</p>\n<p>Here's my opinionated review of the reverse proxy solutions I've tried, ranked from most likely to recommend to newcomers to least likely:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://caddyserver.com/docs/quick-starts/reverse-proxy\">Caddy</a>: As easy as it could possibly get, and by far the most painless reverse proxy I've used. It's extremely lightweight, performant, and modular with plenty of extensions. Being able to configure my entire home network's reverse proxy hosts from a single, elegantly formatted Caddyfile is a godsend. Combined with the <a href=\"https://github.com/coder/code-server\">VS Code Server</a> for easy configuration from a browser, I couldn't recommend a more painless solution for beginners who simply want to access their local services behind a TLD without browser warnings. Since I have my own FQDN through Cloudflare but don't have any public-facing services, I personally use the <a href=\"https://github.com/caddy-dns/cloudflare\">Cloudflare DNS provider Caddy addon</a> to benefit from full SSL using just a single line of configuration. Though, if your setup is complex enough to require using the JSON config, or you rely heavily on Docker, you might also consider Traefik.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/\">Traefik</a>: Probably the most powerful and versatile option I've tried, with the necessary complexity and learning curve that entails. Can do everything Caddy can do (perhaps even better depending on who you ask). I still use it on systems I haven't migrated away from Docker as the label system is fantastic. I find the multiple approaches to configuration and the corresponding documentation hard to wrap my head around sometimes, but it's still intuitive. Whether or not I'd recommend Traefik to \"newcomers\" depends entirely on what type of newcomer we're talking about: Someone already self-hosting a few services that knows the basics? Absolutely. My dad who just got a Synology for his birthday? There's probably better options.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://zoraxy.arozos.com/#home\">Zoraxy</a>: The best GUI-based reverse proxy solution I'm familiar with, despite being relatively new to the scene. I grew out of it quickly as it was missing very basic features like SSL via DNS challenges when I last tried it, but I'm still placing it high on the list solely for providing the only viable option for people with a phobia of config files that I currently know of. It also has a really sleek interface, although I can't say anything about long-term stability or performance. YMMV.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.f5.com/go/product/welcome-to-nginx\">NGINX</a>: Old reliable. It's only this far down the list because I prefer Traefik over vanilla NGINX for more complex use cases these days and haven't used it for proxy purposes in recent memory. I have absolutely nothing bad to say about NGINX (besides finding the configuration a bit ugly) and I use it for public-facing services all the time. If you're already using NGINX, you probably have a good reason to, and this list will have zero value to you.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/9bV5zQbrp_Q?t=9\">NGINX Proxy Manager</a>: Unreliable. It's this far down the list because I'd prefer anything over NPM. Don't let its shiny user-friendly frontend fool you, as underneath lies a trove of deceit that will inevitably lead you down a rabbit hole of stale issues and nonexistent documentation. \"I've been using NPM for months and have never had an issue with it.\" WRONG. By the time you've read this, half of your proxy hosts are offline, and the frontend login has inexplicably stopped working. Hyperbole aside, my reasoning for not recommending NPM isn't that it totally broke for me on multiple occasions, but the fact that a major rewrite (v3) is supposedly in the works and the current version probably isn't updated as much as it  should be. If you're starting from scratch right now, I'd recommend anything else for now. Just my experience though, and I'm curious how common this sentiment is.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Honorable mentions</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.linuxserver.io/general/swag/\">SWAG</a>: Haven't used this one since I moved away from Docker, but I've seen it recommended a ton and it seems the <a href=\"http://linuxserver.io\">linuxserver.io</a> guys are held in pretty high regard. It's definitely worth a look if you use Docker or want an alternative Traefik.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.haproxy.org/\">HAProxy</a><strong>:</strong> I didn't include it in the list because I was using the OPNsense addon and nearly went insane in the process. It might have just been the GUI, but it's the only reverse proxy solution I've used that made me actively feel like a moron. Definitely has its purpose, but I personally had no reason to keep putting myself through that   </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Edit: Clarified my reasoning for the NPM listing a bit more as it came off a bit inflammatory, sorry. I lost a lot of sleepless nights to some of those issues.</p>",

Memories are priceless, and privacy should not be a luxury. However, building quality open source has its challenges. Over the past two years, it has taken significant dedication, time, and effort.</p>\n<p>Recently, a company in Austin, Texas, called FUTO contacted the team. FUTO strives to develop quality and sustainable open software. They build software alternatives that focus on giving control to users. From their mission statement:</p>\n<p>\u201cComputers should belong to you, the people. We develop and fund technology to give them back.\u201d</p>\n<p>FUTO loved Immich and wanted to see if we\u2019d consider working with them to take the project to the next level. In short, FUTO offered to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pay the core team to work on Immich full-time</li>\n<li>Let us keep full autonomy about the project\u2019s direction and leadership</li>\n<li>Continue to license Immich under AGPL</li>\n<li>Keep Immich\u2019s development direction with no paywalled features</li>\n<li>Keep Immich \u201cbuilt for the people\u201d (no ads, data mining/selling, or alternative motives)</li>\n<li>Provide us with financial, technical, legal, and administrative support</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After careful deliberation, the team decided that FUTO\u2019s vision closely aligns with our own: to build a better future by providing a polished, performant, and privacy-preserving open-source software solution for photo and video management delivered in a sustainable way.</p>\n<p>Immich\u2019s future has never looked brighter, and we look forward to realizing our vision for Immich as part of FUTO.</p>\n<p>See our post <a href=\"https://immich.app/blog/2024/immich-core-team-goes-fulltime\">here</a> for full details about this change, including answers to frequently asked questions.

Not just slower than it should be, not just slow to sync files, but slow in every single respect. We're talking 3-5 seconds to load every web page slow. We're talking 100KB-300KB max transfer rate slow. It's been truly unusably slow. In the last 3 years I have poured more hours than I care to think about into performance tuning. Modifying PHP FPM settings, throwing more CPU+RAM at the problem, playing with disk mount parameters. The works. In all that time I've gotten page loads down to 2-3 seconds and transfers to reliably hit 1MB. Better, but still dear lord.</p>\n<p>Between this issue and the fact that every time I update it I have to essentially rebuild the application because something breaks, I had essentially written off Nextcloud. It was good enough for the things I didn't care about customizing (calendar, file sync, phone backup, etc) as long as I use external clients instead of the web interface. Oh well, maybe someday I'll revisit it and switch to something else.</p>\n<p>A bit about my setup for background: I run a distributed cluster currently with 5 nodes all of which have storage and compute resources. Docker Swarm manages container orchestration and GlusterFS pools the storage blocks into one replicated network disk. Within Swarm I have stacks for each application I run and one \"core\" stack that handles common resources like the reverse proxy, LetsEncrypt, etc. So I have a Nextcloud stack with its own containers isolated and the reverse proxy simply handles SSL termination and forwarding 80/443 to that stack where it gets picked up by the web server within the Nextcloud stack.</p>\n<p>Fast forward to last week and I found <a href=\"https://github.com/flor0/nextcloud-docker\">this repo</a> that uses a custom built FPM container to run Nextcloud. Up until now I'd been using <a href=\"https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one\">AIO</a> and hated it. I didn't want 2/3 of the features but disabling them broke things so I ended up maintaining a stack that was way heavier and more complicated than I needed it to be. When I found the minimal FPM implementation I was ecstatic and immediately began switching to it (it didn't help that my Nextcloud was down at the time because of another update migration failure). I got it working locally on my workstation for testing and it was <em>fast</em>! Like blazingly, like \"this is how a webpage should work\" fast! I was over the moon! Converted the local dev stack to a production ready one, backed up my existing installation, deployed it to my cluster and... it's slow. Still faster than the old setup, but just barely. Goddammit. \"Maybe my infrastructure just isn't compatible with Nextcloud\" I think to myself, \"Maybe the computer gods have simply deemed me unworthy\". Oh well, this new setup will still make updates easier down the road so no sense in going back to AIO, so may as well complete the migration.</p>\n<p>I'm working my way through the Nextcloud post-install warnings on the overview page when I notice one I'd never seen before:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Your client has been identified as <code>&lt;ip in my nextcloud stack network&gt;</code> and has been rate limited. If this is unexpected your reverse proxy configuration may be incorrect.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Easy enough to fix. The PHP-FPM container is detecting all requests coming from the web server as originating from the same client and rate limiting them. Add the Nextcloud stack network to the <code>trusted_proxies</code> config parameter and the error goes away. Not a problem, but the little spinning beach ball in my head doesn't go away. Somethings bothering me about it, but I'm not sure what yet, so I continue with the migration. I start getting my phone hooked back up to the new server: app login goes fine, but when I try to connect DAVx to sync calendars I get \"Cannot login: [429] failed\". 429 is Too Many Requests. Lightbulb.</p>\n<p>At the debug level of the Nginx logs for the Nextcloud stack web server I find my smoking gun:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Client <code>&lt;ip of my core reverse proxy&gt;</code> is rate limited</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I add the IP of the <em>core</em> reverse proxy to the <code>trusted_proxies</code> config parameter, restart Nextcloud, and... it's fast! Like really fast! Like literally faster than I have ever personally seen Nextcloud run, ever, in my life! For the first time I am experiencing the Nextcloud I've heard people talk so highly of but had never actually used! Because I had configured <code>trusted_proxies</code> and the request seemed to be coming from outside the local (Nextcloud stack) network Nextcloud itself detected the IP of my core reverse proxy as an external IP and so didn't give me the \"your reverse proxy config may be wrong\" error. But because it was treating the core reverse proxy as an external client all requests from two laptops, a desktop, and a phone appeared to be coming from a single source and so got throttled to hell and back. I'm not sure if this was the same issue I was having under AIO, but it's very possible. </p>\n<p>Either way, I'm glad to now be running a stable, updatable, minimal, and <em>correctly configured</em> version of Nextcloud.</p>\n<p>TL;DR: I hated Nextcloud for 3 years because it was painfully slow, not realizing that a quirk of my lab setup was causing all clients to get lumped into a single rate-limit bucket. Correctly identifying my lab's reverse proxy to Nextcloud solved the issue and it's now a solid core to my lab services.</p>",

That goes way too far.  No other datacenter company requires this. </p>\n<p>Here is the relevant section from Vultr's new TOS:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>information, text, opinions, messages, comments, audio visual works, motion pictures, photographs, animation, videos, graphics, sounds, music, software, Apps, and any other content or material that You or your end users submit, upload, post, host, store, or otherwise make available (\u201cMake Available\u201d) on or through the <strong>Services</strong> (collectively, \u201cYour Content,\u201d \u201cContent\u201d or \u201cUser Content\u201d).</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>You hereby grant to Vultr a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide license (including the right to sublicense through multiple tiers) to use, reproduce, process, adapt, publicly perform, publicly display, modify, prepare derivative works, publish, transmit and distribute each of your User Content, or any portion thereof, in any form, medium or distribution method now known or hereafter existing, known or developed, and otherwise use and <strong>commercialize the User Content in any way that Vultr deems appropriate, without any further consent, notice and/or compensation to you</strong> or to any third parties, for purposes of providing the Services to you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is NOT standard contract language for web services.  I don't know of anywhere else that requires this.</p>\n<p>For comparison, Digital Ocean specifically limits this clause to uploads on their website (ie, for community articles, forum posts, etc), not for all hosted services (which would include virtual machines, databases, etc).  Additionally, commercialization rights are not granted and it is not perpetual:</p>\n<p>Digital Ocean TOS Excerpt:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We will periodically differentiate between our websites such as digitalocean.com (which we will refer to collectively as the \u201cWebsites\u201d) and all of our other services, such as our cloud infrastructure and other paid services (which we will refer to collectively as the \u201cServices\u201d).</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>By providing your User Content to or via the <strong>Websites</strong>, you grant DigitalOcean a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully paid right and license (with the right to sublicense) to host, store, transfer, display, perform, reproduce, modify for the purpose of formatting for display, and distribute your User Content, in whole or in part, in any media formats and through any media channels.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Though requesting limited permissions for the purposes of user uploads on a forum or other community site is fairly standard, it is not reasonable for a service provider partner to require full, irrevocable commercial rights of anything hosted on their services.  That'd let Vultr take and monetize customer databases, apps, software, etc. which almost every business and personal user would likely find objectionable.  Vultr needs to restrict their request as is done elsewhere in the industry.</p>\n<p>Here is another example -- AWS does not have such broad terms, except for their generative AI product:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>50.12.7. PartyRock Apps. \u201cPartyRock App\u201d means any application created or remixed through PartyRock, including any app snapshot and all corresponding source code. By creating or remixing a PartyRock App, you hereby grant: (a) AWS and its affiliates a worldwide, non-exclusive, fully paid-up, royalty-free license to access, reproduce, prepare derivative works based upon, transmit, display, perform and otherwise exploit your PartyRock App in connection with PartyRock; and (b) anyone who accesses your PartyRock App (\u201cPartyRock Users\u201d), a non-exclusive license to access, reproduce, export, use, prepare derivative works based upon, transmit, and otherwise exploit your PartyRock App for any personal purpose. We may reject, remove, or disable your PartyRock App, PartyRock alias, or PartyRock account at any time for any reason with or without notice to you. You are responsible for your PartyRock Apps, PartyRock Data, and use of your PartyRock Apps, including compliance with the Policies as defined in the Agreement and applicable law. Except as provided in this Section 50.12, we obtain no rights under the Agreement to PartyRock Data or PartyRock Apps. Neither AWS, its Affiliates, nor PartyRock Users have any obligations to make any payments to you in connection with your PartyRock Apps. You will defend and indemnify AWS and its Affiliates for any and all damages, liabilities, penalties, fines, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees) arising out of or in any way related to Your PartyRock Apps or your use of PartyRock. Do not include personally identifying, confidential, or sensitive information in the input that you provide to create or use a PartyRock App.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Note how the license grant doesn't infect the rest of AWS offerings, but is only restricted to their AI product offering \"PartyRock\".  </p>\n<p>It's possible Vultr may want the expansive license grant in order to do AI/Machine Learning based on the data they host.  Or maybe they could mine database contents to resell PII.  Given the (perpetual!) license, there's not really any limit to what they might do.  They could even clone someone's app and sell their own rebranded version, and they'd be legally in the clear.</p>\n<p>I sent my objection to Vultr support, but I've just been getting the run around so far.  I've been trying to get them to at least let me access my account without agreeing to the new TOS so I can migrate out to another provider, but I'm now on day 5 of being locked out with no end in sight.  Migrating all my servers and DNS without being able to login to my account is going to be both a headache and error prone.  I feel like they're holding my business hostage and extorting me into accepting a license I would never consent to under duress.  I'm self employed and the product I host (currently) on Vultr is what pays my rent, so not being able to manage it is a pretty serious concern for me.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I don't know what Vultr's plans are, but I think it's definitely worth pushing back on this overly expansive license grant they're giving to themselves.  If Vultr gets away with it, other cloud providers may try to sneak it into their contracts, too</p>",

The last time we had one was in December, right around the holidays. I hope everyone is doing well and enjoying the early Spring weather.</p>\n<p>It has been a whirlwind of changes to Immich over the past three, almost four months. We pushed out new features and made several breaking changes to bring you the best search experience in the self-hosted photo management space. Yes, we changed our tagline from <strong>backup solution</strong> to <strong>photo and video management solution</strong>.</p>\n<p>Immich has grown exponentially and done more than what the original scopes I had in mind when starting the project, with many contributions from existing and new contributors. The application has improved in all aspects, from adding new features, bug fixing, and refactoring to keep the code base clean to refining our CI/CD pipeline so that the developers get the best feedback when writing code to quickly implement their ideas and the features they want. Immich gets to this point because of the supportive community and the fantastic team behind it; thank you!</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/zdd9ryx8owpc1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=561acfd809d2720d51876f185909a69da0c026fa\">New logo</a></p>\n<p>And yes, we also have a new logo and not-so-ComicSans font to pair with it. I hope you guys like it. Thanks, Matt, again, for the fantastic design.</p>\n<p>Besides the new logo, what else have we done over the last four months? Let's hit on some notable changes from newest to oldest.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We introduced the drag-to-select mechanism on the mobile app to quickly select assets in bulk</li>\n<li>We added OpenTelemetry integration so that you can connect your Prometheus and Grafana dashboards to monitor your instance's performance. To clarify, all of these metrics stay local on your machine.</li>\n<li>We spent much time optimizing library scanning and database query performance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/kckyenucowpc1.png?width=1086&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83f883461436c8578cbfbb49cae005cda058e125\">Enhanced search filters</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>We added a new search filter on the web to search the combination of file name/file extension or semantic/contextual with people, location, camera type, and date range with the various display options. The speed of searching paid off nicely, with the trade-off of the inconvenience of breaking changes. And now the search result isn't limited to 100; we himplemented infinite scroll on those views.</li>\n<li>We implemented a more advanced facial recognition algorithm called DBSCAN. To better understand DBSCAN's work, please watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDZUdRSDOok\">this video</a> for a step-by-step visualization.</li>\n<li>We switched our license from <a href=\"https://github.com/immich-app/immich/discussions/7023\">MIT to AGPLv3</a> with no CLA to ensure the freeness of Immich forever.</li>\n<li>Optimizing rendering and caching on the mobile app so that the browsing and viewing experience is as satisfying as possible.</li>\n<li>You can now specify storage quota for users on your instance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Those are the changes you can easily see; besides that, almost a thousand other contributions further polish the backend and other QoL improvements across the application.</p>\n<p>Some fun metrics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A whooping 293 contributors have contributed code to the project over the past two years</li>\n<li>The Discord community has grown to 6470 members.</li>\n<li>You have sent us almost 8000 stars to gaze on GitHub since December - keep it coming!</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>A few words on breaking changes</h1>\n<p>Even though the team operates on the premises of a very active development project, we have never treated breaking changes lightly. All the breaking changes happen to make Immich better and to fulfill the feature requests that the community has put in. We can't promise that we won't have any more breaking changes in the future because we are not stable yet and are still honing Immich into a diamond of this space. We will make sure to provide you a path of least resistance to update if this to happen again.</p>\n<p>And, yes, you can blame me for the version number. I was a noob (maybe still a noob\ud83d\ude05 ).</p>\n<p>One thing I can promise, though, is that we have a lot of exciting things on the horizon. Let's peek into my list of goals for this year.</p>\n<h1>What is on Alex's list</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Advanced search on the mobile app</li>\n<li>Sub/nested album</li>\n<li>Smart album</li>\n<li>Locked/secured album</li>\n<li>Slideshow on the mobile app</li>\n<li>Perceptual hash search for image similarity grouping</li>\n<li>Automate mobile app deployment pipeline</li>\n<li>Multi-user switcher</li>\n<li>Dynamic time-bucket grouping based on the number of assets in the bucket</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That is not an exhaustive list, and each contributor has their own exciting list. So, I am very excited to see where Immich will be in another year.</p>\n<p>I want to express my deepest gratitude to all the contributors, the core team members, again. I couldn't have done this without you all!</p>\n<p>Thank you and please support the project, with bug reports, discussion, testing and donation.</p>\n<p>Until next time, Alex</p>\n<p>Cheers!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://discord.gg/D8JsnBEuKb\">Discord community</a></p>",

But as you can imagine, I'd like to have access to some services, like Jellyfin or Zabbix from outside, not only from my own network.</p>\n<p>This guide is the result of me searching for the best and most secure solution to that problem. It's not THE BEST, it's not THE MOST SECURE, as always you should use your own head and judgement. But I think for non-critical applications, such as self-hosted Zabbix should be more than fine.</p>\n<p>What will be used here is Cloudflare Zero Trust, which is available for free on Cloudflare account. Note - I know for sure this works if you have domain registered via CF, not sure and no way to check if it's possible with different registrators. </p>\n<p><strong>So first things first - what it is and how it works?</strong> <br />\nI'll explain only bits important for this guide. So we will use Zero Trust Tunnel and Zero Trust Application Access.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Zero Trust Tunnel is essentially a site-to-site VPN between your network and Cloudflare Zero Trust servers. It enables CF to access your resources via local IP address, resolve them and assign them its own public IP. It takes your local IP addresses, creates a CNAME for your domain, then routes all traffic via CF public IPv4 and IPv6 addresses via their proxy to your designated local IPv4 addresses. If you nslookup your hostname, you'll only get CF from their <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/ips/\">IP Ranges</a></li>\n<li>Zero Trust Application Access is a way to secure access to your applications, essentially enforcing going through loops and hoops on CF-hosted authentication page, before you can access even the login screen of your service</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Let's setup a Tunnel</strong><br />\nThe way ZT Tunnel is set up is, you go from your Dashboard to Zero Trust -&gt; Networks -&gt; Tunnels. Here you can find a detailed instruction on how to install and connect <em>cloudflared</em> daemon, that acts as a connector and gateway to your home network. If you use virtualization, like Proxmox, I recommend setting up a small VM/CT, to act as your connector.<br />\nOnce this is set up you Configure it and add <strong>Public Hostname</strong>. Here you can add local IP addresses of your services. And here are some caveats:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You want to select HTTP, not HTTPS. Cloudflare Zero Trust adds its own SSL/TLS reverse proxy, so in the end your services are behind HTTPS. If you have ONLY HTTPS (like with Proxmox) you want to select HTTPS, and in TLS settings enable \"No TLS Verify\" and \"HTTP2 connection\".</li>\n<li>You HAVE to change default port from 80 to something else. For some reason, if your service is hosted on port 80, CF doesn't add it own SSL/TLS (eg. PiHole, where you can easly change it to something like 8100).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now you can access your services from outside with hostnames you set up, but it's still not very secure - if you can access them, everyone can access them. And yes, if you're using a strong, complicated, random password the risk is minimized, but there are still exploits one can use. So let's fortify them further.</p>\n<p><strong>Cloudflare Zero Trust Access - suprisingly strong tool</strong></p>\n<p>Now what Access is I already explained. But what I didn't specify, how powerful it actually is. When you set it up and type in your service URL, you get redirected to <a href=\"https://cloudflareaccess.com\">cloudflareaccess.com</a> domain, requiring you to authenticate. By default you have only access to OTP authentication via e-mail - you type in your email, are sent an access OTP, and only when you type it in, you get access for several minutes/hours/days. However, with ZT Access you have at least for or five levels of authentication:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You can set up multiple authentication methods: OTP, login via numerous sites (Facebook, GitHub, LinkedIn), OAuth2 (Google, Azure, Google Workspaces), OneLogin, OpenID, with timeout spanning from 1 minute to 1 month</li>\n<li>You can restrict who can use these authentication methods, based on their e-mail addess, geolocation, IP range, service token</li>\n<li>You can require user to state a justification on why they want to access the service, with manual review and accept</li>\n<li>You can require using WARP (Cloudflare's own \"sort of VPN\", available at <a href=\"https://1.1.1.1\">1.1.1.1</a>) to even access these authentication methods, and can also be connected with policies and restrictions from point 2</li>\n<li>You can set up multiple WARP client restrictions, like does the user have encrypted hard drive, does it have a particular file, with particular name in specified location on their PC, does the user use WARP as is, or is logged in to your Zero Trust organization</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So you can essentially set up something like \"to access my zabbix, you have to have WARP enabled and logged in into organization, have encrypted hard drive, be located in Germany, your e-mail has to be on <a href=\"https://foo.bar\">foo.bar</a>, and you have to have this picture of a monkey named gibaccess.png on your desktop, then and only then, you can ask me, with proper justification to use your GitHub account to authenticate your access, but only for 1 hour\". Suffice to say... it's powerful.</p>\n<p>Buuuuut for our purpose I think OTP with restriction to only allow a single email address recieve the code will be more than enough. I will not describe the full process, if you self-host you're smart enough to understand what's going on. The most important - you want to create a new Application, select <strong>self-hosted</strong>, add domains from your Tunnel Public Hostnames, and set up policies - bare minimum is <strong><em>Include - Everyone, Require - Emails - your email only</em></strong><em>.</em> <br />\nOnce you set up Application, you have to go back to Tunnels, and reconfigure each Hostname, enabling Access and selecting Application you just created. </p>\n<p>And now when you type in your service URL you'll be thrown into Cloudflare Access page, requiring to type in your email. You can type any email, but if you configured policy correctly, the code will only be sent if you provide your email. It'll take any other email, but won't send code.</p>\n<p><strong>That's all, hope you like it, and have fun using it :)</strong> </p>",

Also being released today is the new, Docker-first <a href=\"https://cardinalapps.io/cardinal-home-server\">Cardinal Home Server</a>, which runs the Photos app, and also runs the upcoming <a href=\"https://cardinalapps.io/cardinal-music\">Music</a> and <a href=\"https://cardinalapps.io/cardinal-cinema\">Cinema</a> apps.</p>\n<p>Work is moving quickly on the platform now that a solid architecture is in place. All of my previous announcements for Cardinal had been for experimental apps, but not this time. What's available today is stable and comes with long term support.</p>\n<p>Download it for free directly on <a href=\"https://hub.docker.com/r/cardinalapps/home-server\">Docker Hub</a>, and check out the website at <a href=\"https://cardinalapps.io\">cardinalapps.io</a> for more info on the platform.

UnRaid's community apps made this whole process much less painful than it otherwise would've been. I was surprised at just how many cloud services I was relying on, so here is how I went about replacing as many of them as I could with FOSS.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Amazon Kindle</strong> - <a href=\"https://github.com/Kareadita/Kavita\">Kavita</a>. <a href=\"https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web\">Calibre-Web</a> was a strong contender here, and still is, but Kavita was fairly painless to setup and use, once I got used to the file structure it requires. It's broad support for different kinds of ebooks, manga, and comics, including PDF style books, won me over quick.</li>\n<li><strong>Google Podcasts</strong> - <a href=\"https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf\">AudioBookShelf</a>. Downloaded images and metadata for my podcasts as well as the automatic downloads I was used to, and has a nice Android app which I've put to good use. Everything worked so well out of the box I didn't bother to research alternatives.</li>\n<li>Audible - Also AudioBookshelf.</li>\n<li><strong>ChatGPT</strong> - <a href=\"https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama\">Ollama</a>. Wonderfully slick UI and easy install, the Ollama UNRAID package ended up seemingly being both lighter and faster than the OobaBooga install I was used to, and it nicely emulates the ChatGPT style interface, allowing you to send images to it for models that support it. OllamaHub even appears to be working to replace custom GPTs.</li>\n<li><strong>Google Drive</strong> - <a href=\"https://github.com/nextcloud/\">NextCloud</a>. Seemed a bit finicky at first, but not entirely their fault. The reverse proxy I had caused errors on larger files, and manually configuring a larger max temp file size finally allowed me to drop in large files as I was used to. Office app integration was a landmine field of suffering, including known performance issues just for having them installed. Ultimately I decided it wasn't worth it, and instead opted for a local LibreOffice install which was synced to the server with NextCloud Files.</li>\n<li><strong>Google Tasks</strong> - Next Cloud Tasks. Not a big task user. Simple was fine.</li>\n<li><strong>Google Photos</strong> - NextCloud again. Worked as a drop in replacement for my purposes. I used the Android app to configure sync on my phone's photos folder and set it to automatically upload over WiFi. The Android Photos app is paid, so instead I still use the google photos app, but with their cloud sync disabled, so nothing is uploaded. Simplistic but does the trick. I strongly considered <a href=\"https://github.com/immich-app/immich\">Immich</a>, but it is reportedly still undergoing rapid development and I wanted something more stable.</li>\n<li><strong>Google Home</strong> - <a href=\"https://github.com/home-assistant\">HomeAssistant</a>. I'm setting up my IoT devices on their own separate VLAN, with all Zigbee devices. I've installed HomeAssistant on a VM instead of a docker because it's easier to manage that way.</li>\n<li><strong>Google Keep</strong> - <a href=\"https://github.com/nextcloud/notes\">NextCloud Notes</a>. Very lightweight, simple note taking app. It supports a nice grid layout too for the full Keep experience as well, and works great for quick reminders, like my grocery list. Most note taking apps seem to use markdown under the hood, so a lot of them are functionally very similar.</li>\n<li><strong>OneNote</strong> - <a href=\"https://github.com/laurent22/joplin\">Joplin</a>. For anything more elaborate, note taking with Joplin worked very well with it's built in rich text editor, and I found it very tweakable with many plugins and extension options for formatting. I highly recommend getting <a href=\"https://github.com/JackGruber/joplin-plugin-backup/\">Simple Backup</a>. What won me over was the ease with which I could copy and paste images into it and have them display on the Android app. I considered Obsidian however I didn't want to pay for sync with a nice free option available instead. Organization similar to OneNote was also very possible with multiple nested notebooks.</li>\n<li><strong>iDrive</strong> - <a href=\"https://github.com/gilbertchen/duplicacy\">Duplicacy</a>. I strongly considered <a href=\"https://github.com/kopia/kopia\">Kopia</a> and Duplicati at first, but Kopia's immaturity as a project and the frequent horror stories I read about Dupliacti led me to Dupliacy. The GUI isn't FOSS but the command line was, and I really appreciated this solution's ability to deduplicate files and cope with my frequent file reorganization without creating needless duplicates inflating my backup size. New revisions take up minimal storage space, and an encrypted repo hosted on Black Blaze B2 provides disaster resilience. I'm also using <a href=\"https://github.com/drakkan/sftpgo\">SFTPGo</a> to securely sync a desktop to the server repo as well.</li>\n<li><strong>LastPass</strong> - <a href=\"https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden\">VaultWarden</a>. The great thing about VaultWarden is you can still use all the great Android and browser apps from BitWarden, but self hosted. Field detection seemed even better than in LastPass, and I was able to migrate everything over without too much trouble, removing many duplicates because VaultWarden supports multiple URI entries and detection schemes.</li>\n<li><strong>Netflix</strong> - <a href=\"https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin\">Jellyfin</a>. I chose Jellyfin over Plex because of the recent controversy surrounding them, and I haven't regretted it. Android and Roku based apps allowed me to use it as a drop in replacement fairly easily, and the range of metadata collection plugins and options allowed me to nicely display my entire diverse library. There's an ecosystem springing up around it with apps like <a href=\"https://github.com/Fallenbagel/jellyseerr\">JellySeerr</a> to make it increasingly competitive as well compared to Plex.</li>\n<li><strong>Amazon Music</strong> - Also Jellyfin, surprisingly. It provides options for instant mixes and selections by genre, album, etc. Some work with <a href=\"https://picard.musicbrainz.org/\">Music Brainz Picard</a> and I began to actually listen to my old music collection again.</li>\n<li><strong>Mint</strong> - <a href=\"https://github.com/firefly-iii/firefly-iii\">Firefly III</a>. I love the graphs on this app and the broad display of information. Also very configurable with rules and webhooks. The <a href=\"https://github.com/firefly-iii/data-importer\">data import tool</a> supports configurable CSV import as well which made getting everything setup easier when I had different formats from different cards. I considered <a href=\"https://github.com/actualbudget/actual\">Actual</a>, which is much more lightweight, but also has fewer features.</li>\n<li><strong>Feedly</strong> - <a href=\"https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS\">FreshRSS</a>. Nicely configurable with plugins and options, I was even able to use <a href=\"https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub\">RSSHub</a> for custom RSS feeds as well to replace some old bookmarks I occasionally monitored.</li>\n<li><strong>PushBullet</strong> - <a href=\"https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy\">Ntfy</a>. I use it to pass links or other info to my phone, occasionally, or just small files I might want if I don't feel like uploading them. On top of being useful as an alert tool if something goes wrong.</li>\n<li><strong>Youtube</strong> - <a href=\"https://github.com/Tzahi12345/YoutubeDL-Material\">YoutubeDL Material</a>. I was able to configure it to automatically download my Youtube Subscriptions, and then using the <a href=\"https://github.com/ankenyr/jellyfin-youtube-metadata-plugin\">JellyFin Youtube MetaData Plugin</a>, label it nicely, rename the file, and prepare it for display on Jellyfin. It also has a browser add-in which allows quickly passing a link to the server instance for downloading videos or just mp3s from a wide variety of sources automatically, which I've also pathed to folders Jellyfin monitors.</li>\n</ul>",

As many of us, I started small. Spawning a first home dashboard and then getting my hands dirty with Docker, Proxmox, DNS, reverse proxying etc. My first hardware was a Raspberry Pi 3. Good times!</p>\n<p>As of today, I am running various dockerized services in my homelab (50+). I have tried K3S but still rock Docker Compose productively and expose everything using Traefik. As the services keep growing and so my `docker-compose.yml` files, I fairly quickly started pushing my configs in a private Gitea repository.</p>\n<p>After a while, I noticed that friends and colleagues constantly reach out to me asking how I run this and that. So as you can imagine, I was quite busy handing over my compose examples as well as cleaning them up for sharing. Especially for those things that are not well documented by the FOSS maintainers itself. As those requests wen't havoc, I started cleaning up my private git repo and creating a public one. For me, for you, for all of us.</p>\n<p>I am sure many of you are aware of the Awesome-Selfhosted repository. It is often referenced in posts and comments as it contains various references to brilliant FOSS, which we all love to host. Today I aligned the readme of my public repo to the awesome-selhosted one. So it should be fairly easy to find stuff as it contains a table of content now.</p>\n<p>Here is the repo with 131 examples and over 3600 stars: </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Haxxnet/Compose-Examples\">https://github.com/Haxxnet/Compose-Examples</a></p>\n<p><strong>Frequently Asked Questions:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>How do you ensure that the provided compose examples are up-to-date?</em></li>\n<li>Many compose examples are run productively by myself. So if there is a major release or breaking code change, I will notice it by myself and update the repo accordingly. For everything else, I try to keep an eye on breaking changes. Sorry for any deprecated ones! If you as the community recognize a problem, please file a GitHub issue. I will then start fixing.</li>\n<li>A GitHub Action also validates each compose yml to ensure the syntax is correct. Therefore, less human error possible when crafting or copy-pasting such examples into the git repo.</li>\n<li><em>I've looked over the repo but cannot find X or Y.</em></li>\n<li>Sorry about that. The repo mostly contains examples I personally run or have run myself. A few of them are contributions from the community. May check out the repo of the maintainer and see whether a compose it provided. If not, create a GitHub issue at my repo and request an example. If you have a working example, feel free to provide it (see next FAQ point though).</li>\n<li><em>How do you select apps to include in your repository?</em></li>\n<li>The initial task was to include all compose examples I personally run. Then I added FOSS software that do not provide a compose example or are quite complex to define/structure/combine. In general, I want to refrain from adding things that are well documented by the maintainers itself. So if you can easily find a docker compose example at the maintainer's repo or public documentation, my repo will likely not add it if currently missing.</li>\n<li><em>What does the compose volume definition `${DOCKER_VOLUME_STORAGE:-/mnt/docker-volumes}` mean?</em></li>\n<li>This is a specific type of <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/compose/environment-variables/env-file/#interpolation\">environment variable definition</a>. It basically searches for a `<em>DOCKER_VOLUME_STORAGE</em>` environment variable on your Docker server. If it is not set, the bind volume mount path with fall-back to the path `/mnt/docker-volumes`. Otherwise, it will use the path set in the environment variable. We do this for many compose examples to have a unified place to store our persisted docker volume data. I personally have all data stored at `/mnt/docker-volumes/<container-stack-name>`. If you don't like this path, just set the env variable to your custom path and it will be overridden.</li>\n<li><em>Why do you store the volume data separate from the compose yaml files?</em></li>\n<li>I personally prefer to separate things. By adhering to separate paths, I can easily push my compose files in a private git repository. By using `git-crypt`, I can easily encrypt `.env` files with my secrets without exposing them in the git repo. As the docker volume data is at a separate Linux file path, there is no chance I accidentially commit those into my repo. On the other side, I have all volume data at one place. Can be easily backed up by Duplicati for example, as all container data is available at `/mnt/docker-volumes/`.</li>\n<li><em>Why do you put secrets in the compose file itself and not in a separate `.env`?</em></li>\n<li>The repo contains examples! So feel free to harden your environment and separate secrets in an env file or platform for secrets management. The examples are scoped for beginners and intermediates. Please harden your infrastructure and environment.</li>\n<li><em>Do you recommend Traefik over Caddy or Nginx Proxy Manager?</em></li>\n<li>Yes, always! Traefik is cloud native and explicitely designed for dockerized environments. Due to its labels it is very easy to expose stuff. Furthermore, we proceed in infrastructure as code, as you just need to define some labels in a `docker-compose.yml` file to expose a new service. I started by using Nginx Proxy Manager but quickly switched to Traefik.</li>\n<li><em>What services do you run in your homelab?</em></li>\n<li>Too many likely. Basically a good subset of those in the public GitHub repo. If you want specifics, ask in the comments.</li>\n<li><em>What server(s) do you use in your homelab?</em></li>\n<li>I opted for a single, power efficient NUC server. It is the HM90 EliteMini by Minisform. It runs Proxmox as hypervisor, has 64GB of RAM and a virtualized TrueNAS Core VM handles the SSD ZFS pool (mirror). The idle power consumption is about 15-20 W. Runs rock solid and has enough power for multiple VMs and nearly all selfhosted apps you can imagine (except for those AI/LLMS etc.).</li>\n</ul>",
