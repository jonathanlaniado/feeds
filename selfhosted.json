            "title": "Selfhost Showoff Sunday! Here's my setup",
            "content_html": "<p>With a LOT of help and inspiration from this sub, I've gotten my selfhosted homelab into a place I really am happy with, and I wanted to show off what I've got running. Nearly all of this infrastructure is a bunch of Docker containers on a Lenovo T15 laptop running Linux Mint. I have a single \"stacks\" repo with the Docker compose configs, as well as <em>really</em> bad home-rolled shell scripts for updating of images and backing up of container configs and volumes.</p>\n<p>Below are all (I think?) of the pieces of my homelab. Would love to hear how others' Selfhost Setups are looking today!</p>\n<p>Infrastructure:\n- Nebula VPN: connects everything together, and allows me to access everything remotely. And uh I swear this is not a shill post! but disclaimer, I work at Defined Networking which provides a managed Nebula, so this is an easy setup for me personally. Otherwise Tailscale would've been a no-brainer.\n- Traefik / LetsEncrypt: everything's proxied thru Traefik and generates TLS certs with LE, using DNS verification via AWS Route53. All apps are tied to Traefik/LE using Docker compose labeling, which is great because I hate configuring Traefik and LetsEncrypt\n- Gitea: contains, among other things, my main \"stacks\" repo from which this whole setup is bootstrapped\n- Infisical: used for SSH key management/connectivity to my homelab hosts. Someday I will also use this for secrets management...\n- Pocket ID: auth I can add to non-authed apps. Exceptionally easy to setup, and works great with my YubiKey and phone biometrics\n- Beszel/Ntfy/Mattermost: monitoring/alerting of infrastructure, or \"we have Grafana/Prometheus at home\". Beszel has been a nice monitoring/alerting setup which publishes to both Ntfy (easy message routing and phone notifications) and Mattermost (easy logging)\n- Kuma Uptime: monitoring/alerting of apps/websites I care about: also publishes to Ntfy/Mattermost\n- Portainer: easy/quick at-a-glance view of my the Docker stacks. I could manage most all my Docker compose setups in here, but that's a whole other project, and would mean migrating away from my extremely bad shell scripts\n- Dockpeek: has mostly replaced my awful shell script that updates my Docker images\n- Speedtest Tracker: runs twice daily and outputs to Ntfy, mostly just fun to see how much more consistent my new internet is compared to my previous Comcast (lmao fuck Comcast)\n- AdGuard: great DNS blocking. I used to use PiHole, but I like managing AdGuard a little more\n- Syncthing: not shown, but vital to this setup: I have a Pepe Silvia web of Syncthing'd hosts, which handle all of my backups</p>\n<p>Selfhosted Things I Use A Lot:\n- Immich: I've completely migrated from Google Photos, having recently done an <code>immich-go</code> CLI import of my Google Takeout export\n- SearXNG: has completely replaced all my searching on both PC and mobile\n- Vaultwarden: has completely replaced my Bitwarden setup\n- n8n: houses my automation workflows, two main ones are my daily weather and daily news, where n8n scrapes some data, summarizes data with local AI (I'm lazy so I just use Ollama on my Windows gaming PC), and sends the daily reports to my \"Good Morning\" Mattermost channel\n- ownCloud Office/Collabora: this was a bit of a bitch to get set up, but has been a solid docs/sheets replacement\n- Karakeep: (ignore the totals, I've been mucking with my Karakeep data) excellent link saver, with local AI summarization (again, to my Ollama host)\n- Zipline: image hosting that I use mainly for the Homepage icons (for apps that are tougher to pull favicons from directly)\n- IT Tools/networking-toolbox: two excellent 'toolbox' apps that I use daily\n- jsoncrack: great json visualizer, especially for deeply-nested data\n- Grocy: we use this to catalog our chest freezer in the basement; it's sooo nice to know what we have down there at a glance\n- Homebox: where I document the things that I'd otherwise lose in our garage or basement storage\n- Memos/Beaver Habit Tracker: daily journal and habit tracking that has really assuaged my ADHD\n- Invoke/Open WebUI: for messing around with local AI. I do not have a big enough setup for this to be super super useful though :/\n- changedetection.io: great for easily keeping track of some blogs I care about, and tracking some news sites that I otherwise don't visit directly (eg HN/Slashdot)\n- MeTube: IMO the cleanest/easiest YouTube downloader\n- NocoDB: has mostly replaced the spreadsheets I was previously using as databases \ud83d\ude2c</p>\n<p>Cool Stuff I Don't Use As Much But By George I've Got It:\n- Home Assistant: I'm still in the early stages of getting our smarthome stuff set up. Don't judge\n- BentoPDF/Excalidraw: pretty cool local toolboxes\n- Netdata: very neat, granular host monitoring software, but it's a got a big footprint, and has a cloud connectivity requirement for logging in. I tried this out but Beszel mostly fulfills this\n- Proxmox: I have a physical Proxmox host (just another Lenovo laptop, heh), I just don't do much with it yet\n- HarborGuard: Docker image vulnerability scanning. Neat, but I didn't find the scans super actionable, so I don't really use it\n- Seafile: just got this after I saw others recommend it, not yet sure if it'll replace ownCloud for my filehosting\n- Slink: very slick \"we have imgur at home\", I currently only use it for the Homepage background of the Pillars of Creation</p><div><br></div><img src=\"https://i.redd.it/8dd3xctsm2wf1.png\" />",

            "title": "My Plex server has started an addiction",
            "content_html": "<p>It started about a month or two ago when I got a new OLED TV and wanted to make sure I was playing the highest quality content on it. I realized streaming services were absolutely terrible in terms of bitrate &amp; surround sound, so I got back into pirating.</p>\n<p>It started by me using my PC to run Plex, then I realized that was annoying, so I moved to my old laptop, but I quickly ran out of space there.. so I went back to the PC, added a few cheap nvme drives, and that worked fine for about a week.</p>\n<p>Then I ran out of space again, so I started buying some external HDD enclosures. I had 2 26TB HDDs running with StableBit Drivepool so I could have it as one drive. I added a third HDD so I could get parity. I realized those were slow (at least for the quick 100GB transfers of movie files/TV shows I needed) &amp; also a bad idea for safety (unplugging during writes can cause corruption). This also meant adding drives to the pool over time would not gracefully rebalance automatically. So I got a 9460i 16 raid card and began plugging the drives directly into the card (which is connected to the mobo).</p>\n<p>That was fine until one night I was working late and heard popcorn popping. I also noticed that my (fairly small) office was getting warmer than usual. It was the drives. At this point I 6 26TB HDDs that I was trying to store my media on. I couldn't deal with the sound &amp; the heat.</p>\n<p>I returned the drives, did a bunch more research, and realized I needed at least RAID6 if I was planning on having any real level of redundancy. So I purchased 4 16TB enterprise SAS SSDs off of eBay (used, but still 90-99% health left on them!!). These run quiet, cool, and are way smaller. I ran this off of my own PC for a bit but realized I hated that my torrenting VPN would cause issues with my work apps &amp; browsing. I had to decide between work or torrenting, and I do a lot of both so that got annoying quickly.</p>\n<p>What finally pushed me to get a dedicated rig was when my sister &amp; one of my friends both tried to watch something from my library at the same time and both had to transcode. They began stuttering &amp; buffering. I need great uptime because I really want this to be a dedicated reliable library of high quality ad-free movies &amp; shows.</p>\n<p>I built a custom (overkill - I might run something else on it some day) Plex PC running Windows 11 (I know, please don't kill me lol. I just wanted something that worked easily and didn't require a lot more time investment from me right now). I put a 7600X, 32GB, Arc B580, and the raid card + drives into the case and it was awesome.. for a day or two. It took me like a week of debugging to realize that it *had* to be set to PCIE3 speeds &amp; run off of a dedicated connection to the CPU (forgetting the proper name for this). Once I did that the drives stopped randomly going offline and it's been running reliably since (for about a week now). This morning I added 2 more 16TB ssds and with RAID6 I'm now at 83.7TB of drives. 55.8TB of usable capacity after 2 drive parity and 21TB of it used. One thing I could not figure out is how to wire things nicely in the N5 case with the SSDs. I managed to get 3 of them to appear in the front bottom of the case (second pic) but the other 3 are tucked in the back. There just wasn't long enough cabling to make things fit nicely in the bays, and the bays also would allow me to mount SAS, but no way to output anything beside SATA (as far as I can figure out).</p>\n<p>I know I've made a lot of mistakes and I'm probably still messing something up - but the moments where I can sit down on my couch and watch some 80Mbps 5.1/7.1 Blurays from a giant Plex library while seeing that my friends/family are doing the same make it totally worth it.</p>\n<p>I'm now looking for anyone who might be interested in helping test the rig out. I download things in the highest quality I can get and I'm constantly expanding, maybe 2-4TB of content per week. I don't have any dedicated system to request content (but you can ask me), nor can I guarantee uptime (but I'm trying to improve constantly). If you are interested in helping me test the rig out send me a DM with your Plex User/Email and I'll send you an invite. (P.S. I primarily have English audio tracks, sorry!)</p>\n<p>Happy to answer any questions or take any advice! Thanks for reading my word wall.</p>",

Consider Jellyfin.</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Full text below: \nhttps://i.imgur.com/0PMRvVY.png</p>\n<hr />\n<blockquote>\n<pre><code>Dear Plex User,\n\nWe have recently experienced a security incident that may potentially involve your Plex account information. We believe the actual impact of this incident is limited; however, action is required from you to ensure your account remains secure.\n\nWhat happened \nAn unauthorized third party accessed a limited subset of customer data from one of our databases. While we quickly contained the incident, information that was accessed included emails, usernames, and securely hashed passwords.\n\nAny account passwords that may have been accessed were securely hashed, in accordance with best practices, meaning they cannot be read by a third party. Out of an abundance of caution, we recommend you immediately reset your password by visiting https://plex.tv/reset. Rest assured that we do not store credit card data on our servers, so this information was not compromised in this incident.\n\nWhat we're doing \nWe've already addressed the method that this third party used to gain access to the system, and we're undergoing additional reviews to ensure that the security of all of our systems is further hardened to prevent future attacks.\n\nWhat you must do \nWe kindly request that you reset your Plex account password immediately by visiting https://plex.tv/reset. When doing so, there's a checkbox to \"Sign out connected devices after password change,\" which we recommend you enable. This will sign you out of all your devices (including any Plex Media Server you own) for your security, and you will then need to sign back in with your new password. We understand that this means a little more work for you, but it will provide additional security to your account.\n\nAdditional Security Measures \nYou Can Take We remind you that no one at Plex will ever reach out to you over email to ask for a password or credit card number for payments. For further account protection, we also recommend enabling two-factor authentication on your Plex account if you haven\u2019t already done so.\n\nLastly, we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this situation may cause you. We take pride in our security systems, which helped us quickly detect this incident, and we want to assure you that we are working swiftly to prevent potential future incidents from occurring.\n\nFor step-by-step instructions on how to reset your password, visit: https://support.plex.tv/articles/account-requires-password-reset\n\nThank you,\n\nThe Plex Team\n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>",

My dad is weird with tech in the sense he knows what he's talking about but also not really? He's a bit like an old man who thinks the computers are mythical beings and I need something to reassure him that hackers aren't going to get into our home cameras from my minecraft server. Which is nuts coming from a man who has only one password.</p>\n<p>I was just going to stick a whitelist on it and call it a day. That's what most people I know have done. I don't really want to spend any money, that's the whole reason I'm hosting it myself. I have looked into VLANs and ehhhhhh I don't want to fuck with those but also I can't on my router from my ISP anyway. I'm a little unsure where to go next. I don't really see much risk personally.

Sometimes he pretends to be unbiased by listing other services, but <strong>he always puts SMTPget first and hypes it up</strong>.</p>\n<p>In the past, his account made a random post in an Indian actor subreddit to seem neutral, which further confirms that he's the owner, because the SMTPget website itself has an Indian phone number.</p>\n<p>It's completely obvious he's the owner or directly part of the team.</p>\n<p><strong>SMTPget is a fake SMTP service with terrible reviews. According to all reviews, they don't deliver anything and just take your money. Their plans are all very expensive and the website is literally just a front to take money and not deliver anything!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>They don't even accept safe payments like PayPal or credit cards. They ONLY accept GIFT CARDS and Crypto. Very fitting for an Indian scammer indeed. \ud83e\udd23</strong></p>\n<p>Here's the Trustpilot page (<strong>EVERY REVIEW</strong> is 1-star explaining how his scam works, where people have lost $180, $1000 etc when they thought they bought a large capacity bulk mailing service but got nothing at all; there's only two fake 5-star reviews from Indian usernames):</p>\n<p>\ud83d\udc49 <a href=\"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/smtpget.com\">https://www.trustpilot.com/review/smtpget.com</a></p>\n<p>And here's another huge warning on Sitejabber:</p>\n<p>\ud83d\udc49 <a href=\"https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/smtpget.com\">https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/smtpget.com</a></p>\n<p>I've blocked him and reported him to the mods. His entire posting history is just pushing SMTPget. He adds no value to the community and <strong>should be banned, and his post history in selfhosted should be deleted to protect people.</strong></p>\n<p>My second reason for making this post is to give him some nice Google SEO results to perhaps warn some future victims.</p>",

B. No proper metadata yet. (details here:https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1l9jlhm/update_35_spotify_open_source_sonos_alternative/)</p>\n<p>Airplay1 &amp; 2: MacOs/iOS\nI added a second Airplay stream to the tutorial. What is pretty nice, is that things like youtube, tidal and all the stuff is working using airplay.\nBut also here: metadata is sometimes not standardized. I guess i will have to look into how snapcast handles the streams and maybe map some lost metadata, anyone experience with this?</p>\n<p>Stream Components\nAdded some components in the app to manage streams. (see picture 3)</p>\n<p>You can find the updated repo here (v.0.0.2):\nhttps://github.com/byrdsandbytes/snapcast-pi</p>\n<p>Thanks to the wonderful people, that say annoying things like, \u201eI am still utterly confused as to what is snapcast pi and what ist beatnik.\u201c, i have to think about, explain &amp; name things. So i made a graph. (First pic). What do you think? Does that help?</p>\n<p>Next steps are going to clean up the messy web app and make a first release. Any suggestions which license? (GPLv3, AGPLv3, or go full anarchy with MIT?)</p>\n<p>Note: the first release is not gone be well documented, full of bugs &amp; therefore not production ready. </p>\n<p>Thanks for asking questions &amp; staring on github.

            "content_html": "<p>Hey everyone,</p>\n<p>I wanted to bring attention to a project called DUO \u2014 it\u2019s a fork of Sunshine that adds multiseat gaming features. Honestly, the concept is super cool, and I was really excited to use it and potentially contribute.</p>\n<p>But after looking into it, I realized the developer is putting key features behind a paywall (via Patreon) and has only released partial source code, saying \u201cthe open source parts\u201d are available \u2014 while keeping the rest closed.</p>\n<p>Since Sunshine is licensed under the GPLv3, this is very likely a license violation. The GPL requires that if you modify or build on a GPL-licensed project and distribute it (even behind a paywall), you must also release all of the modified code under the same GPL license.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve opened an issue on the DUO GitHub repo explaining this in detail and citing sources from the Free Software Foundation and the license itself:\n\ud83d\udc49 <a href=\"https://github.com/DuoStream/Duo/issues/294\">Here\u2019s the GitHub issue I filed</a></p>\n<p>I\u2019m not trying to attack the dev here \u2014 I know maintaining projects is hard work, and DUO clearly took effort. But I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s right to build on open source work and then close off large parts of the result. That\u2019s not how open source works, and it goes against the license that allowed this kind of innovation in the first place.</p>\n<p>If anyone else is concerned or can offer insight (especially if you\u2019ve dealt with GPL enforcement before), feel free to chime in on the issue or raise visibility. Hopefully with enough attention the developer will bring the project into compliance.</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>",

And the best part, they don't offer month-to-moth subscription options, so I'd have to pay $2,409 USD! </p>\n<p>That's JUST AS BAD as a professional solution offered by any other major player in the network space!</p>\n<p>They're not the only folks doing this; Rustdesk does it too, same song and dance, no monthly options, and all of the nicer features are locked behind a paywall. Kasm also does the same with branding, and connection limits. (5 is NOT enough for small teams!)</p>\n<p>I get it you want to make some money, I really do, but companies should really explore other avenues. Wireguard gets it right, they let individuals enjoy all the features the platform has to offer, and then hope they bring it to their company.</p>\n<p>I've had to go OUT OF MY WAY to find solutions to issues like this; i.e. searching for other developers liking a product so much that they develop a custom backend by reverse engineering the original software's backend. (Great example of this is Rustdesk-API! Someone reverse engineered the backend, and built their own that works great!) <a href=\"https://github.com/lejianwen/rustdesk-api\">https://github.com/lejianwen/rustdesk-api</a></p>\n<p>The point of selfhosted is to\u00a0<strong>NOT</strong>\u00a0rely on a subscription, the idea is to host whatever it is that's being offered onsite, with no cost, and with community support. That's the r/selfhosted that I'm happy to see, play with, and learn. Whatever this mess is that's been slowly creeping up on the subreddit has really been getting out of hand.</p>\n<p>There are exclusions, we all pay the \"Plex Tax\" but I have a feeling that's about to go south based on their recent changes, and some folk pay for solutions like UNRAID or HexOS, which I get, but they're entirely paywalled, because they're complete solutions.</p>",

This is useful for organizations that want to streamline the onboarding process for new users and ensure that their user accounts are always up-to-date. You are able to programmatically decide the roles and organizations for new users based on the information provided by the identity provider</p>\n<h1>Integration API</h1>\n<p>The integration API is a well documented way to interact with and script Pangolin. It is a REST API that has support for all different operations you can do with the UI. It has easy scoped permissions so you can create keys with specific jobs. You can see the different routes here: <a href=\"https://docs.fossorial.io/Pangolin/API/integration-api\">https://docs.fossorial.io/Pangolin/API/integration-api</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/5wvflhb1ik0f1.png?width=4544&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce65dac749a5c3436a7e2ffbaa0de38db204357c\">Swagger UI docs for Pangolin Integration API.</a></p>\n<h1>Dual License Model</h1>\n<p>Pangolin is dual licensed under AGPL-3.0 and the Fossorial Commercial License. Both the \u201cCommunity Edition\u201d and \u201cProfessional Edition\u201d will have feature parity. The supporter program is for individual enthusiasts, tinkerers, and homelabbers. This won't go away and we don't expect supporters to go Professional. The Professional Edition will remain - but for businesses who need our support and more flexibility. We expect businesses to pay for a version of Pangolin. We may adjust the pricing as we learn more about what companies want.</p>\n<p>Monetizing is new territory for us, and we are learning as we go. We appreciate your patience and we hope that this is a better approach for our community.</p>",

And a special thank you to those who have supported the project financially through the Supporter Program.</p>\n<p>We also want to share that we\u2019ve introduced a new Professional Edition license.

Since the legal process is still unresolved, I\u2019ll have to save the full story for another time. For now, I\u2019ve decided that the best path forward is to rebrand.</p>\n<p>Starting today, Hoarder is rebranding to Karakeep! </p>\n<p>The name Karakeep is inspired by the Arabic word \"\u0643\u0631\u0627\u0643\u064a\u0628\" (karakeeb), a colloquial term commonly used to refer to miscellaneous clutter, odds and ends, or items that may seem disorganized but often hold personal value or hidden usefulness. It evokes the image of a messy drawer or forgotten box, full of stuff you can't quite throw away\u2014because somehow, it matters (or more likely, because you're a hoarder!).</p>\n<p>Over the next couple of weeks, things will start getting renamed to Karakeep (the repo, apps, extensions, etc). <a href=\"https://hoarder.app\">hoarder.app</a> will soon also begin redirecting to our new domain: <a href=\"https://karakeep.app\">karakeep.app</a>.</p>\n<p>I took pride in coming up with \"hoarder\" as the name for the project. I've spent months searching for a different name, but nothing felt as good as hoarder was. But it's time to move on. I'm incredibly grateful for the support this community has shown throughout the whole thing. Hopefully, I can now focus my time and energy on what matters: building Karakeep.</p>\n<p>It goes without saying, but please refrain from contacting the other party in any way, shape, or form.</p>",

Today I just setup my first Ubuntu server where I am currently hosting Plex, Homeassistant, Kuma,  and a few others. I successfully completed the migration over from Windows with no hiccups. Even managed to transfer 50TB of media with no losses. I have big plans for the future, and wouldn\u2019t be able to do any of it without this sub and the help you all have offered. This dashboard I created is optimized for mobile devices, so that\u2019s why the spacing may seem off.</p>\n<p>P.S.

I spend my entire day working with containerised applications, and what do I find when I load up Reddit? Ansible playbook writing maniacs trying to automate their light switches. You are all a bunch of sick freaks who probably dream in YAML and wake up in cold sweats wondering if you forgot to enable that cron job</p>\n<p>The worst part is how you enable each other. \"Hey guys, just finished my basic home automation setup\", and then you post a system diagram that looks like the blueprint for a nuclear reactor. Fourteen Docker containers just to manage a suite of 'internet of things connected shitware. You celebrate each others descent into madness with vomit inducing comments like \"Nice setup! Have you considered adding Prometheus monitoring?\" You are all a bunch of sick freaks, you make me ill.</p>\n<p>And the money you guys must spaff away... you've somehow convinced yourself that spending thousands on enterprise server equipment from 2012 is justified as it was originally 10x the cost. And then you refer to it as \u201cyour little setup\". \"Oh this? Just my Dual mirrored RAID 10 arrays with triple redundant UPS and backup diesel generator that kicks in if the power flickrs for more than 3 milliseconds. You know, for my Linux ISO collection\" Meanwhile your electricity meter spins so fast it could probably generate its own electricity. You are all a bunch of sick freaks, and you need help.</p>\n<p>I take solace in imagining what your home lives are like, I laugh as I imagine your families, having to sit through dinner listening to you explain why running Pi-hole with Unbound is superior to forwarding to Cloudflare. I bet your kids start crying when you mention DNS-over-HTTPS. Your wife just stares at you now, especially since you've replaced all your family photos with Grafana dashboards.</p>\n<p>I imagine you boiling over when when the women you made vows to asks \"why can\u2019t we just go back to using iCloud\" when your precious self-hosted photo library goes down during your third Photoprism upgrade this week. They completely ignore your \u2018impressive\u2019 (97% lol) uptime statistics and offsite backups. You are all a bunch of sick freaks, and your loved ones are losing hope.</p>\n<p>No, you don't need Kubernetes or 10gig network switches or 7u rack. You don't need any of these increasingly abstract layers of complexity that exist only to solve the problems created by your previous solutions. Your simple file server didn't need containers, those containers didn't need orchestration, that orchestration didn't need a service mesh, Yet here you are, staring at 10,000 lines of YAML, wondering if maybe just one more helm chart would finally make it all perfect. But I know you'll keep adding more, because you're all just a bunch of sick freaks.</p>",

I use OpenLiteSpeed to serve the actual website itself. </p>\n<p>The site communicates to a backend flask server that runs locally on the machine and processes all the necessary information the site needs to function, including the notification features. This is then proxied through OpenLiteSpeed to avoid any CORS errors. </p>\n<p>My router is running OpenWRT with Cloudflare Zero Trust installed. This allows me to route my domain to the local ip of my server without ever port forwarding or revealing my local network in any meaningful way. </p>\n<p>OpenLiteSpeed actually functions as a reverse proxy, I host my portfolio off of the same server and OpenLiteSpeed routes traffic based off of the domain. </p>\n<p>I wouldn\u2019t recommend this unless you really enjoy tinkering with this stuff because it can be a pain and it\u2019s probably cheaper to use a reputable hosting service, especially when counting setup and maintenance hours. </p>\n<p>I\u2019ll answer any questions you all have! </p>\n<p>The two sites mentioned:\nhttps://potustracker.us\nhttps://lukewin.es (my portfolio) </p><div><br></div><img src=\"https://i.redd.it/j4l5fxu65afe1.jpeg\" />",

After reaching 350+ sets in my collection and now helping my son manage his own LEGO journey, I found that Brickset, Rebrickable, BaseBrick, Peeron, and Bricklink all fell short when it came to tracking sets and especially missing pieces across multiple copies of the same set.</p>\n<h1>Why I Built This</h1>\n<p>I keep all my sets inventoried in separate containers, and I wanted a simple way to track which sets are complete and which have missing pieces. When you're managing hundreds of sets and pieces occasionally go missing (as they do!), it becomes really challenging to keep track of everything with existing tools.</p>\n<h1>What can it do?</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Track multiple copies of the same set</strong> - Each set gets a unique ID, so you can track different missing pieces across duplicate sets</li>\n<li><strong>Manage missing pieces</strong> - Keep track of what's missing across your entire collection</li>\n<li><strong>View your complete inventory</strong> - See all parts and minifigures across your sets</li>\n<li><strong>Smart image handling</strong> - Images are downloaded once and stored locally, so you're not constantly hitting Rebrickable's API</li>\n<li><strong>Instructions management</strong> - Add PDF instructions for easy access</li>\n<li><strong>Wishlist support</strong> - Keep track of sets you want to add to your collection</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Screenshots</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://xbackbone.baerentsen.space/LaMU8/koLAhiWe94.png/raw\">Main interface with set overview</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://xbackbone.baerentsen.space/LaMU8/MeXaYuVI44.png/raw\">Parts inventory</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://xbackbone.baerentsen.space/LaMU8/YEPEKOsE50.png/raw\">Missing pieces tracker</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://xbackbone.baerentsen.space/LaMU8/RuWoduFU08.png/raw\">Minifigure collection</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://xbackbone.baerentsen.space/LaMU8/hACAbArO44.png/raw\">Wishlist</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Tech</h1>\n<p>It's built with Python3, Flask and SQLite, runs in Docker, and only requires a Rebrickable API key to get started. All the code is available on my <a href=\"https://gitea.baerentsen.space/FrederikBaerentsen/BrickTracker\">Gitea</a> instance, and setup is pretty straightforward with Docker Compose.</p>\n<h1>Note</h1>\n<p>This has been a hobby project that's grown over time, so don't expect enterprise-grade code! It's built to solve real problems I've had managing my LEGO collection, and I figured others might find it useful too.</p>\n<h1>Try it out!</h1>\n<p>You can find the project here: https://gitea.baerentsen.space/FrederikBaerentsen/BrickTracker\nIf you have any questions or run into issues, feel free to ask. I'd love to hear your feedback and suggestions!</p>\n<p>Once set up, it runs locally and only calls Rebrickable when adding new sets.</p>",

Its my third post here and I am so happy to tell that I have got like 5000 active users in the last 2 months, with 1000 repeating users. Let me start from starting, I built <a href=\"https://www.mldl.study/\">https://www.mldl.study/</a> back 2-3 months back. It provides proper roadmap for someone to go into field of AI. It has proper roadmap from ml prerequisite like maths and python to ml roadmap, dl roadmap, and even now genAI roadmap. I opensourced the site around 1 month ago and got great responses from everyone here. I was so happy that after my endsems got complete, I started working more on it. Now with the current update I have added genAI roadmap too and also a research paper section where there is all major research papers that you should read.</p>\n<p>The site has everything from video lectures, articles, visualizations, simulations, research papers, project work, competitions etc. Its a great site for anyone who really want to learn AI.</p>\n<p>Now even though i open sourced it back 1 month ago, I still did not got contributions that I had thought I would. I really really want you guys to contribute to the resources and help the community. I just want your support everyone , and I appreciate everyone who supported me in my last 2 posts and motivated me to work more on it.</p>\n<p>genAI roadmap is not completed and i really want you guys to contribute to the resources there. here is the link to the repo <a href=\"https://github.com/anshaneja5/mldl.study\">https://github.com/anshaneja5/mldl.study</a> . I would love if you guys want to give any suggestions too ;)</p>\n<p>I appreciate your time and patience, thanks guys ;)</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/4emr1i1tfm8e1.png?width=1558&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d2e4bc1972c32fb7d1d193b51933f791d1364696</p>",

I still remember the project\u2019s early days and loved seeing those first issues open on GitHub. How exciting it has been to build something useful for so many people. I am grateful for the compassionate community as well as the feedback and criticism we have received this year.</p>\n<p>The project's core idea is to do good things without a hidden agenda or ill motives, to give people a delightful choice to manage their digital media besides the solutions from exploitative big cloud providers. Just last year, we were daydreaming of how wonderful it would be if we could do those things daily as our full-time job. One might have said it is good karma, but Louis Rossman from FUTO found us and extended the invitation for the company to fund the project to let us develop the software full-time. It was a dream come true for all the core contributors to talk about Immich, interact with the users, have fun writing code, and build out the features of Immich every day. We would not be here without your love and support for the project.</p>\n<p>Similar to <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/18gz26i/immich_recap_for_2023_with_accomplished/\">last year</a>, here\u2019s a recap of everything the project accomplished in 2024:</p>\n<h1>Milestones</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>A new logo from the community contest</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/q2iy1s1h918e1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a6c5c9a36fd4bdb1ad6e9764334c24b6c4d37c6\">Y'all remember the Oda clan logo? :P</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>GPU acceleration for machine learning</li>\n<li>Library watching</li>\n<li>Search enhancement with advanced filtering</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/lda67eoi818e1.png?width=1944&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=600d46815eb1cc09c6afc3efc6eaff31c237e559\">Search enhancement</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Built-in OpenTelemetry metrics</li>\n<li>Read-only albums</li>\n<li>Email notifications</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/nqmrl66p818e1.png?width=1842&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c50dbd670fa337f53492b223f3ea58d04ef201a\">Email notification settings</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Microservices container be gone</li>\n<li>Web translation</li>\n<li>Immich-hosted map tiles</li>\n<li>Star rating</li>\n<li><strong>Basic editing on mobile</strong></li>\n<li>Theming on mobile</li>\n<li>Folder view</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/phrmaoku818e1.png?width=1623&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f7cae2bf3de5c7b03907806d57625b135874b9b\">Folder browser</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tag support</li>\n<li>Album sync on mobile</li>\n<li>Automatic database backup</li>\n<li>Auto-switching server URL in the mobile app</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/r444s107918e1.png?width=462&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6abafbebe0b096c5f428b006676155aec349b40c\">Automatic server URL switching</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Alternative machine learning URL switching</li>\n<li>Supporter Badge / <a href=\"http://buy.immich.app\">buy.immich.app</a></li>\n<li>and more</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Fun</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Over 30k stars were added to Immich\u2019s sky on GitHub <strong>\u2b50</strong> <em>[editor's note: Jan 16, 23940]</em></li>\n<li>Going from MIT to AGPLv3 License</li>\n<li>Over 900 awesome people from the community helped make Immich a better software.</li>\n<li>Overcame our first marketing fallout with the choice of wording in the product key purchase introduction</li>\n<li>Immich isn\u2019t even 3 years old yet.
