I've found so much joy in developing and learning new skills for this project. Below are some big updates for the app since my last update.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We can now perform the <strong>selective backup</strong>, the user can choose which album on the phone to be <em>included</em> or <em>excluded</em> for assets to be backup, and only unique, non-overlapping assets in those selections will be back up to the server. So, no more backing up your unwanted assets from Whatapps \ud83d\ude01.</li>\n<li>The server now generates WEBP format for the thumbnail. This mechanism drastically improves the performance of the app, in terms of network usage and speed of quick load and server resources. For example, previously, it took around 5 GB of data transfer to scroll and load 7000 assets thumbnail, now it takes around 50MB. This means you don't need a fast network for fast loading and reducing the response time of the server. I guess I can now technically add \"blazing fast \ud83d\ude80\" to the readme file \ud83d\ude01.</li>\n<li>The <strong>WEB</strong> is finally here. A website made with SvelteKit is now dockerized and added to docker-compose for ease of deployment. You can now register an admin account through the website and add additional users by using the web interface, no more clunky command line to create the user. AND you can also view the backup assets on the web now, with those assets grouped by date, giving the familiar experiment with Google Photos. I am working on more features on the web to make it better and nicer, stay tuned!</li>\n</ol>\n<p>And of course, those features come along with plenty of bug fixes and QoS improvement as well.</p>\n<p>You can access the <a href=\"https://github.com/alextran1502/immich\">project repository here on Github</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/alextran1502/immich\">https://github.com/alextran1502/immich</a></p>\n<p>I am still researching how to best add facial recognition and clustering to the app. Below are some screenshots of the current stage of the app.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/hbdiwew5r3191.jpg?width=708&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dbfbf86a2df53babb0b0a67480bc2d14d70374c3\">Update Interfaces and Features</a></p>\n<p>Thank you to those who contributed to the project and supported me financially, if you want to buy me a cup of coffee, you can find the link here <a href=\"https://www.buymeacoffee.com/altran1502\">https://www.buymeacoffee.com/altran1502</a></p>\n<p>Until next time!</p>\n<p>Alex</p></div>",

There's a lot. This is an example of what I was able to do on more than one of them. </p>\n<p>So I found an unsecured Heimdall that had actually been setup fairly well for personal use, but the owner was using the fancy enhanced buttons. So I opened up the application list and went into edit. </p>\n<p>This guy was running AdGuard Home and AdGuard Home requires you provide your username and password to use the enhanced features. The username was plain text and Heimdall isn't the most secure so if you inspect element on the password field and change the type to text, you can see the data entered.</p>\n<p>So now I have his username and password. People tend to reuse these.</p>\n<p>He was also running Sonarr/Radarr so I gave those a go, they were actually password protected, I put in the username and password I just got and boom, I was in them too.</p>\n<p>I opened up his indexer list and could see he was using a bunch of usenet indexers. Now I couldn't get the username and passwords for these directly, but I did have the API keys. And I could find the sites quite easilly and already knew his username and password so could give those a shot. Turns out that worked for a couple of them.</p>\n<p>I could also see his download client was NZBGet. That also stores username and password. They matched what I already had, but if they were different I would have had them too.</p>\n<p>I hop over to his NZBGet and from here I can see his download servers. They also store username and password (note here, sabNZB does NOT allow you to view the stored password, but NZBGet does).</p>\n<p>So now I go to the site for one of his servers and what do you know, same username and password combo. From here I could see our guys email address. Bet he reused the password...</p>\n<p>He did.</p>\n<p>Oh, he was also running Portainer as an enhanced app on Heimdall. Portainer requires username/password for that feature. So now I'm in his Portainer.</p>\n<p>If you're worrying, I did nothing with all this information. Well that's not true, I did add the classic 1995 movie \"Hackers\" to his Radarr.</p>\n<p>And then sent him an anonymous email explaining what I had done and left a note directly on his Heimdall in case he missed the email.</p>\n<p>So in conclussion, make sure your shit is secure and don't reuse passwords.</p></div>",

Migrating from -ng is as easy as pointing your docker image to the new location ( <code>ghcr.io/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx:latest</code> ) and re-creating (<em>reminder: backup first</em>). </p>\n<p><strong>Paperless-ngx</strong> is focused on being community-driven, this release alone has contributions from over 50 (!) people with over 250 commits since the old repository and includes new features, bug fixes and security updates. If you're interested, please check it out (there's a demo now too) and if you're willing to contribute we'd love to have you, we are already working on more features for the next release!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx\">https://github.com/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx</a></p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><em>More info for the curious:</em></p>\n<p>As many of you know \"Paperless-ng\" was a very popular fork of the  document management system \"Paperless\". The initial author of -ng, Jonas Winkler, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/k28247/paperlessng_is_here_almost/\">created an amazing project</a> that was <a href=\"https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/commit/9b0063c9731f7c5f65b1852cb8caff97f5e40ba4\">eventually designated</a> as the 'official' successor. He maintained a furious development pace for some time but as of this post hasn't been heard from in months. A group of folks dedicated to the software (myself included) decided to try and revive the project and hopefully set it up for a long future. Yes, a similar thing happened with the original Paperless, we are hoping to avoid some of the same mistakes. See <a href=\"https://github.com/jonaswinkler/paperless-ng/issues/1632\">jonaswinkler/paperless-ng#</a><a href=\"https://github.com/jonaswinkler/paperless-ng/issues/1599\">1599</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/jonaswinkler/paperless-ng/issues/1632\">jonaswinkler/paperless-ng#1632</a> and historically <a href=\"https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/issues/711\">the-paperless-project/paperless#711</a> if you are curious for more about all of this.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><em>FYI</em>:</p>\n<p>I'm <code>@shamoon</code> on Github, have contributed heavily to -ng and now -ngx so yes I'm biased! I don't speak for the group as a whole.</p></div>",

Apparently it's defragmenting in an infinite loop.</p>\n<p>It's affecting volumes mounted with <code>-o ssd,autodefrag</code>, which is the default in ~~most~~ some distributions (Manjaro, openSUSE installed with Calamares installer's defaults before 8 Dec 2021, possibly others). Check your <code>/etc/fstab</code>, if it doesn't have <code>autodefrag</code> on lines with <code>btrfs</code>, you're all right.</p>\n<p>This has the potential to wear out an SSD in a matter of weeks: on my Samsung PM981 Polaris 512GB this lead to 188 TB of writes in 10 days or so. That's several years of endurance gone. 370 full drive overwrites.</p>\n<p>The workaround is to disable autodefrag until this is resolved: <code>mount -o remount,noautodefrag /</code> and change <code>autodefrag</code> to <code>noautodefrag</code> in your <code>/etc/fstab</code>.</p>\n<p>Relevant linux mailing list thread: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-btrfs/CAEwRaO4y3PPPUdwYjNDoB9m9CLzfd3DFFk2iK1X6OyyEWG5-mg@mail.gmail.com/</p></div>",

So far it's been working great, and I thought I would share how I am using docker to easily selfhost my favorites services.</p>\n<p>Quite a few services are explained in this guide :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Traefik as reverse proxy and SSL manager, it is the core of this infrastructure, arguably the most detailled example</li>\n<li>Bitwarden, Wirehole, Synapse+Element, Nextcloud, Jellyfin,... A multitude of services to selfhost, feel free to choose your favorites</li>\n<li>Backups with a tested custom bash script </li>\n<li>Update with watchtower</li>\n<li>Notifications messages with a selfhosted gotify !</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/BaptisteBdn/docker-selfhosted-apps\">Link to the Github guide</a></p>\n<p>This guide is filled with examples and almost all services are ready to use, with the most difficult one being Traefik as you have to add your DNS provider configuration.\nA simple <code>git clone</code>, as well as modifying the <code>.env</code> should be enough to get you started on your selfhosting journey.</p>\n<p>The only thing not using docker is the backup strategy as it is uses custom bash scripts, I have been using it for a few months to upload my encrypted backups to AWS, and it has been working great. The backup restoration process has also been tested a few times.</p>\n<p>I tried to include as many references as I could and to include security as well, as it can be easily overlooked when selfhosting.</p>\n<p>This guide can be useful for beginners as well as experienced selfhosters looking to migrate to docker, or if you are just interested in seeing how docker works.</p></div>",

Earlier this year, we released Netmaker as a self-hosted project for private networking over WireGuard. This was one of the first communities to support the project, and we've had the honor of working with some of you closely. Today, we're announcing we're now a Y Combinator company. We wanted to say thanks to you all. It started here, and we couldn't have done it without you.</p></div>",

A few years ago I decided to experiment with docker, so I had separate containers for all my services.  </p>\n<p>Now, Nextcloud allows upgrades by one one version number at a time.  So if you want to upgrade from say version 20 to the current version 23 you have to go in steps: first upgrade to 21, then to 22, finally to 23.  I knew this, and have made several successful upgrades in the past.  But what did I do this time?  Tried to upgrade over 2 version numbers, thus breaking my installation.  I thought this might be a nice opportunity to re-install from scratch both Nextcloud and the reverse proxy Traefik, which provides security certificates from LetsEncrypt.   This turned out to be a non-trivial problem, as Traefik has undergone significant changes, and the old config file which I had was incompatible with the new version.  </p>\n<p>Well, if I was going to change all of this - why not upgrade the operating system itself, from Ubuntu 18.04 to 20.04 (both LTS)?  And so I set about doing that, something I've also done before (at least twice in fact).  But this time, after the system went into reboot to complete the upgrade, I couldn't access it again.  I tried to stop and start it from the tools provide by the hosting service, with no luck.  I contacted the admin of the hosting service, who told me that \"Its Grub is broken. That's why you can't stop/start it as it's deep in a failed Grub boot.\"  He recommended a re-image, unless I wanted him to see if he could fix it for me (for which I'd no doubt have to pay for his sys admin time).  </p>\n<p>A re-image would of course destroy everything and replace my system with a new, empty system.  In fact this might not be a bad thing, as I've accumulated all manner of junk over the years; things I've tried out and discarded.  (I used to run <a href=\"https://wordpress.org\">wordpress.org</a>, for example, until maintaining a reasonable level of security was getting troublesome.)</p>\n<p>Anyway, thanks to my hard-won skill (ha!) as a sys admin, I have gone from a working, usable VPS to one that is completely broken.  Go me!</p></div>",

But I would love it if I could define some form of pattern (i.e. by the mail's header) to automatically tag a document. Like if it came from my health care, it always has the same address in the header. So having the document automatically tagged this way would be really helpful.</p>\n<p>I am not sure if Paperless-ng does that. So... got any idea of a self hosted service that does?

Everything is protected and authenticated over the internet with a no-ip domain and a static IP from my ISP and running flawlessly! </p>\n<p>I've come to a point where I get wget any thing, tweak it to my linking, compile and use it. I'm this close to ditching windows if not held back by my current work requirements and go full sudo!</p>\n<p>So why am I here? </p>\n<p>Well, for my use case the Pi has plenty more headroom, but I can only do so much bare metal :( There are so many other services I'd like to host so that I can go full r/degoogle and make my digital life a lot more personal and under my control, but it's just not possible without going into the world or containers (Yes, looking at you docker and k8s's of the world!)</p>\n<p>I feel like a lot of things are behind bars simply because I'm running bare metal. Anyone else on the same boat? Is it worth going 64-bit and docker it all? Or is there anyway I can achieve the same non-docker? It's not that I'm hesitant to learn docker, it's just I convinced my family members to ditch G-drive as well, proudly I might add, and use the tiny yet powerful server lab and the data has been accumulated to a point that It's making me double think my priorities, for now.</p>\n<p>Help a budding linux noob decide what to do! _/\\_</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/poll/rerxlm\">View Poll</a></p></div>",

The rest are only accessible locally or via an OpenVPN server that\u2019s running on my router.</p>\n<p>Throughout this night, I got about 8 emails from the server\u2019s system monitoring about system resources being succeeded. This wasn\u2019t the first time I got an email like this, as I\u2019m running ZFS which keeps taking up over half of my RAM, and Minecraft and Nextcloud can take up the rest once all of my devices connect to autosync photos. I have never gotten so many at once though, except from when I misconfigured Duplicati and it did some weird stuff (I don\u2019t use it anymore).</p>\n<p>I have since taken the Minecraft container offline and derouted the Cloudflare connections to be safe(ish). Unfortunately I only know enough about the front end to build the server, but not nearly enough to know whether I could have been a victim of log4shell. Do you think this is cause for concern?</p></div>",

It includes so much stuff, albeit great, that I don't need or ever use.</p>\n<p>Graylog seemed to be way lighter but it didn't seem stable and hassle free. It kept breaking with unattended updates (meaning no f**#&amp; given just docker-compose pull &amp;&amp; up -d --force-recreate), and when it broke I losts all parser etc. had to pull up from zero, create/import groks pipelines etc.. And honestly, Kibana just looks prettier? Oh.. and yeah, stupid little thing, but in Graylog I cannot reorder columns?! In Kibana I can.</p>\n<p>I tried Grafana + Loki + Promtail. They were such a breeze, extremely lightweight and wile they did work, they are admittedly for different purposes. I didn't seem to be able to handle logs as easily as I could with Graylog or Kibana. Like no pretty columns, easy search etc. Although this might've been my lack of experience with Grafana - please do tell me so as this seems a lovely alternative.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>So is there anything else I can do or try to move away from ELK? Can you create a very basic Kibana-like dashboard in Grafana/Loki? Like add the columns, reorder them, etc? Nothing special but I just couldn't make it work? I either had raw logs and search or columns and all pretty (labels as columns transformation) but no search bar :(</p></div>",
