Then I started to test my documentation by starting from scratch. I repeated this countless times, switching even to new solutions after learning best practices. For example I switched from Ubuntu to Arch-based last year and completely updated the guide. What you have now is a complete, A to Z guide of things you need to do to setup your very own, energy efficient, homeserver.</p>\n<p>It is not just a How-To guide but for most people also a reference document, a 1-stop-shop containing all relevant information to build, install, configure and maintain  your own homeserver and the guide often offers you a few different options.</p>\n<p>Of course I also had to make choices, like OS and filesystem. While these were not simple choices and have been well thought-through, they may not be for everyone, but the guide does not need to be followed precisely from start till end. For example, for OS, Manjaro instead of plain Arch or Manjaro Minimal was chosen, to ensure you have to do as little as possible and giving you a lightweight, fast OS, benefiting from rolling updates instead of major upgrades and able to delete whatever you do not need.</p>\n<p>The guide now allows me to install a new server within 20 minutes, thanks to my post-install script (not required for the homeserver guide) and prep-server script (part of the guide). You will usually spend most time deciding what choice is best for you.</p>\n<p>It contains quite some detailed info, for example how to configure network, but also how to automatically delete watched episodes/movies unless you marked them as favourite. Or how to auto-update your download client port. And it is not just about mediaserving, that's just 1 aspect.</p>\n<p>Hope some people can benefit from having so much info organised in 1 single place. I had not come across something similar yet. Enjoy and feel free to create an issue on Github if you notice a typo or missing/confusing step.</p>\n<p>EDIT: I meant to post this in /r/homeserver. My mistake. I will leave it here as well for now.</p></div>",

I've found so much joy in developing and learning new skills for this project. Below are some big updates for the app since my last update.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We can now perform the <strong>selective backup</strong>, the user can choose which album on the phone to be <em>included</em> or <em>excluded</em> for assets to be backup, and only unique, non-overlapping assets in those selections will be back up to the server. So, no more backing up your unwanted assets from Whatapps \ud83d\ude01.</li>\n<li>The server now generates WEBP format for the thumbnail. This mechanism drastically improves the performance of the app, in terms of network usage and speed of quick load and server resources. For example, previously, it took around 5 GB of data transfer to scroll and load 7000 assets thumbnail, now it takes around 50MB. This means you don't need a fast network for fast loading and reducing the response time of the server. I guess I can now technically add \"blazing fast \ud83d\ude80\" to the readme file \ud83d\ude01.</li>\n<li>The <strong>WEB</strong> is finally here. A website made with SvelteKit is now dockerized and added to docker-compose for ease of deployment. You can now register an admin account through the website and add additional users by using the web interface, no more clunky command line to create the user. AND you can also view the backup assets on the web now, with those assets grouped by date, giving the familiar experiment with Google Photos. I am working on more features on the web to make it better and nicer, stay tuned!</li>\n</ol>\n<p>And of course, those features come along with plenty of bug fixes and QoS improvement as well.</p>\n<p>You can access the <a href=\"https://github.com/alextran1502/immich\">project repository here on Github</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/alextran1502/immich\">https://github.com/alextran1502/immich</a></p>\n<p>I am still researching how to best add facial recognition and clustering to the app. Below are some screenshots of the current stage of the app.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/hbdiwew5r3191.jpg?width=708&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dbfbf86a2df53babb0b0a67480bc2d14d70374c3\">Update Interfaces and Features</a></p>\n<p>Thank you to those who contributed to the project and supported me financially, if you want to buy me a cup of coffee, you can find the link here <a href=\"https://www.buymeacoffee.com/altran1502\">https://www.buymeacoffee.com/altran1502</a></p>\n<p>Until next time!</p>\n<p>Alex</p></div>",

There's a lot. This is an example of what I was able to do on more than one of them. </p>\n<p>So I found an unsecured Heimdall that had actually been setup fairly well for personal use, but the owner was using the fancy enhanced buttons. So I opened up the application list and went into edit. </p>\n<p>This guy was running AdGuard Home and AdGuard Home requires you provide your username and password to use the enhanced features. The username was plain text and Heimdall isn't the most secure so if you inspect element on the password field and change the type to text, you can see the data entered.</p>\n<p>So now I have his username and password. People tend to reuse these.</p>\n<p>He was also running Sonarr/Radarr so I gave those a go, they were actually password protected, I put in the username and password I just got and boom, I was in them too.</p>\n<p>I opened up his indexer list and could see he was using a bunch of usenet indexers. Now I couldn't get the username and passwords for these directly, but I did have the API keys. And I could find the sites quite easilly and already knew his username and password so could give those a shot. Turns out that worked for a couple of them.</p>\n<p>I could also see his download client was NZBGet. That also stores username and password. They matched what I already had, but if they were different I would have had them too.</p>\n<p>I hop over to his NZBGet and from here I can see his download servers. They also store username and password (note here, sabNZB does NOT allow you to view the stored password, but NZBGet does).</p>\n<p>So now I go to the site for one of his servers and what do you know, same username and password combo. From here I could see our guys email address. Bet he reused the password...</p>\n<p>He did.</p>\n<p>Oh, he was also running Portainer as an enhanced app on Heimdall. Portainer requires username/password for that feature. So now I'm in his Portainer.</p>\n<p>If you're worrying, I did nothing with all this information. Well that's not true, I did add the classic 1995 movie \"Hackers\" to his Radarr.</p>\n<p>And then sent him an anonymous email explaining what I had done and left a note directly on his Heimdall in case he missed the email.</p>\n<p>So in conclussion, make sure your shit is secure and don't reuse passwords.</p></div>",

I still have Gmail because it's a good junk mail pit but other than that, I have migrated all of my cloud services to my home server (and email hosting isn't worth it from what I hear). It feels pretty good to be out of the cloud and to have total ownership of my data. I'm so thankful to this community for making this possible!</p>\n<p>Here's my setup:</p>\n<h2>Services</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Document Storage: <a href=\"https://nextcloud.com\">Nextcloud</a></li>\n<li>Of course. I wish there was a less bloaty option but it's the best in the field.</li>\n<li>Document Editing: <a href=\"https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/DocumentServer\">OnlyOffice Document Server</a></li>\n<li>I tried hard to make LibreOffice work but OnlyOffice is just so clean</li>\n<li>Photo Management: <a href=\"https://photoprism.app/\">Photoprism</a></li>\n<li>Solid Google Photos replacement. Has facial recognition which is a must-have for me.</li>\n<li>Using Photosync for automatically uploading photos from my phone</li>\n<li>Smart Home: <a href=\"https://www.home-assistant.io/\">Home Assistant</a></li>\n<li>But of course. Awesome app. Wish I could get a job there.</li>\n<li>Network Video Recorder: <a href=\"https://frigate.video/\">Frigate</a></li>\n<li>Seriously one of the coolest parts of my home server. Totally local object detection and 24/7 recording. Better than any paid cloud service garbage.</li>\n<li>Media Streaming: <a href=\"https://jellyfin.org/\">Jellyfin</a></li>\n<li>I tried to get into Plex first but everything beyond the basics cost money and I'm really not going to be using it enough to be worth it.</li>\n<li>VPN: <a href=\"https://www.wireguard.com/\">Wireguard</a></li>\n<li>Classic.</li>\n<li>Chat: <a href=\"https://matrix.org/\">Matrix</a></li>\n<li>I only use this for getting messages from my home server.</li>\n<li>Push notifications don't work. Don't know why.</li>\n<li>Log Aggregation: <a href=\"https://www.graylog.org/\">Graylog</a></li>\n<li>It's really not a great app but we use it at work so whatevs.</li>\n<li>Backups: <a href=\"https://restic.net/\">Restic</a></li>\n<li>Great CLI tool for deduping and encrypting backups.</li>\n<li>Uses the snapshot model and can backup to S3.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Equipment</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Macbook Pro 2012, i7 2.6 GHz, 16 Gb RAM. Running Arch Linux (btw)</li>\n<li>Intel NUC 5th gen i5, 8 Gb RAM. Running Arch.</li>\n<li>Synology DiskStation NAS DS1019</li>\n<li>2x WD Red 4TB</li>\n<li>1x Seagate Skyhawk 2TB</li>\n<li>2x 500GB NVMe cache drives</li>\n<li>Linksys WRT3200ACM running <a href=\"https://openwrt.org/\">OpenWRT</a></li>\n<li>3x Reolink 4k IP Cameras</li>\n<li>1x Amcrest IP Camera</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Still on the Cloud</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://protonmail.com/\">ProtonMail</a></li>\n<li>Gmail</li>\n<li>Off-Site backups on <a href=\"https://www.storj.io/\">Storj.io</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://bitwarden.com/\">Bitwarden</a></li>\n<li>I was self-hosting this for a while but I figured, for 3 bucks a month or whatever, I can let them handle all my secrets.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Future Plans</h2>\n<p>I don't really know yet. I'm pretty happy with my setup. I'd like to get my server put together into a rackmount setup but it's working for now. I'm sure I'll find something else to self-host in another week or so.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>https://preview.redd.it/m1zypxw2cvo81.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8ddb637666b461a08df6d83aa08eeb64201cad75</p></div>",

Migrating from -ng is as easy as pointing your docker image to the new location ( <code>ghcr.io/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx:latest</code> ) and re-creating (<em>reminder: backup first</em>). </p>\n<p><strong>Paperless-ngx</strong> is focused on being community-driven, this release alone has contributions from over 50 (!) people with over 250 commits since the old repository and includes new features, bug fixes and security updates. If you're interested, please check it out (there's a demo now too) and if you're willing to contribute we'd love to have you, we are already working on more features for the next release!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx\">https://github.com/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx</a></p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><em>More info for the curious:</em></p>\n<p>As many of you know \"Paperless-ng\" was a very popular fork of the  document management system \"Paperless\". The initial author of -ng, Jonas Winkler, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/k28247/paperlessng_is_here_almost/\">created an amazing project</a> that was <a href=\"https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/commit/9b0063c9731f7c5f65b1852cb8caff97f5e40ba4\">eventually designated</a> as the 'official' successor. He maintained a furious development pace for some time but as of this post hasn't been heard from in months. A group of folks dedicated to the software (myself included) decided to try and revive the project and hopefully set it up for a long future. Yes, a similar thing happened with the original Paperless, we are hoping to avoid some of the same mistakes. See <a href=\"https://github.com/jonaswinkler/paperless-ng/issues/1632\">jonaswinkler/paperless-ng#</a><a href=\"https://github.com/jonaswinkler/paperless-ng/issues/1599\">1599</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/jonaswinkler/paperless-ng/issues/1632\">jonaswinkler/paperless-ng#1632</a> and historically <a href=\"https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/issues/711\">the-paperless-project/paperless#711</a> if you are curious for more about all of this.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><em>FYI</em>:</p>\n<p>I'm <code>@shamoon</code> on Github, have contributed heavily to -ng and now -ngx so yes I'm biased! I don't speak for the group as a whole.</p></div>",

Apparently it's defragmenting in an infinite loop.</p>\n<p>It's affecting volumes mounted with <code>-o ssd,autodefrag</code>, which is the default in ~~most~~ some distributions (Manjaro, openSUSE installed with Calamares installer's defaults before 8 Dec 2021, possibly others). Check your <code>/etc/fstab</code>, if it doesn't have <code>autodefrag</code> on lines with <code>btrfs</code>, you're all right.</p>\n<p>This has the potential to wear out an SSD in a matter of weeks: on my Samsung PM981 Polaris 512GB this lead to 188 TB of writes in 10 days or so. That's several years of endurance gone. 370 full drive overwrites.</p>\n<p>The workaround is to disable autodefrag until this is resolved: <code>mount -o remount,noautodefrag /</code> and change <code>autodefrag</code> to <code>noautodefrag</code> in your <code>/etc/fstab</code>.</p>\n<p>Relevant linux mailing list thread: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-btrfs/CAEwRaO4y3PPPUdwYjNDoB9m9CLzfd3DFFk2iK1X6OyyEWG5-mg@mail.gmail.com/</p></div>",
