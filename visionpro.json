However, I also believe it\u2019s crucial to recognize the technological marvel that this device truly is. In a device that fits in my hand, there are approximately 300 components, including 12 cameras, 5 sensors, 6 microphones, 2 4K displays, and horizontally mounted motors that adjust the displays\u2019 distance to ensure optimal viewing for each user\u2019s pupillary distance. Eye tracking is achieved through an array of LED lights and infrared cameras, forming the basis for the iris scanner and Optic ID. Sensors like accelerometers and gyroscopes track facial movements, minimizing discrepancies between the real world and the projected image. And all of this processing happens in roughly 12 milliseconds, which is 8 times faster than the blink of an eye. While I\u2019m all about criticizing this device and pointing out areas that can and should be improved, it\u2019s important not to let perfection become the enemy of progress. Sometimes, it\u2019s worth taking a moment to marvel at the technological achievement that has been made. Bravo, Apple!</p>",

He tried the app and thought it was great! I'm still pinching myself.</p>\n<p>Long story short, I ended up at Apple Park in California sharing the app's journey. From messing around with cameras in the NZ backcountry to presenting at Apple HQ - life's weird, huh?</p>\n<p>For those who don't know, Explore POV offers ultra-high resolution (up to 16K) immersive videos of breathtaking locations around the world. It's like teleporting to these places through your Vision Pro.</p>\n<p>I've never really talked about how Explore POV came to be, so I made this video. It's been the most insane journey.</p>\n<p>Some numbers, because I know Reddit loves data:\n- 300+ five-star ratings (still can't believe it)\n- 30,000+ downloads (thanks, every single one of you)\n- 150,000+ immersive experiences delivered</p>\n<p>Seriously, thank you all. This started as a crazy dream to share the world's beauty with everyone, and you guys made it a reality.</p>\n<p>Want to try Premium? I'm giving away 5 codes. Just comment your favorite Explore POV video and why. I'll randomly pick 5 winners this Friday.</p>\n<p>Oh, and there's a new Jungle adventure experience live today from the Caribbean - check it out.</p>\n<p>I'll be hanging out in the comments. Ask me anything - about the app, favourite hiking spots, or why I thought living in a motorhome was a good idea for 3 years!</p>\n<p>Chur, James</p>\n<p>P.S. You can find Explore POV here: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/explore-pov/id6479555991</p>",

I actually purchased the Quest 3 because it was so cheap on prime day and I was looking for a solution to be able to maintain my productivity while traveling. Mainly interested in virtual desktop. </p>\n<p>The quest 3 while fairly impressive for cost, I found the interface clunky, way too much focus on games AND I had no access to 1Password which made using it crazy painful. Then I decided to try avp and was sold instantly. Avp is well worth the money for the virtual display functionality alone. </p>\n<p>Why isn\u2019t there more interest in this platform. Tbh, all the reviews on it were so wrong. Definitely still a young platform with bugs that need worked out I.e. sharing keyboard from Mac doesn\u2019t let you shift\u2026 etc. </p>\n<p>But so much potential. And to think that I\u2019ve been and still am a vr hater. </p><div><br></div><img src=\"https://i.redd.it/t17d14purhhd1.jpeg\" />",

Your feedback will be invaluable as I refine the app.</p>\n<p>Currently I'm prioritizing content exploration over direct user interactions like commenting and posting. I plan to expand functionality to include full account features in the future, but I really want to avoid doing that until I get a better idea of average usage as I would need to pay for Reddit's API. Right now the goal is to make Pioneer as good as possible at being a Reddit reader.</p>\n<h1>Features</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Customizable Home Subreddit:</strong> Start your exploration in a universe tailored to your preferences. Choose a Home subreddit that aligns with your interests for a personalized gateway into Reddit's vast content landscape.</li>\n<li><strong>Favorites Feed:</strong> Seamlessly create your own constellation of preferred subreddits. This feature allows you to craft a unique feed that mirrors the dynamics of a personalized home feed, offering a curated exploration experience.</li>\n<li><strong>Seamless Navigation:</strong> With Pioneer, navigating the Reddit universe becomes a journey of discovery. Transition smoothly between your Home, Popular, All, and Favorites feeds, immersing yourself in the depth and diversity of content at your fingertips.</li>\n<li><strong>Instant Access to Popular and All:</strong> Delve into the heart of Reddit's community with instant access to r/popular and r/all, showcasing a wide array of discussions and discoveries that pulse through the platform.</li>\n<li><strong>Immersive Media Viewing:</strong> Dive deeper with a dedicated panel for videos, images, and galleries. Your visual and interactive content comes to life, making your browsing experience even more immersive.</li>\n<li><strong>Multi-Window Browsing:</strong> Get even more content at your fingertips. With multi-window browsing, you can juggle multiple threads and discussions simultaneously, enriching your Reddit journey.</li>\n<li><strong>Tailored for Apple Vision Pro:</strong> Experience Reddit like never before on the Apple Vision Pro. Pioneer leverages this advanced platform to deliver a visually stunning, intuitive browsing experience that's as expansive as it is engaging.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Known Issues</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Logging in, commenting, and changing account-specific settings is not supported yet (coming via an Ultra subscription in the future)</li>\n<li><strong>I've gone back and forth with the App Review team many times on this, but due to Apple's policies, NSFW content is not viewable in Pioneer at this time.</strong> Future updates will introduce account-based features, allowing logged-in users to access NSFW content. Adjustments to NSFW settings will be managed through Reddit's website, in compliance with Apple's guidelines.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Join the TestFlight Beta:</strong></p>\n<p>If you\u2019re interested in being part of this pioneering journey, you can join the TestFlight beta by clicking <a href=\"https://testflight.apple.com/join/0mmBPZXO\">here</a>. I'm looking for as much feedback as possible to make Pioneer the best it can be!</p>\n<p>Thank you for your support and enthusiasm. I can\u2019t wait to hear what you all think and look forward to your feedback and suggestions, which you can post to r/PioneerApp.</p>",

I am blown away by the comfort. The dual loop band is comfortable, but this really allows your blood to flow around your head and is so much softer. Since the attachment point is further up, it lifts the headset away from your face a bit more. For the second iteration, I will be 3-D printing a part to make it look a lot better. Also SO much easier to adjust. I\u2019m surprised Apple did not come up with this in the first place. Downside, is you have to buy an extra band which is $100. In my opinion, though, totally worth it. For the second iteration, I will be 3-D printing a part to make it look a lot better.</p><div><br></div><img src=\"https://i.redd.it/k9eh3wfljngc1.jpeg\" />",

The FOV by all other accounts has never been an issue.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>they complained about the color range stating you can only see 49% of the colors humans can see.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Everyone has also stated how colorful and beautiful the displays are. This is hardly a concern</p>\n<ul>\n<li>they complained about resolution</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Yet everyone has said how fantastic the passthrough and displays are. They mentioned a big caveat \u201cuse at night\u201d. Yes cameras don\u2019t see that well at night.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>they complained about it being a VR headset, nothing revolutionary </li>\n</ul>\n<p>No headset can do what this does. In the same way this tricks your brain into things there\u2019s something 3D in front of your eyes, it tricks you into thinking there\u2019s true AR. It\u2019s all the AR you\u2019ll need.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>they complained about personas and how bad they looked</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I thought they looked amazing. I could tell exactly who each person is and the expressions and gestures seemed natural</p>\n<p>Finally, the overarching theme\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s magic, until it\u2019s not\u201d</p>\n<p>He said that while things were new everything was amazing, but after you get used to it you start to notice the buggy times.</p>\n<p>Duh\u2026 of course. But that doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t still magical.</p>\n<p>If you have watched this persons opinions on VP before the actual review\u2026 you\u2019ll note the distaste for it. He has never liked this headset.</p>\n<p>The video production was fantastic, and he said lots of good things about it, but overall the video was negatively biased.</p>\n<p>Brian Tong did not fan boy, he showed you what it could do, and presented you with all the honest drawbacks at the end. The video was awesome, and should leave us feeling excited for the future!</p>\n<p>Don\u2019t let one video drag us down!</p>",

More than that they showed it at wwdc. But wwdc is a conference for developers. So they never showed it to consumers. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>we still don\u2019t know the specs or pricing (other than base model), just guessing on options and specs.

And I\u2019ve even seen more and more concern about how there is no \u201ckiller app\u201d yet. </p>\n<p>I decided to share my thoughts since I firmly believe there isn\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t be a \u201ckiller app\u201d.</p>\n<p>I was one of the first people to have an iPhone in 2007. But unlike most people who had one I didn\u2019t have any other Apple products, I didn\u2019t have a lot of money to spend on new gadgets, I didn\u2019t even have a cell phone yet.</p>\n<p>I got an iPhone in 2007, because I\u2019ve been needing an iPhone since about 2003 and I was sick of waiting. You see, the iPhone didn\u2019t have a killer app. What it had was a distinct singular value proposition the entire rest of the design derived from. The iPhone was <strong>the internet in your pocket</strong>. I knew that\u2019s what it was from how they talked about it and so I knew now was the time to get a cell phone. </p>\n<p>Before the iPhone, I had tried all kinds of other solutions. Not other cell phones \u2014 <em>because that\u2019s not what the iPhone is</em>. I tried these things we\u2019ve long since forgotten called PDAs made by companies we don\u2019t talk about anymore like the Palm Pilot or the Sony Treo. </p>\n<p>The same basic thing is true for the iPod. At the time, other companies were building \u201cmp3 players\u201d. And I got suckered into buying a Dell Axim over an iPod by Tom\u2019s guide or some other publication who made the mistake of putting specs side by side and assuming that\u2019s what makes the product. </p>\n<p>Sure, the Dell had more storage, but get what else it had\u2026 up and down buttons and a folder system \u2014 an absolute nightmare for navigating around a large amount of songs (which renders the larger storage pointless). The clickwheel and the UX to reinvent MP3 management is what made the iPod, <strong>all your music in your pocket</strong>.  </p>\n<h2>So what is the Apple Vision Pro?</h2>\n<p>The AVP is not a \u201cVR\u201d headset anymore than an iPhone is a PDA and comparing specs is as silly as it was when the Dell Axim Jukebox \u201coutperformed\u201d the iPod. The AVP is a whole new category no one has ever tried before \u2014 but I\u2019ve been asking for years. <strong>The Apple Vision Pro is a hands/desk free computer</strong>. </p>\n<p>Why would I want a desk and hands free computer? In product management, we call these \u201cUser journeys/needs\u201d:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>As someone who often works from home, I want to take video conferences while I straighten up around the house. I don\u2019t want to be tied to a desk</li>\n<li>As someone who sits all day working, I want to be able to get up and walk around while I give my brain some time off to watch a movie</li>\n<li>As someone who cooks for a family, I want to have my hands free while I look up recipes </li>\n<li>As someone with a young child, I want to be able to quickly keep an eye on her without being stuck in one room of the house while working</li>\n<li>As someone who gets bored easily, I want to be able to ~~doom~~scroll Reddit while I fold laundry</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I can\u2019t do any of that with any other VR system because what they are isn\u2019t a hands free computer. They are an immersive gaming platform. </p>\n<p>How do I know the Apple Vision Pro is a hands free computer? The choices they made:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In order to be a desk free computer, it has to be at least as good as a normal computer which means it cannot leave me blind to the outside world. The entire system was built around looking through the AVP like you\u2019re looking through glass</li>\n<li>In order to be a hands free computer, it cannot rely on controllers. They made it purely gesture based for a reason. </li>\n<li>In order to take that conference call while cleaning around the house, I need it to solve the awkward \u201cwhere is my head\u201d problem. They sure put a lot of hardware together to make this one specific thing work. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Everything Apple focused on pointed at one specific killer <em>application</em> \u2014 the entire system. The entire system is built around bringing computation into an ambient, hands free, desk free, ubiquitous experience. That\u2019s why I\u2019m getting it. </p>\n<p>We won\u2019t know if Apple will be successful yet. At this price point it really is still an experiment. And the most important inflection point will probably be in how much public acceptance there is.</p>",

This scan will tell the employee hosting the demo which light seal, foam cushion and band size the customer will need. The light seal, which keeps outside light from leaking in, comes in more than 25 shapes and sizes. The cushions, meanwhile, come in two sizes.</p>\n<p>Once the unit is in hand, the employee will explain how the interface works. That includes how to control the pointer using a user\u2019s eyes, how to gesture to make selections and how to hold the headset. The staffer will also show how to adjust the so-called Fit Dial on the main headband and how to use the Digital Crown for moving between virtual and augmented reality. The employee will have an iPad to view what the user is seeing on the Vision Pro.</p>\n<p>The retail employee will allow users to place the device on their own heads. Once the headset is on, customers will need to calibrate the device with various tracking and tapping exercises so it can follow their eyes and hands. That includes looking at circular dot patterns set at different brightness levels and a hand scan in the field of vision of the device.</p>\n<p>After all that, the roughly 20- to 25-minute demo can begin:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Users will be directed to the photos app to view still images that are similar to the ones preloaded on Apple\u2019s other devices in retail stores. That\u2019s followed by examples of panorama shots.</li>\n<li>Then the demo starts to get more interesting. The customer sees 3D images that Apple calls spatial photos (in this case, of a kid hitting a pi\u00f1ata) and a spatial video (footage of a birthday party).</li>\n<li>The next part of the demo shows how to use the device as a computer or iPad replacement. It explains how to position multiple app windows in space and scroll through webpages in the Safari browser.</li>\n<li>Customers are then shown 3D and immersive movies, including clips of wild animals, the ocean and sports. There is also a compelling scene that makes users feel as if they\u2019re on a tightrope.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-01-14/how-to-buy-apple-vision-pro-3-499-device-to-go-on-sale-feb-2-lrdjtdm7?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=tech&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-tech&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic\">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-01-14/how-to-buy-apple-vision-pro-3-499-device-to-go-on-sale-feb-2-lrdjtdm7?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=tech&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-tech&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic</a></p>",

I purchased a metal case to hold it (and used the online AR at Apple to get a picture). Hoping it fits but I have faith.  I\u2019m going add an internal 50A battery to the case with a USB port that I can plug the AVP into for extended periods.</p>\n<p>I also purchased an external charger that I can also keep in the case to refill the battery when not in use.  I may add another port to ease that process as well.</p>\n<p>I got a thin Bluetooth keyboard with trackpad that I tested on my iPad Pro, which feels really good and fits well inside the case while allowing for closure.  This is for writing and creating documents using the AVP.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m trying to get my eye prescription updated this week so that I can order the inserts with the preorder.  If that doesn\u2019t happen, I got a set of cheaters that sit on the nose only to at least allow me to use the Vision while waiting on the prescription lenses.  I tested these on my FPV goggles for RC and they work pretty good.  Not great long term, but I needed a solution until my prescription lenses arrive, in case I can\u2019t order them during preorder.</p>\n<p>Lastly I ordered some wipes to use on my face before each time I put the AVP goggles on, which will help keep them clean longer.  They will also help when allowing others to try them out.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s it for the moment.  As I get more antsy, we\u2019ll see what else my mind comes up with while I wait.</p><div><br></div><img src=\"https://i.redd.it/kjw59kxgpacc1.jpeg\" />",

Maybe this can be pinned to the top so people can quit asking the same questions over and over that none of us know the answer to</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We don't know if there will be more than 256gb offered. Some believe there will only be 255gb to start and some others think there will be more because Apple stated \"starting at 3,499\"</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It is not known how the prescription insert process will work. We don't know if you need a valid dated prescription that needs to be uploaded and then verified or if it's just typing in your prescription details. We do know that they can only be purchased online and not in store, though store pickup isn't known yet. There are also no details for those that require special lenses for extreme eyesight issues. Lastly, we don't know how long this process will take on launch date. It's possible that taking the time to type in your prescription details will lead to you getting your shipping date pushed back, if this thing really sells fast in limited quantities. There is still the possibility Apple will open up adding your prescription info and saving it before the actual preorder date. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We don't know if you can buy a separate battery, at least on launch. We also don't know the cost or if they will have higher capacity batteries available at any point. We don't know if swapping batteries mid session means your headset completely turns off or if there is a very small reserve battery inside the headset that can power things on standby while you swap. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We don't know if more cushions/seals are offered if you buy in store vs online. We don't even know how many seals are available to choose from or what the fitting process looks like. It's not known if there is a more intensive fitting process in store vs online or if it's all sort of the same. It's possible there will be a face scan you can do with your phone that can help you pick the proper size. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We don't know how fast the shipping dates will start moving back. We also don't know how many they'll have in store. I do think they'll have more than a few in each store, but I wouldn't expect a whole lot more than that. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We don't know of any first party accessories for sale yet that are not included, like stands, etc. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We don't know or can't fully advise those of you not in the US what to do or how to buy this with 100 percent confidence on launch. Outside of flying to the US and hoping you can get one on launch date, there isn't much advice to give. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We don't know if you can wear a hat comfortably while using it yet. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Though we don't know officially how many accounts you can have on one AVP, it seems all signs point to a single user and a single guest account per headset. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We don't know when it's launching in Europe yet or anywhere outside of the US. There are only guesses and rumors so far. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We don't know of any other event leading up to the release, but we do expect some select YouTubers to have hands on impression/reviews before launch. These videos can possibly help answer a lot of unknowns listed here.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

Can an MV-HEVC be stereoscopic 3d? Not really grasping how an edge can have 6DoF either... I mean, it can track you, but that is more the software playing the video than the actual video... I would think.\" (Credit Eric)  </p>\n<p>This is my personal understanding and opinion (Please chime in as there are more experts in this group who can answer way better than I ever can):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Any SBS mp4 (all Hollywood 3D movies) can be Spatial Video. I have a tutorial coming up to show people how Hollywood is doing to convert them into Spatial Video (they want to make money on Apple's new platform, and 3D, in general, is way more expensive than 2D film, so...)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Any MV-HEVC can be stereo 3D for Meta Quest 3 or 3DTV. My other post on here already shows how. I can even stream LIVE MV-HEVC to any 3DTV (Apple might not be pleased about it, but I am one of those open-source guys who value accessibility more than Apple making all the money)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>6DoF or Volumetric Video is captured (or AI-generated) area the initial camera did not capture. Viewers have free head movement (6DoF movement) to see behind the screen like in real life - it is the most true-to-life immersive experience. Microsoft and others have been doing it for the past 5 years but it is so expensive they have to cut the losses. It is the future but it is not here yet (cost concern). Apple is smart and not want to go down that rabbit hole like Google...</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>3D and Volumetric capture / Lightfield capture are fundamentally different. People think Apple achieved the latter but in fact not. But with AI generative tech supercharging the industry - it might be sooner than all of us think. Apple can buy it when it is mature and put it in spatial video / vision pro.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There are active researches in all these areas including NeRF / G-Splat that are coming in HOT to bring costs down so it is very possible we will have 6DoF video soon on Vision Pro. Single scan to 6DoF video is already possible in VR180. There are noise that need to be clear up but looking at how fast G-Spat 3D has grow in just the past 3 months. It is possible Apple can drop the ball and wow all of us and we will know soon end of this month.   </p>\n<p>If you have insight in this topic, or questions, or disagree with anything I said. Please comment . </p>\n<p>This is my personal understanding and I can be so wrong. I am passioned in immersive filmmaking - I don't care if Apple labelled it Spatial Video or Google labeled it VR180 - as long as the immersive landscape is growing and more viewers are coming in - it is good news for the industry.  </p>",

Vision Pro does scan your environment on the fly and is capable of occluding objects. In the example of the movie screen an object will temporarily occlude during placement then the screen will occlude anything in front of it for the purposes of not covering the images you\u2019re viewing.</p><div><br></div><img src=\"https://i.redd.it/9oum4wh9mgac1.jpeg\" />",
