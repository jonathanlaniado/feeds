We are researching accessibility barriers that are created by virtual reality and augmented reality technology. The goal of our research is to figure out how we can make VR and AR hardware more accessible (the ethics approval for our research is 2023/352 and we also have linktree \u2013 linktr.ee/vrdisability). </p>\n<p>We are looking for people with disabilities who have tried AR and/or VR before to complete our survey and tell us about their experiences. </p>\n<p>The survey should take no longer than twenty minutes to complete, and if you don\u2019t want to or can\u2019t answer a question, all the questions are skippable.
