A perfect buy for that purpose.</p>\n<p>I haven't used it for anything else because the videos look terrible, mostly due to bitrate/resolution issues rather than the Quest 2's screen/lenses. And most games are either garbage or make you dizzy.</p>\n<p>A few days ago, I got the Quest 3. While the lens clarity has improved significantly and the resolution is a little bit better, there's still an irreparable flaw: motion sickness. Additionally, video quality remains poor due to the lamentable content quality on Meta Quest TV. YouTube's app is also affected, and now there's a bug limiting the Quest 3 to a maximum quality of 1080s. In contrast, on the Quest 2 and Quest 1, you could easily watch videos at 4096s (that it's also not enough quality, pixels look like stones)</p>\n<p>The ability to consume content should be a top feature of the device since that's what attracts the masses (and Apple understands this well). However, Meta seems indifferent.</p>\n<p>But the worst part is the motion sickness. I tried Assassin's Creed Nexus VR that came out yesterday, set it to full immersive mode using the joystick for movement, and it was terrible\u2014I felt dizzy within seconds.</p>\n<p>Other options to avoid motion sickness completely ruin the sense of virtual reality. They either confine you in dive goggles or make you move in a choppy manner, etc.</p>\n<p>No, masses are NOT going to want to adapt to this, at all. They're not us/you</p>\n<p>The future seems to lean more towards Augmented Reality, as hinted by Apple's headset. And then, in specific situations, enabling an immersive mode for watching content. Apple is not solving motion sickness but rather creating experiences that avoid it. </p>\n<p>Nevertheless, I appreciate Meta's efforts, but with their current trajectory and strategy, there's a long way to go before Mixed Reality becomes a reality.</p>\n<p>In my opinion, Apple's strategy is better, and will bring MR to the place we all want it to be\u2014create a super expensive headset that is spectacular, and people will be amazed. This will spark interest in Mixed Reality, and prices will drop in a few years.</p>\n<p>Meta makes a mistake by focusing on the wrong experiences. Apple gets it right; in their Vision Pro videos, everything is calm experiences because they know those are the ones that truly work.</p>\n<p>And of course, they've equipped the Vision Pro with impressive screens to astonish people with content playback and productivity, this is what will propel it to stardom.</p>\n<p>Designating a headset for mediocre games or games that make the masses dizzy is certainly not the key to success.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Certainly, augmented reality is the future. Moreover, you feel strange when you take off the headset and return to your normal reality without being able to interact. Especially when, instead of using controllers, you use your hands. Vision Pro is focusing exactly on that, not a coincidence.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>PS:  The part I liked the most about Assassin's Creed is the beginning, where you're on a call and have to solve a puzzle by moving around your house, but in augmented reality instead of virtual reality. Then it switched to virtual reality, and the immersion and enjoyment went downhill because it just looks really cheap and makes you dizzy.</p>",

Floor to ceiling life like video with your favorite artist. I also saw that Meta had <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZgav0w-6k0\">Meghan The Stallion concert in VR</a>.  Meghan being a pioneer in this, the video is 60K fps with 3d (Left and right) 180 VR. Reviews of the Meghan concert which also played in some VR theatres that people felt like Meghan was actually performing music inches away from them.</p>\n<p>Now Imagine this, you and your friends join you from anywhere in the world with their Vision Pro, you and your friends are in a private VR world, and then the concert begins. You get a personal concert up on the stage, face to face with your favorite artists and musicians and no random annoying other fans or people, just you and your friends and the artist.</p>\n<p>You don't have to deal with parking, you don't have to deal with large crowds, you can pause it for a bathroom and food breaks, you'll get engineer tuned audio and lighting. With the recent Taylor Swift tour, ticketmaster sold out in seconds and I heard some people paid as much as $20K to get a seat that was still pretty far away from the Concert. Imagine you get a front row, up on the stage. It feels personal like they invited you and your friends. You don't have to leave your living room and you can view at anytime. It's fully immersive and turns you living room into a concert.</p>\n<p>I can't wait and I hope they do this with many other artists and give an option for your friends to join too. (Note: I don't know if this will ever happen, but I hope it will)</p>\n<p>Edit: Also imagine Immersive 3d Music videos that you get to be in that don't look like crap (sorry a lot of 360 content isn't very good out there right now)</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>",

An app that allows you to view your sheet music in virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) environments.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/dkhojyjzc2rb1.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43569e64f385b3b8354826995b7fbcfa76f18586\">SheetMusicVR usage scenario</a></p>\n<p>While we're not quite ready for a public release, we'll open up an early beta program soon. Please head to our website at <a href=\"https://sheetmusicvr.com\">sheetmusicvr.com</a> and sign up for the waitlist to reserve your spot. The more subscribers we have, the more time we can allocate working on it and the faster we can get it in your hands! So please sign up!!! \ud83d\ude09<br />\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <a href=\"https://sheetmusicvr.com\">sheetmusicvr.com</a> &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>\n<p>This app idea has been floating around my head for quite a while. In fact, I asked 3 years ago what you would think about such an app: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/OculusQuest/comments/igytrw/shall_we_develop_a_vr_music_stand_app_for_the/\">reddit.com/r/OculusQuest/comments/igytrw/shall_we_develop_a_vr_music_stand_app_for_the/</a></p>\n<p>While it good quite a few upvotes, the most common concern was that it should be an AR app to allow users to see their instrument / surroundings and that the resolution might not be good enough for delicate music symbols.</p>\n<p>With the upcoming Meta Quest 3 and Apple Vision Pro, however, we felt that the time was finally ripe for this app! We can't wait to make this a reality! \ud83d\ude01</p>\n<p>For more regular updates you can also follow us on \ud835\udd4f: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SheetMusicVR\">x.com/SheetMusicVR</a></p></div>",
