I am blown away by the comfort. The dual loop band is comfortable, but this really allows your blood to flow around your head and is so much softer. Since the attachment point is further up, it lifts the headset away from your face a bit more. For the second iteration, I will be 3-D printing a part to make it look a lot better. Also SO much easier to adjust. I\u2019m surprised Apple did not come up with this in the first place. Downside, is you have to buy an extra band which is $100. In my opinion, though, totally worth it. For the second iteration, I will be 3-D printing a part to make it look a lot better.</p><div><br></div><img src=\"https://i.redd.it/k9eh3wfljngc1.jpeg\" />",

More than that they showed it at wwdc. But wwdc is a conference for developers.

And I\u2019ve even seen more and more concern about how there is no \u201ckiller app\u201d yet. </p>\n<p>I decided to share my thoughts since I firmly believe there isn\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t be a \u201ckiller app\u201d.</p>\n<p>I was one of the first people to have an iPhone in 2007. But unlike most people who had one I didn\u2019t have any other Apple products, I didn\u2019t have a lot of money to spend on new gadgets, I didn\u2019t even have a cell phone yet.</p>\n<p>I got an iPhone in 2007, because I\u2019ve been needing an iPhone since about 2003 and I was sick of waiting. You see, the iPhone didn\u2019t have a killer app. What it had was a distinct singular value proposition the entire rest of the design derived from. The iPhone was <strong>the internet in your pocket</strong>. I knew that\u2019s what it was from how they talked about it and so I knew now was the time to get a cell phone. </p>\n<p>Before the iPhone, I had tried all kinds of other solutions. Not other cell phones \u2014 <em>because that\u2019s not what the iPhone is</em>. I tried these things we\u2019ve long since forgotten called PDAs made by companies we don\u2019t talk about anymore like the Palm Pilot or the Sony Treo. </p>\n<p>The same basic thing is true for the iPod. At the time, other companies were building \u201cmp3 players\u201d. And I got suckered into buying a Dell Axim over an iPod by Tom\u2019s guide or some other publication who made the mistake of putting specs side by side and assuming that\u2019s what makes the product. </p>\n<p>Sure, the Dell had more storage, but get what else it had\u2026 up and down buttons and a folder system \u2014 an absolute nightmare for navigating around a large amount of songs (which renders the larger storage pointless). The clickwheel and the UX to reinvent MP3 management is what made the iPod, <strong>all your music in your pocket</strong>.  </p>\n<h2>So what is the Apple Vision Pro?</h2>\n<p>The AVP is not a \u201cVR\u201d headset anymore than an iPhone is a PDA and comparing specs is as silly as it was when the Dell Axim Jukebox \u201coutperformed\u201d the iPod. The AVP is a whole new category no one has ever tried before \u2014 but I\u2019ve been asking for years. <strong>The Apple Vision Pro is a hands/desk free computer</strong>. </p>\n<p>Why would I want a desk and hands free computer? In product management, we call these \u201cUser journeys/needs\u201d:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>As someone who often works from home, I want to take video conferences while I straighten up around the house. I don\u2019t want to be tied to a desk</li>\n<li>As someone who sits all day working, I want to be able to get up and walk around while I give my brain some time off to watch a movie</li>\n<li>As someone who cooks for a family, I want to have my hands free while I look up recipes </li>\n<li>As someone with a young child, I want to be able to quickly keep an eye on her without being stuck in one room of the house while working</li>\n<li>As someone who gets bored easily, I want to be able to ~~doom~~scroll Reddit while I fold laundry</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I can\u2019t do any of that with any other VR system because what they are isn\u2019t a hands free computer. They are an immersive gaming platform. </p>\n<p>How do I know the Apple Vision Pro is a hands free computer? The choices they made:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In order to be a desk free computer, it has to be at least as good as a normal computer which means it cannot leave me blind to the outside world. The entire system was built around looking through the AVP like you\u2019re looking through glass</li>\n<li>In order to be a hands free computer, it cannot rely on controllers. They made it purely gesture based for a reason. </li>\n<li>In order to take that conference call while cleaning around the house, I need it to solve the awkward \u201cwhere is my head\u201d problem. They sure put a lot of hardware together to make this one specific thing work. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Everything Apple focused on pointed at one specific killer <em>application</em> \u2014 the entire system. The entire system is built around bringing computation into an ambient, hands free, desk free, ubiquitous experience. That\u2019s why I\u2019m getting it. </p>\n<p>We won\u2019t know if Apple will be successful yet. At this price point it really is still an experiment. And the most important inflection point will probably be in how much public acceptance there is.</p>",

This scan will tell the employee hosting the demo which light seal, foam cushion and band size the customer will need. The light seal, which keeps outside light from leaking in, comes in more than 25 shapes and sizes. The cushions, meanwhile, come in two sizes.</p>\n<p>Once the unit is in hand, the employee will explain how the interface works. That includes how to control the pointer using a user\u2019s eyes, how to gesture to make selections and how to hold the headset. The staffer will also show how to adjust the so-called Fit Dial on the main headband and how to use the Digital Crown for moving between virtual and augmented reality. The employee will have an iPad to view what the user is seeing on the Vision Pro.</p>\n<p>The retail employee will allow users to place the device on their own heads. Once the headset is on, customers will need to calibrate the device with various tracking and tapping exercises so it can follow their eyes and hands. That includes looking at circular dot patterns set at different brightness levels and a hand scan in the field of vision of the device.</p>\n<p>After all that, the roughly 20- to 25-minute demo can begin:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Users will be directed to the photos app to view still images that are similar to the ones preloaded on Apple\u2019s other devices in retail stores. That\u2019s followed by examples of panorama shots.</li>\n<li>Then the demo starts to get more interesting. The customer sees 3D images that Apple calls spatial photos (in this case, of a kid hitting a pi\u00f1ata) and a spatial video (footage of a birthday party).</li>\n<li>The next part of the demo shows how to use the device as a computer or iPad replacement. It explains how to position multiple app windows in space and scroll through webpages in the Safari browser.</li>\n<li>Customers are then shown 3D and immersive movies, including clips of wild animals, the ocean and sports. There is also a compelling scene that makes users feel as if they\u2019re on a tightrope.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-01-14/how-to-buy-apple-vision-pro-3-499-device-to-go-on-sale-feb-2-lrdjtdm7?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=tech&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-tech&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic\">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-01-14/how-to-buy-apple-vision-pro-3-499-device-to-go-on-sale-feb-2-lrdjtdm7?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=tech&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-tech&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic</a></p>",

I purchased a metal case to hold it (and used the online AR at Apple to get a picture). Hoping it fits but I have faith.  I\u2019m going add an internal 50A battery to the case with a USB port that I can plug the AVP into for extended periods.</p>\n<p>I also purchased an external charger that I can also keep in the case to refill the battery when not in use.  I may add another port to ease that process as well.</p>\n<p>I got a thin Bluetooth keyboard with trackpad that I tested on my iPad Pro, which feels really good and fits well inside the case while allowing for closure.  This is for writing and creating documents using the AVP.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m trying to get my eye prescription updated this week so that I can order the inserts with the preorder.  If that doesn\u2019t happen, I got a set of cheaters that sit on the nose only to at least allow me to use the Vision while waiting on the prescription lenses.  I tested these on my FPV goggles for RC and they work pretty good.  Not great long term, but I needed a solution until my prescription lenses arrive, in case I can\u2019t order them during preorder.</p>\n<p>Lastly I ordered some wipes to use on my face before each time I put the AVP goggles on, which will help keep them clean longer.  They will also help when allowing others to try them out.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s it for the moment.  As I get more antsy, we\u2019ll see what else my mind comes up with while I wait.</p><div><br></div><img src=\"https://i.redd.it/kjw59kxgpacc1.jpeg\" />",

Maybe this can be pinned to the top so people can quit asking the same questions over and over that none of us know the answer to</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We don't know if there will be more than 256gb offered. Some believe there will only be 255gb to start and some others think there will be more because Apple stated \"starting at 3,499\"</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It is not known how the prescription insert process will work. We don't know if you need a valid dated prescription that needs to be uploaded and then verified or if it's just typing in your prescription details. We do know that they can only be purchased online and not in store, though store pickup isn't known yet. There are also no details for those that require special lenses for extreme eyesight issues. Lastly, we don't know how long this process will take on launch date. It's possible that taking the time to type in your prescription details will lead to you getting your shipping date pushed back, if this thing really sells fast in limited quantities. There is still the possibility Apple will open up adding your prescription info and saving it before the actual preorder date. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We don't know if you can buy a separate battery, at least on launch. We also don't know the cost or if they will have higher capacity batteries available at any point. We don't know if swapping batteries mid session means your headset completely turns off or if there is a very small reserve battery inside the headset that can power things on standby while you swap. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We don't know if more cushions/seals are offered if you buy in store vs online. We don't even know how many seals are available to choose from or what the fitting process looks like. It's not known if there is a more intensive fitting process in store vs online or if it's all sort of the same. It's possible there will be a face scan you can do with your phone that can help you pick the proper size. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We don't know how fast the shipping dates will start moving back. We also don't know how many they'll have in store. I do think they'll have more than a few in each store, but I wouldn't expect a whole lot more than that. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We don't know of any first party accessories for sale yet that are not included, like stands, etc. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We don't know or can't fully advise those of you not in the US what to do or how to buy this with 100 percent confidence on launch. Outside of flying to the US and hoping you can get one on launch date, there isn't much advice to give. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We don't know if you can wear a hat comfortably while using it yet. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Though we don't know officially how many accounts you can have on one AVP, it seems all signs point to a single user and a single guest account per headset. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We don't know when it's launching in Europe yet or anywhere outside of the US. There are only guesses and rumors so far. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We don't know of any other event leading up to the release, but we do expect some select YouTubers to have hands on impression/reviews before launch. These videos can possibly help answer a lot of unknowns listed here.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

Here are some questions and I quote \"I kind of feel like you (me the OP) said it is marketing jargon. I mean the video is the same, minus an edge and a format type? Can an SBS MP4 be spacial video? Can an MV-HEVC be stereoscopic 3d? Not really grasping how an edge can have 6DoF either... I mean, it can track you, but that is more the software playing the video than the actual video... I would think.\" (Credit Eric)  </p>\n<p>This is my personal understanding and opinion (Please chime in as there are more experts in this group who can answer way better than I ever can):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Any SBS mp4 (all Hollywood 3D movies) can be Spatial Video. I have a tutorial coming up to show people how Hollywood is doing to convert them into Spatial Video (they want to make money on Apple's new platform, and 3D, in general, is way more expensive than 2D film, so...)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Any MV-HEVC can be stereo 3D for Meta Quest 3 or 3DTV. My other post on here already shows how. I can even stream LIVE MV-HEVC to any 3DTV (Apple might not be pleased about it, but I am one of those open-source guys who value accessibility more than Apple making all the money)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>6DoF or Volumetric Video is captured (or AI-generated) area the initial camera did not capture. Viewers have free head movement (6DoF movement) to see behind the screen like in real life - it is the most true-to-life immersive experience. Microsoft and others have been doing it for the past 5 years but it is so expensive they have to cut the losses. It is the future but it is not here yet (cost concern). Apple is smart and not want to go down that rabbit hole like Google...</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>3D and Volumetric capture / Lightfield capture are fundamentally different. People think Apple achieved the latter but in fact not. But with AI generative tech supercharging the industry - it might be sooner than all of us think. Apple can buy it when it is mature and put it in spatial video / vision pro.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There are active researches in all these areas including NeRF / G-Splat that are coming in HOT to bring costs down so it is very possible we will have 6DoF video soon on Vision Pro. Single scan to 6DoF video is already possible in VR180. There are noise that need to be clear up but looking at how fast G-Spat 3D has grow in just the past 3 months. It is possible Apple can drop the ball and wow all of us and we will know soon end of this month.   </p>\n<p>If you have insight in this topic, or questions, or disagree with anything I said. Please comment . </p>\n<p>This is my personal understanding and I can be so wrong. I am passioned in immersive filmmaking - I don't care if Apple labelled it Spatial Video or Google labeled it VR180 - as long as the immersive landscape is growing and more viewers are coming in - it is good news for the industry.  </p>",

Vision Pro does scan your environment on the fly and is capable of occluding objects. In the example of the movie screen an object will temporarily occlude during placement then the screen will occlude anything in front of it for the purposes of not covering the images you\u2019re viewing.</p><div><br></div><img src=\"https://i.redd.it/9oum4wh9mgac1.jpeg\" />",

Here is my argument:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>For context, there are &lt;12k people on this sub and even less on the Discord. I'd venture that the Venn Diagram of early adopters willing to shell out this much money for a V1 of a product and those who use Reddit probably has a bit of overlap.</li>\n<li>The BASE PRICE is $3500, but there is little chance that's what you walk out the door paying. After sales tax, prescription lenses, and whatever other accessories Apple comes up with I'd be willing to bet the price tag is closer to $5k than to the $3500 for most people. That's a lot of disposable income, especially considering the impact of recent inflation on consumers.</li>\n<li>It's only a US release. My guess is that they restrict the purchases to those who are verified Apple customers who live in the US. I also wouldn't be surprised if they gave first crack to those who are registered in their developer community, as that is clearly their target customer.</li>\n</ol>",

A perfect buy for that purpose.</p>\n<p>I haven't used it for anything else because the videos look terrible, mostly due to bitrate/resolution issues rather than the Quest 2's screen/lenses. And most games are either garbage or make you dizzy.</p>\n<p>A few days ago, I got the Quest 3. While the lens clarity has improved significantly and the resolution is a little bit better, there's still an irreparable flaw: motion sickness. Additionally, video quality remains poor due to the lamentable content quality on Meta Quest TV. YouTube's app is also affected, and now there's a bug limiting the Quest 3 to a maximum quality of 1080s. In contrast, on the Quest 2 and Quest 1, you could easily watch videos at 4096s (that it's also not enough quality, pixels look like stones)</p>\n<p>The ability to consume content should be a top feature of the device since that's what attracts the masses (and Apple understands this well). However, Meta seems indifferent.</p>\n<p>But the worst part is the motion sickness. I tried Assassin's Creed Nexus VR that came out yesterday, set it to full immersive mode using the joystick for movement, and it was terrible\u2014I felt dizzy within seconds.</p>\n<p>Other options to avoid motion sickness completely ruin the sense of virtual reality. They either confine you in dive goggles or make you move in a choppy manner, etc.</p>\n<p>No, masses are NOT going to want to adapt to this, at all. They're not us/you</p>\n<p>The future seems to lean more towards Augmented Reality, as hinted by Apple's headset. And then, in specific situations, enabling an immersive mode for watching content. Apple is not solving motion sickness but rather creating experiences that avoid it. </p>\n<p>Nevertheless, I appreciate Meta's efforts, but with their current trajectory and strategy, there's a long way to go before Mixed Reality becomes a reality.</p>\n<p>In my opinion, Apple's strategy is better, and will bring MR to the place we all want it to be\u2014create a super expensive headset that is spectacular, and people will be amazed. This will spark interest in Mixed Reality, and prices will drop in a few years.</p>\n<p>Meta makes a mistake by focusing on the wrong experiences. Apple gets it right; in their Vision Pro videos, everything is calm experiences because they know those are the ones that truly work.</p>\n<p>And of course, they've equipped the Vision Pro with impressive screens to astonish people with content playback and productivity, this is what will propel it to stardom.</p>\n<p>Designating a headset for mediocre games or games that make the masses dizzy is certainly not the key to success.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Certainly, augmented reality is the future. Moreover, you feel strange when you take off the headset and return to your normal reality without being able to interact. Especially when, instead of using controllers, you use your hands. Vision Pro is focusing exactly on that, not a coincidence.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>PS:  The part I liked the most about Assassin's Creed is the beginning, where you're on a call and have to solve a puzzle by moving around your house, but in augmented reality instead of virtual reality. Then it switched to virtual reality, and the immersion and enjoyment went downhill because it just looks really cheap and makes you dizzy.</p>",

It can even be viewed on 2D phones and tablets using your hand to separate the views of two eyes. I havn't used it, but I see other people reporting it works.</p>",
