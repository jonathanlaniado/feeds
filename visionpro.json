Here is my argument:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>For context, there are &lt;12k people on this sub and even less on the Discord. I'd venture that the Venn Diagram of early adopters willing to shell out this much money for a V1 of a product and those who use Reddit probably has a bit of overlap.</li>\n<li>The BASE PRICE is $3500, but there is little chance that's what you walk out the door paying. After sales tax, prescription lenses, and whatever other accessories Apple comes up with I'd be willing to bet the price tag is closer to $5k than to the $3500 for most people. That's a lot of disposable income, especially considering the impact of recent inflation on consumers.</li>\n<li>It's only a US release. My guess is that they restrict the purchases to those who are verified Apple customers who live in the US. I also wouldn't be surprised if they gave first crack to those who are registered in their developer community, as that is clearly their target customer.</li>\n</ol>",

A perfect buy for that purpose.</p>\n<p>I haven't used it for anything else because the videos look terrible, mostly due to bitrate/resolution issues rather than the Quest 2's screen/lenses. And most games are either garbage or make you dizzy.</p>\n<p>A few days ago, I got the Quest 3. While the lens clarity has improved significantly and the resolution is a little bit better, there's still an irreparable flaw: motion sickness. Additionally, video quality remains poor due to the lamentable content quality on Meta Quest TV. YouTube's app is also affected, and now there's a bug limiting the Quest 3 to a maximum quality of 1080s. In contrast, on the Quest 2 and Quest 1, you could easily watch videos at 4096s (that it's also not enough quality, pixels look like stones)</p>\n<p>The ability to consume content should be a top feature of the device since that's what attracts the masses (and Apple understands this well). However, Meta seems indifferent.</p>\n<p>But the worst part is the motion sickness. I tried Assassin's Creed Nexus VR that came out yesterday, set it to full immersive mode using the joystick for movement, and it was terrible\u2014I felt dizzy within seconds.</p>\n<p>Other options to avoid motion sickness completely ruin the sense of virtual reality. They either confine you in dive goggles or make you move in a choppy manner, etc.</p>\n<p>No, masses are NOT going to want to adapt to this, at all. They're not us/you</p>\n<p>The future seems to lean more towards Augmented Reality, as hinted by Apple's headset. And then, in specific situations, enabling an immersive mode for watching content. Apple is not solving motion sickness but rather creating experiences that avoid it. </p>\n<p>Nevertheless, I appreciate Meta's efforts, but with their current trajectory and strategy, there's a long way to go before Mixed Reality becomes a reality.</p>\n<p>In my opinion, Apple's strategy is better, and will bring MR to the place we all want it to be\u2014create a super expensive headset that is spectacular, and people will be amazed. This will spark interest in Mixed Reality, and prices will drop in a few years.</p>\n<p>Meta makes a mistake by focusing on the wrong experiences. Apple gets it right; in their Vision Pro videos, everything is calm experiences because they know those are the ones that truly work.</p>\n<p>And of course, they've equipped the Vision Pro with impressive screens to astonish people with content playback and productivity, this is what will propel it to stardom.</p>\n<p>Designating a headset for mediocre games or games that make the masses dizzy is certainly not the key to success.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>Certainly, augmented reality is the future. Moreover, you feel strange when you take off the headset and return to your normal reality without being able to interact. Especially when, instead of using controllers, you use your hands. Vision Pro is focusing exactly on that, not a coincidence.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>PS:  The part I liked the most about Assassin's Creed is the beginning, where you're on a call and have to solve a puzzle by moving around your house, but in augmented reality instead of virtual reality. Then it switched to virtual reality, and the immersion and enjoyment went downhill because it just looks really cheap and makes you dizzy.</p>",

Floor to ceiling life like video with your favorite artist. I also saw that Meta had <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZgav0w-6k0\">Meghan The Stallion concert in VR</a>.  Meghan being a pioneer in this, the video is 60K fps with 3d (Left and right) 180 VR. Reviews of the Meghan concert which also played in some VR theatres that people felt like Meghan was actually performing music inches away from them.</p>\n<p>Now Imagine this, you and your friends join you from anywhere in the world with their Vision Pro, you and your friends are in a private VR world, and then the concert begins. You get a personal concert up on the stage, face to face with your favorite artists and musicians and no random annoying other fans or people, just you and your friends and the artist.</p>\n<p>You don't have to deal with parking, you don't have to deal with large crowds, you can pause it for a bathroom and food breaks, you'll get engineer tuned audio and lighting. With the recent Taylor Swift tour, ticketmaster sold out in seconds and I heard some people paid as much as $20K to get a seat that was still pretty far away from the Concert. Imagine you get a front row, up on the stage. It feels personal like they invited you and your friends. You don't have to leave your living room and you can view at anytime. It's fully immersive and turns you living room into a concert.</p>\n<p>I can't wait and I hope they do this with many other artists and give an option for your friends to join too. (Note: I don't know if this will ever happen, but I hope it will)</p>\n<p>Edit: Also imagine Immersive 3d Music videos that you get to be in that don't look like crap (sorry a lot of 360 content isn't very good out there right now)</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>",

We can't wait to make this a reality! \ud83d\ude01</p>\n<p>For more regular updates you can also follow us on \ud835\udd4f: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SheetMusicVR\">x.com/SheetMusicVR</a></p></div>",

We are researching accessibility barriers that are created by virtual reality and augmented reality technology. The goal of our research is to figure out how we can make VR and AR hardware more accessible (the ethics approval for our research is 2023/352 and we also have linktree \u2013 linktr.ee/vrdisability). </p>\n<p>We are looking for people with disabilities who have tried AR and/or VR before to complete our survey and tell us about their experiences. </p>\n<p>The survey should take no longer than twenty minutes to complete, and if you don\u2019t want to or can\u2019t answer a question, all the questions are skippable.
