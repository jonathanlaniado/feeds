An app that allows you to view your sheet music in virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) environments.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/dkhojyjzc2rb1.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43569e64f385b3b8354826995b7fbcfa76f18586\">SheetMusicVR usage scenario</a></p>\n<p>While we're not quite ready for a public release, we'll open up an early beta program soon. Please head to our website at <a href=\"https://sheetmusicvr.com\">sheetmusicvr.com</a> and sign up for the waitlist to reserve your spot. The more subscribers we have, the more time we can allocate working on it and the faster we can get it in your hands! So please sign up!!! \ud83d\ude09<br />\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <a href=\"https://sheetmusicvr.com\">sheetmusicvr.com</a> &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>\n<p>This app idea has been floating around my head for quite a while. In fact, I asked 3 years ago what you would think about such an app: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/OculusQuest/comments/igytrw/shall_we_develop_a_vr_music_stand_app_for_the/\">reddit.com/r/OculusQuest/comments/igytrw/shall_we_develop_a_vr_music_stand_app_for_the/</a></p>\n<p>While it good quite a few upvotes, the most common concern was that it should be an AR app to allow users to see their instrument / surroundings and that the resolution might not be good enough for delicate music symbols.</p>\n<p>With the upcoming Meta Quest 3 and Apple Vision Pro, however, we felt that the time was finally ripe for this app! We can't wait to make this a reality! \ud83d\ude01</p>\n<p>For more regular updates you can also follow us on \ud835\udd4f: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SheetMusicVR\">x.com/SheetMusicVR</a></p></div>",
