My little brother was also with me. I gave him my phone and said him to call 112 ambulance and then open chatgpt. I said him to open the voice chat (I have premium ) and I tell the story and wanted help. GPT gave me instructions about the CPR and how to manage the problem I have. I was probably gonna do non stop massage in that time because of anxiety and fear but I have  learned that I should wait and listen sometimes etc.</p>\n<p>Ambulance came and took my father. He is alive. Doctor said I have saved him with proper hearth massage.</p>\n<p>I dont know what to tell. I usually use chatgpt for work and personal use but never ever felt something like this. It was life saving. I couldnt search that knowledge during that limited time in fucking Google. Probably would click on one Amazon link and buy some professional automatic hearth massager to delivered 2 days from now.</p>\n<p>edit: I think I should make it very clear that I don't recommend anybody to rely on instructions that AI generated while having dangerous issue like me. As I said I usually use GPT and I can confirm that it makes important mistakes. So I think it is not a good idea to rely only on GPT instructions. I just wanted to share my experience. I don't want to let someone get false information from AI in this kind of situations. Please prioritize calling emergency and asking help from people around you. It would be good idea to get information from GPT after you did the correct things.</p>",

GPTs are a new way for anyone to create a tailored version of ChatGPT to be more helpful in their daily life, at specific tasks, at work, or at home\u2014and then share that creation with others. For example, GPTs can help you learn the rules to any board game, help teach your kids math, or design stickers.</p>\n<p>Anyone can easily build their own GPT\u2014no coding is required. You can make them for yourself, just for your company\u2019s internal use, or for everyone. Creating one is as easy as starting a conversation, giving it instructions and extra knowledge, and picking what it can do, like searching the web, making images or analyzing data.</p>\n<p>Example GPTs are available today for ChatGPT Plus and Enterprise users to try out including Canva and Zapier AI Actions. We plan to offer GPTs to more users soon.</p>\n<p>https://openai.com/blog/introducing-gpts</p><div><br></div><img src=\"https://i.redd.it/d18rjdh51syb1.jpg\" />",

Then the other night I started reading a book about Arthur Shopenhauer which contains lots of information I'm unfamiliar with. </p>\n<p>I realized that instead of typing a question I could just speak it so I turned on voice chat and spoke my question. After it answered I realized, the voice chat stays on in listening mode for a long time. So basically I had chatgpt silently sitting by while I read my book. When a passage was particularly interesting I would read it out loud and quickly ask a question. and it would answer. </p>\n<p>We began talking conversationally about what I was reading in real time! It made the reading experience absolutely mind-blowing - such conversations are a great way to retain what you've read and make the subject matter more interesting. I would encourage any avid readers to try this. I mostly read non-fiction so I can't say how well it would interpret meaning in fictional content.</p>",

Currently I've got businesses in ecommerce, agency work, and affiliate marketing, and one undeniable truth remains: to truly scale by yourself, you need more than just sheer will. That's where I feel technology, especially AI, steps in.\n\nAs such, I wanted some AI tools that have genuinely made a difference in my own work as a solo business operator. No fluff, just tried-and-true tools and platforms that have worked for me. The ability for me to scale alone with AI tools that take advantage of GPT in one way, or another has been significant and really changed my game over the past year. They bring in an element of adaptability and intelligence and work right alongside \u201ctraditional automation\u201d. Whether you're new to this or looking to optimize your current setup, I hope this post helps. FYI I used multiple prompts with GPT-4 to draft this using my personal notes.\n\n# Plus AI (add-on for google slides/docs)\n\nI handle a lot of sales calls and demos for my AI automation agency. As I\u2019m providing a custom service rather than a product, every client has different pain points and as such I need to make a new slide deck each time. And making slides used to be a huge PITA and pretty much the bane of my existence until slide deck generators using GPT came out. My favorite so far has been PlusAI, which works as a plugin for Google Slides. You pretty much give it a rough idea, or some key points and it creates some slides right within Google Slides. For me, I\u2019ve been pasting the website copy or any information on my client, then telling PlusAI the service I want to propose. After the slides are made, you have a lot of leeway to edit the slides again with AI, compared to other slide generators out there. With 'Remix', I can switch up layouts if something feels off, and 'Rewrite' is there to gently nudge the AI in a different direction if I ever need it to. It's definitely given me a bit of breathing space in a schedule that often feels suffocating.\n\n## Echo.win (web-based app)\n\nAs a solopreneur, I'm constantly juggling roles. Managing incoming calls can be particularly challenging. Echo.win, a modern call management platform, has become a game-changer for my business. It's like having a 24/7 personal assistant. Its advanced AI understands and responds to queries in a remarkably human way, freeing up my time. A standout feature is the Scenario Builder, allowing me to create personalized conversation flows. Live transcripts and in-depth analytics help me make data-driven decisions. The platform is scalable, handling multiple simultaneous calls and improving customer satisfaction. Automatic contact updates ensure I never miss an important call. Echo.win's pricing is reasonable, offering a personalized business number, AI agents, unlimited scenarios, live transcripts, and 100 answered call minutes per month. Extra minutes are available at a nominal cost. Echo.win has revolutionized my call management. It's a comprehensive, no-code platform that ensures my customers are always heard and never missed\n\n# MindStudio by YouAi (web app/GUI)\n\nI work with numerous clients in my AI agency, and a recurring task is creating chatbots and demo apps tailored to their specific needs and connected to their knowledge base/data sources. Typically, I would make production builds from scratch with libraries such as LangChain/LlamaIndex, however it\u2019s quite cumbersome to do this for free demos. As each client has unique requirements, it means I'm often creating something from scratch. For this, I\u2019ve been using MindStudio (by YouAi) to quickly come up with the first iteration of my app. It supports multiple AI models (GPT, Claude, Llama), let\u2019s you upload custom data sources via multiple formats (PDF, CSV, Excel, TXT, Docx, and HTML), allows for custom flows and rules, and lets you to quickly publish your apps. If you are in their developer program, YouAi has built-in payment infrastructure to charge your users for using your app. \n\nUnlike many of the other AI builders I\u2019ve tried, MindStudio basically lets me dictate every step of the AI interaction at a high level, while at the same time simplifying the behind-the-scenes work. Just like how you'd sketch an outline or jot down main points, you start with a scaffold or decide to \"remix\" an existing AI, and it will open up the IDE. I often find myself importing client data or specific project details, and then laying out the kind of app or chatbot I'm looking to prototype. And once you've got your prototype you can customize the app as much as you want.\n\n## LLamaIndex (Python framework)\n\nAs mentioned before, in my AI agency, I frequently create chatbots and apps for clients, tailored to their specific needs and connected to their data sources. LlamaIndex, a data framework for LLM applications, has been a game-changer in this process. It allows me to ingest, structure, and access private or domain-specific data. \n\nThe major difference over LangChain is I feel like LlamaIndex does high level abstraction much better.. Where LangChain unnecessarily abstracts the simplest logic, LlamaIndex actually has clear benefits when it comes to integrating your data with LLMs- it comes with data connectors that ingest data from various sources and formats, data indexes that structure data for easy consumption by LLMs, and engines that provide natural language access to data. It also includes data agents, LLM-powered knowledge workers augmented by tools, and application integrations that tie LlamaIndex back into the rest of the ecosystem. LlamaIndex is user-friendly, allowing beginners to use it with just five lines of code, while advanced users can customize and extend any module to fit their needs. To be completely honest, to me it\u2019s more than a tool- at its heart it\u2019s a framework that ensures seamless integration of LLMs with data sources while allowing for complete flexibility compared to no-code tools.\n\n## GoCharlie (web app)\n\nGoCharlie, the first AI Agent product for content creation, has been a game-changer for my business. Powered by a proprietary LLM called Charlie, it's capable of handling multi-input/multi-output tasks. GoCharlie's capabilities are vast, including content repurposing, image generation in 4K and 8K for various aspect ratios, SEO-optimized blog creation, fact-checking, web research, and stock photo and GIF pull-ins. It also offers audio transcriptions for uploaded audio/video files and YouTube URLs, web scraping capabilities, and translation. \n\nOne standout feature is its multiple input capability, where I can attach a file (like a brand brief from a client) and instruct it to create a social media campaign using brand guidelines. It considers the file, prompt, and website, and produces multiple outputs for each channel, each of which can be edited separately. Its multi-output feature allows me to write a prompt and receive a response, which can then be edited further using AI. Overall, very satisfied with GoCharlie and in my opinion it really presents itself as an effective alternative to GPT based tools.\n\n# ProfilePro (chrome extension)\n\nAs someone overseeing multiple Google Business Profiles (GBPs) for my various businesses, I\u2019ve been using ProfilePro by Merchynt. This tool stood out with its ability to auto-generate SEO-optimized content like review responses and business updates based on minimal business input. It works as a Chrome extension, and offers suggestions for responses automatically on your GBP, with multiple options for the tone it will write in. As a plus, it can generate AI images for Google posts, and offer suggestions for services and service/product descriptions. While it streamlines many GBP tasks, it still allows room for personal adjustments and refinements, offering a balance between automation and individual touch. And if you are like me and don't have dedicated SEO experience, it can handle ongoing optimization tasks to help boost visibility and drive more customers to profiles through Google Maps and Search\n\n\\-----\n\n**P.S.** If you liked this, I've created a [free directory](https://aiscout.net/) with over **1500 AI tools** listed for almost any use case. It's updated daily and there's also a GPT-powered chatbot to help you find AI tools for your needs. Feel free to check it out if there's something specific you are looking for.<div><br></div><div><p>Being a solopreneur has its fair share of challenges.
