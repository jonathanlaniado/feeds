I've been pondering how it will impact the future. Let's be real, it won't replace everyone. If you got by in life by being good looking, AI won't replace you. I don't care how hot that silicone AI bot will be; a hot human will always be preferable. Who will it replace? I think the nerd ... that person who struggled in highschool but who found their way in the world by getting a job that required brainpower and paid well. Not amazingly well, but like a few hundred k.</p>\n<p>Nerds were the bottom rung of society for thousands of years. When society consisted of vikings and warriors we were nobodies. When society consisted of peasants and knights we were nobodies. When society consisted of tradesmen and seafarers we were nobodies. Remember that for the vast vast majority of history, simply being able to read and write was rare. There was little use for that skill so no one bothered to learn it.</p>\n<p>Note I'm not talking about the rare geniuses like the Teslas, Newtons, Einsteins ... I mean your run of the mill 120-140IQ nerd who could do an intellectually hard job well. The people who now become <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2023/03/14/gpt-4-beats-90-of-lawyers-trying-to-pass-the-bar/?sh=6a1ca8793027\">lawyers</a>, <a href=\"https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/mass-general-brigham-study-finds-chatgpt-4-excels-at-picking-the-right-imaging-tests\">radiologists</a>, <a href=\"https://www.the-sun.com/health/9079567/chatgpt-better-diagnosis-emergency-doctors/\">doctors</a>, <a href=\"https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/is-chatgpt-a-better-entrepreneur-than-most/\">MBAs</a>, <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/chatgpt-passes-cpa-exam-on-second-attempt-7501615\">accountants</a>, reporters, programmers, engineers ... We only started to gain worth when our brainpower and patience for tedium had value, during a brief period in the last century or, at most, two centuries. Now Sam Altman, Greg Brockman and Ilya Sutskever (all three of whom are clearly one of us) destroyed that one path we had to worth with their invention. Oh the irony.</p>\n<p>Of course these are just my thoughts and I wanted to get other opinions but that's where I'm leaning. Will AI return us nerds to a pre-modern age era where we were among the lowest group in society, because there was little use for our brainpower?</p>\n<p>Edit: If you could elaborate on your pick below it would be really helpful, especially if you picked \"another group.\" <strong>Also, if you have a different way of dividing up the population please share as I'm doing this to learn and discuss not to declare! (and also share which of your subgroups will be hurt most by AI).</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/poll/16txuxq\">View Poll</a></p></div>",

I am an adult. I understand why they would want to restrict bomb making instructions or sex chat. But if I want ChatGPT to talk to me like a gangster rapper that should be my own business. If I want it to swear like an italian mobster, that should be my choice. If I ask it if there is research that correlates autism and transgender people, i don't want a lecture on tolerance without answering my question. give me links to applicable research.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>maybe it makes them look bad? but if they have solid parental controls in place it wont. no journalist is going to pay it a credit card and then go out of their way to remove the filters in the settings and their write an outrage story about what happens. even if they do, no reasonable people will take it seriously.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>maybe they are worries that if people are constantly using it for adult themes it will fuck up the AI training? well then just have chat reply to any adult request with \"are you sure you want me to answer? my result may be offensive?\". if the user answers \"yes\", then the filter is removed for that response and training is disabled. if a person has to disable the filter in that way for every adult request it will do the same job without restricting the quality of the information we can get from the AI.</p></div>",
