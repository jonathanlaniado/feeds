Now I run Sonoma on both computers and I simply can't stand the System Preferences app. I still hate as much as day 1 and its absurd that we have an app that we don't even use. When I was using Monterey I could find most settings quickly, now finding something in the new Settings app is so time consuming we all keep using the search bar. The app right now is simply unusable. </p>\n<p>Its not just that it has a mobile UI (designed for a finger as an input method and not a mouse) and that its a copy paste from the iPad app, its also that the app has completely irrelevant stuff at the top and important settings at the bottom: who needs Notifications, Screen Time or Accessibility at the top, and TrackPad, Keyboard and Users at the bottom of the list? Someone who uses an iPad, not a Mac. Most settings are buried under menus (just like the Settings app on the iPhone, which worked well in 2010 but not anymore) and we just don't use it. I'm not asking for the System Preferences app from Monterey to come back (I wish it did but Apple never does that kind of stuff) but at least to get a redesign. I simply don't get how this awful design made it to production and how someone actually approved it. </p>\n<p>People say \"oh you'll adapt, people don't like changes\" but I still dislike it as much as the day it was released. Its quite possibly one of the most stupid decisions Apple has taken in recent years (just like redesigning the \"About this Mac\" page that now shows way less information and requires more clicks to see the same information as before)</p>",

Now I have read they I can make bootable mediums with different Mac computers, and the other Mac I have, is a MacBook Pro M2, which as you know, it uses the Apple silicon chip.</p>\n<p>Is there, or could there be anywhere to use the Mac Mini? \nI am also not really professional with Mac devices, so your help would be much appreciated!</p>",

For example, I previously bought programs such as Final Cut Pro For those who do the same job, paid or unpaid, 100 dollars a year is a very high wage for me, instead it is 130-140-150 dollars and it has a permanent license, just like the other programs I use. Unfortunately, 100 dollars is the cost of kitchen (food) for a family of 4 people in my country. That's why I can't pay this money for a software that I will use to listen to lectures at regular intervals. I'm open to your advice, thank you in advance for your help. \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude0a</p><div><br></div><img src=\"https://i.redd.it/kqiz13a7m8fc1.jpeg\" />",

This window manager is amazing. It's still in the development phase but in my opinion, it's already better than Yabai and Amethyst.</p>\n<p>It's much better than Yabai for users who don't want to degrade system security by disabling SIP. Also, there is no flickering like with Yabai and no problems with spaces because it is using virtual workspaces. Also, it has some heuristics to decide if a window should be floating or not so it's not as annoying as Yabai.</p>\n<p>Check it out!</p>\n<p>PS. I'm not associated with AeroSpace :).</p>",

I also just got a new 32\" 4K monitor, and while the native display scaling issue wasn't as bad as I first thought it would be, I began finding my eyes tiring rather easily when I was using my mac (I have both my Mac Studio and my gaming PC hooked up to both my monitors).  Got BetterDisplay, and after enabling near native HiDPI scaling - wow...what a difference. </p>\n<p>So grateful for the developer, to be honest, because it took what was a good experience with my new monitor, and made it a great experience. </p>\n<p>I just have one question? If this can be done with a third party app, why on earth does Apple not natively include this type of code in the system? it's SO much better than their native scaling.  I know they want to sell Studio Displays and Pro Displays, but for many those displays simply aren't a viable option. </p>",

Until Windows 10 no longer receives important security updates in a few years time, I have doubts that Windows 11 won't bring features back till then.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, I haven't used MacOS that much but I do commend MacOS in retaining its identity since the beginning.
