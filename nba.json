The expectation, from both that executive and others, is that Reaves ultimately will return to Los Angeles, which would cement Reaves' role as the long-term running mate next to Doncic in L.A.'s backcourt -- the role once held by Brunson then Irving in Dallas.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t think Reaves is ever going to be the level of player Irving or Brunson were/are. Just for context, James Harden makes $36M per year and was just All-NBA and helped lead the Clippers to 50 wins with Kawhi Leonard only playing in 37 games (half of those while he was on a minutes restriction). Could Reaves have done that? I\u2019m not so sure.</p>\n<p>Outside of his first playoff series in the 2022-23 season, Reaves has seen a significant drop statistically from his regular season averages. In the playoffs for the 2023-24 season and the 2024-25 season he was a cumulative -46 in his minutes on the court. </p>",

            "content_html": "<p>Michael Jordan is the highest-paid athlete of all time, earning a staggering $3.3 billion throughout his career, adjusted for inflation and mostly from off-court sources. But despite having a massive bank account, MJ once tried to save $40,000 cash instead of his daughter after their jet ski overturned in deep waters.</p>\n<p>Well, at least that's according to his son Marcus, who detailed the entire incident during the Spilling Family Secrets episode of the Separation Anxiety podcast, which the younger Jordan co-hosts with girlfriend Larsa Pippen.</p>\n<p>MJ first went for the cash</p>\n<p>According to Marcus, during a trip to Bahamas, his father took his 14-year-old sister, Jasmine, on a jet ski ride, but for whatever reason, the jet ski capsized and threw them into the ocean. The incident left MJ, Jasmine, and what Marcus described as a 'big wad of cash in a rubber band' literally floating on the open waters. Per Marcus:</p>\n<p><strong>\"My dad's in the water, my sister's floating a couple of feet away from him, and you see this wad of cash floating in the water. Who do you think my dad went for first? My dad literally went for the 40 grand first. My dad said, 'She got on a life vest, but I gotta go grab this cash.'\"</strong></p>\n<p>Marcus also told Larsa that his dad doesn't know how to swim, but even without a life vest at that time, MJ was still determined to save his hard-earned money, even doing it first over ensuring Jasmine's safety.</p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.basketballnetwork.net/off-the-court/michael-jordan-and-his-daughter-jasmine-fell-off-a-jet-ski-in-the-middle-of-the-ocean\">https://www.basketballnetwork.net/off-the-court/michael-jordan-and-his-daughter-jasmine-fell-off-a-jet-ski-in-the-middle-of-the-ocean</a></p>",

            "content_html": "<p>In late 1999, when he was 21, Bryant met the girl who would put an end to his bachelor days. Vanessa Laine, 16, aspiring model and high-school sophomore, was working as a background dancer in a Snoop Dogg video that was shooting at the same studio where Bryant was trying to film his own rap video. (For a brief moment, Bryant wanted a future as a rap star.) The two clicked immediately. \"He was into her,\" recalls Snoop.</p>\n<p>Soon, Bryant was picking up Laine at school in his black Mercedes and dropping her off in the mornings. (The teenager was living with her stepgrandfather at the time and had lots of freedom.) When TV news crews got wind of the romance, they regularly began flying helicopters over the Marina High campus in Huntington Beach, Calif., to get shots of the couple. The courtship caused such a stir that school authorities banned Bryant from coming near campus or attending any school events with her. Marina High officials declined to discuss the matter. \"It just set this bad example for the school and the kids, but Kobe didn't understand what the message was when he dropped her off early in the morning,\" says his friend Tonahill. Bryant's eventual answer to the problem was to pay for Vanessa to be home-schooled.</p>\n<p>As disapproving as school officials were, it was nothing compared with the disappointment of Bryant's family, who watched as Kobe became \"unnaturally attached\" to Vanessa, as one family friend put it. With her long, fire-engine-red fingernails and black lipliner, Vanessa had little in common with the successful young women Kobe had romanced in the past. The family thought she was too young and uncultured, and the fact that she wasn't black--Laine's mother is Hispanic and her father is white--didn't help. His teammates didn't know what to make of Vanessa, either. \"We all knew he got so attached to her because he needed a friend, someone to hang out with,\" says a fellow Laker. \"I'm not sure if it was love, or he was just happy that someone accepted him with no complaints. He didn't understand that she was a kid and she was in awe of him.\" When Tonahill asked Kobe what he saw in the 16-year-old, he responded, \"She's pure, and innocent, and not jaded by the world.\"</p>\n<p>Even though his family hoped the relationship was a passing fancy, in public they tried to be supportive, appearing at games with Vanessa and her mother and stepfather, and coming together at the end of the 2000 season to celebrate what would be the first of three consecutive championships for Bryant and the Lakers.</p>\n<p>But it didn't last. when Kobe proposed to Vanessa with a seven-carat diamond engagement ring and announced that she would be moving into the Pacific Palisades mansion, the family exploded, a person close to the situation said. They pointed out to him that Vanessa and her mother were spending a great deal of Kobe's money on Rodeo Drive, and that the Laine family was in tough financial straits. They pleaded with Kobe to take it slow, or at the very least to get a solid prenuptial agreement. It was a dicey subject to broach, given that Kobe's father, sisters and brother-in-law were all working for him in various capacities. Angered and insulted, Bryant withdrew.</p>\n<p>\"He was so torn by that situation, so upset about the directions he was being pulled,\" said Tonahill. It wasn't just his family who disapproved of the marriage. Laker coach Phil Jackson encouraged him to hold off for a few years. Reportedly, Michael Jordan and a couple of other athletes also made calls to Bryant suggesting that he take it slow, or at least get a prenup. \"He just said, 'I can make the money back',\" says a player who tried to advise him. \"He was like, 'She can have it, because I'm young and I don't see it ending like that way anyway'.\" His agent, Tellum, was so frustrated by Bryant's refusal to get a prenuptial agreement that he stopped representing him. In April 2001, Bryant married Laine in a small Catholic church in Dana Point. None of his family or teammates was there.</p>\n<p>Source: https://www.newsweek.com/kobe-court-138547</p>",

The loss was the nadir of Don\u010di\u0107\u2019s worst NBA season. For all the criticism of Don\u010di\u0107\u2019s body, until this past season, nobody could diss his body of work: He\u2019d never played fewer than 60 games in a season, and just a year earlier, he\u2019d powered the Mavs to the NBA Finals. No such luck in 2024. A calf injury knocked him out for all of January. Then Dallas sent him packing. Then came the 4-1 playoff series decimation at the hands of the Timberwolves. One day after that loss, Don\u010di\u0107 texted Seager to start his offseason training program ASAP. \u201cSo every summer I try my best to work on different things,\" he says. \"Obviously, I'm very competitive. This summer was just a little bit different, you know. It kind of motivated me to be even better.\u201d</p>\n<p>The early postseason exit gave Don\u010di\u0107 more than motivation. It granted him a full four months of rest. That\u2019s allowed him to work in lockstep with what he calls Team Luka, a trio of wellness specialists\u2014Barrio, Ma\u010dek, and nutritionist Lucia Almendros\u2014who he hired back in 2023, after the Mavs had missed the playoffs. Back then, he was a 24-year-old hunting for ways to take his game to the next level.</p>",

The NBA superstar has taken plenty of heat for his conditioning and physique over the years, but after a full summer of training and lots of protein, he\u2019s poised to take his game\u2014and the Lakers\u2014to another level.",
            "content_html": "<p>LUKA DON\u010dI\u0107 KNOWS that you\u2019re thinking he looks lean as heck now. That\u2019s because he\u2019s thinking the exact same thing.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s an early morning in July in a quiet town in Croatia, and the five-time NBA All-Star is alone on a private basketball court, working out with trainer An\u017ee Ma\u010dek, midway through a 90-minute session that blends weight training, agility work, and shooting drills. This is the first of the day\u2019s two workouts for the Los Angeles Lakers star in what may be the most pivotal season of his career, and he\u2019s doing it fasted, just as he\u2019s done for much of the summer. At the moment, he\u2019s driving to the basket, a thick resistance band strapped to his waist, pulling against him during every shot.</p>\n<p>The workout consists of a series of circuits, each set up to include an on-court challenge (like those resistance band lay-ups) and an upper-body and lower-body exercise. The facility, which is located in the town where Don\u010di\u0107 has vacationed every summer since he was a teen, didn\u2019t have weights until earlier this month when he had dumbbells, barbells, weight plates, and med balls trucked in. Now, Don\u010di\u0107 can do everything from trap-bar deadlifts to landmine overhead presses\u2014and he works through sprints and jumps on an outdoor track too.</p>\n<p>He moves swiftly from circuit to circuit, banging out hip stretches one moment, working through renegade rows the next. It\u2019s a session with barely any breathers, which is fine. This version of Don\u010di\u0107 doesn\u2019t need them. This Luka is\u2026different.</p>\n<p>You see it in the way his Jordan Brand jersey hangs loose, and in the new hints of definition on his arms. You see it in the complete absence of fatigue he shows when going from heavy Romanian deadlifts to dumbbell bench presses to lateral bounds\u2014one right after the other. And you see it in the way he smiles when he admits that he\u2019s noticed his sleek silhouette in the mirror. He subtly nods to his reshaped delts during our Zoom interview. And as he splays out his long-limbed physique on the bleachers in the gym, he seems relaxed, calmly making eye contact. His arms look longer today than usual, perhaps because he\u2019s just so downright skinny, a fact which now (finally!) he sheepishly acknowledges. \u201cJust visually, I would say my whole body looks better,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>And yes, somehow, in the world of sports, the way you look matters\u2014even though it shouldn\u2019t. From Nikola Joki\u0107 to Patrick Mahomes to Shaq, decades before all of them, we\u2019ve seen loads of evidence that athletic dominance comes in all shapes and sizes. But ask anyone to pick out an athlete in a crowd, and they\u2019ll almost always point to the dude with LeBron-size arms and Ronaldo-level abs.</p>\n<p>Don\u010di\u0107, still just 26 years old, is unquestionably a topflight athlete (more on that soon). But he\u2019s never quite looked the Greek god part. And somehow, that shortcoming too often has undercut his five All-NBA first team nods and his 82 career triple-doubles (already seventh all-time). Last August, critics blasted him for looking \u201cfat\u201d and \u201cout of shape\u201d during a charity game. The moment the Mavs traded him to the Lakers in February, rumors leaked that Dallas didn\u2019t want to deal with his love of beer and hookah. Even this summer, the NBA web has chattered that Don\u010di\u0107 is on Ozempic.</p>\n<p>What the Luka haters have never seen is this: Don\u010di\u0107 slogging through two-a-days in Croatia while sticking to a gluten-free, low-sugar diet that includes at least 250 grams of protein and one almond milk\u2013fueled shake a day. They never knew that Don\u010di\u0107 had quietly constructed a fitness team several years ago to help enhance his (very dangerous) natural gifts. And they never realized how much he committed to training and diet this summer.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s the thing too: Even if you thought Luka Don\u010di\u0107 had a dadbod, he was already a top-five NBA player. And after pushing hard this offseason, he can\u2019t help but wonder how high he\u2019ll level up. \u201cIf I stop now,\u201d Don\u010di\u0107 says of his effort to rebuild his body, \u201cit was all for nothing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/a65488151/luka-doncic-body-transformation/\">https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/a65488151/luka-doncic-body-transformation/</a></p><div><br></div><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0px; position: relative; padding-bottom: 125.0%;\"><iframe class=\"streamable-embed\" src=\"https://streamable.com/o/mdpnjm\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>",

            "content_html": "<p>On this particular day, Porter sat down with former porn star Lana Rhodes to talk about the impact of porn on society. Eventually, the conversation devolved into a tease about wild sexual adventures by NBA players.</p>\n<p>Rhoades waxed poetic about how porn and multiple sex partners creates a higher bar for men to be sexually aroused. She shared a couple of crazy stories.</p>\n<p>When she talked about one particular story involving a cookie, Porter over-shared about the stories floating around the NBA. And they involve gay sex with NBA players.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis happens in the NBA,\u201d Porter said. \u201cI hear wild stories about some of these dudes. And other celebrities. Their fetishes get so crazy\u2026 they might be a straight man but they\u2019ve done so much stuff with pretty girls, and they have so much access to pretty girls, that now they\u2019re over here messing with [trans women], or now they\u2019re over here messing with dudes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s crazy to think about. Obviously, I think the porn industry has a part to play with that.\u201d</p>\n<p>https://www.outsports.com/2024/4/24/24092357/michael-porter-jr-denver-nuggets-nba-playoffs-gay-sex-trans-women/</p>",
