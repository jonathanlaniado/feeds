No doubt, the Phoenix Suns deserve credit for their great year as well. In fact, they've already clinched the spot for most total wins (regular season + playoff) in this particular season. Utah led the regular season with 52, but Phoenix passed them in the playoffs and will hang on to that spot regardless of the outcome tonight, as they lead Milwaukee 63 to 61 in terms of total wins this year.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p><a href=\"https://www.basketballnews.com/stories/metta-world-peace-on-team-usa\">Source</a></p>\n<p><em>On the subject of international basketball, you played a season overseas and played under FIBA rules. We\u2019re about to start the Olympics with Team USA undergoing some changes. Bradley Beal is off the team. Kevin Love is off the team. Keldon Johnson and JaVale McGee joined the team. How do you see the Olympics playing out for Team USA?</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Metta World Peace: \u201cFor me, the Olympics is a bitter situation for me. I love the Olympics, and I feel like I\u2019ve been shortchanged. Even though I was a head case and a real volatile player when I did play, I just always felt like I should have had an opportunity to play [for Team USA]. The year I was going to play, I got suspended - and when you talk about legacy, that gold medal is very important to legacy. And I was a player, third-team All-NBA. I should have had a tryout. I remember when I didn\u2019t get called for the Olympics, and I thought at least I\u2019d play on the team that played against the people who got selected (the Select Team). And when that didn\u2019t happen, I called my agent and said, \u2018What the hell is going on here?!\u2019 And we could not get no response. So then, I had to call the Olympic office myself. And I got no return call. And I was like, \u2018Just let me try out.\u2019 I understand I wasn\u2019t the greatest player to be around at that time and some players did not want to play with me, but I was like, \u2018Give me a chance to take that player\u2019s spot.' At that time, in that era, my defense was so incredible, I was going to take someone\u2019s spot. I\u2019m 100 percent sure.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>That would have been the 2004 Olympics in Athens when the U.S. lost to Puerto Rico by 19 in the opener and ended up taking home the bronze.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Metta World Peace: \u201cYeah, you see what I\u2019m saying? We [wouldn\u2019t have] taken home a bronze. We\u2019d have a gold. I wasn\u2019t on that team. The USA had a goal in 2004 and there\u2019s no way we lose with me on that team. There\u2019s no way. How? I\u2019m averaging 24 and the best defender in the world at that point in time. I got Defensive Player of the Year in between sharks and blue whales, Ben Wallace and Duncan and Garnett. This is who I had to navigate through in order to get that award. Hall of Famers. With that being said, I understand why. But I just want people to hear: If I could rewind time, that is something that is supposed to be on my resume. Now, granted, a lot of things are not on my resume because of me, but I got Defensive Player of the Year, I was close to being MVP one year, I got champion, All-Star, everything but the Olympics. But I\u2019ve been to the Olympics in high school. I got the USA high school history. One day, I hope they pick me. Sometimes they pick veterans, they pick guys who don\u2019t play [anymore]. I hope I can play in the Olympics; I deserve it just as much as anybody, I believe. Some people would argue that other people deserve it also. That\u2019s true, but I am the one yapping about it. So hopefully one day an honorary jersey, end of the bench. I even told them I would get the water. I literally called the office. I told my agent, \u2018Can I even be the water boy? Something?\u2019 So every time someone brings up the Olympians, I rant, I rant I rant. I am an Olympian, for sure. I am an Olympian, a gold medalist, and I truly believe that.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen you look at it from a basketball standpoint, in terms of being that professional at that age, I wasn\u2019t. But I was a hell of a basketball player, and I felt like a hell of an American basketball player, one of the best American basketball players in the world. And although I\u2019m very much from Queensbridge and as urban as it gets in the NBA, at the same time I always wanted to represent the USA. And another reason why I wanted to represent the USA: Chris Mullin was an Olympian, I went to St. John\u2019s. Vern Fleming was a gold medalist Olympian, and Vern Fleming is from my neighborhood and everybody knows where I\u2019m from. Vern Fleming experienced all the things I talked about, just picture those situation with Vern Fleming, and he was an Olympian. He\u2019s from the same block, the same exact block as me. There\u2019s a lot of reasons why I wanted to be an Olympian. No matter what anybody says, I am an Olympian, I am a gold medalist. I didn\u2019t cut myself from that team.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>",

Harden is a former MVP, but he had only two guaranteed seasons left on his contract at the time of the trade. Portland could do even better because Lillard has four seasons remaining on his contract worth a grand total of $176 million. The long-term security in Lillard\u2019s contract could lead to more interest from teams and more return in a trade.</p>\n</blockquote>",
