Armstrong, 56, and the victim were in an argument when he hit the woman with a gun and threatened to shoot her, Dallas PD and sources told WFAA. </p>\n<p>According to jail records, Armstrong was booked into jail shortly before 7:30 a.m. Saturday on a charge of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. His bond was set at $35,000, jail records showed. Armstrong has since posted bond. </p>\n<p>WFAA reached out to the Dallas Mavericks and Armstrong for comment. </p>\n<p>The Mavericks sent WFAA the following statement Sunday afternoon: </p>\n<p>\"The Dallas Mavericks are aware of an incident involving a member of our staff and are gathering all relevant information surrounding the incident. We take this matter seriously. The employee has been placed on administrative suspension pending the outcome of legal proceedings. This matter is currently under review by the appropriate legal authorities. Due to this fact, we will allow the legal process to run its course and we will refrain from further comment while proceedings are ongoing.\"</p>\n<p>WFAA has not heard back from Armstrong as of publication. </p>\n<p>Armstrong is in the midst of his 10th season as an assistant coach after joining the Mavs during the 2008-2009 NBA season. Prior to starting his coaching career, Armstrong played in the NBA for 14 seasons, spending time with Orlando, New Orleans, Indiana, New Jersey and Dallas. The former basketball player earned the NBA\u2019s Sixth Man Award and Most Improved Player Award in 1999. </p>\n<p>In 2004, Armstrong was traded from New Orleans to the Mavericks and played 114 games, even appearing with the team in the 2006 NBA Finals. </p>\n<p>Source : https://www.wfaa.com/article/sports/nba/mavericks/darrell-armstrong-mavs-aggravated-assault-arrest/287-a2f55e2a-55df-42df-900f-bae1d92766c5</p>",

            "content_html": "<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Jordon\">Phil Jordon</a>, of Wailaki and Nomlaki descent, was the first Native American to play in the NBA. He spent just under two seasons with the Pistons from 1957-59 after being acquired from the Knicks. Although he was a solid big-man, he is perhaps best known for a game he <em>didn't</em> play in. Back with the Knicks in 1962, the 6'10 Jordon was sick with the flu (or hungover according to some claims) and unable to play in a game against Philadelphia and Wilt Chamberlain. The lack of Jordon's size in the lineup contributed to Wilt dominating for his historic 100 point game. Just three years later, the 31 year old Jordon drowned when the four person raft he was on broke apart in Puget Sound. His body was recovered from the water 20 days later.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonny_Dove\">Sonny Dove</a>, whose mother was part of the Mashpee Wampanoag tribe, was the second Native American to play for the Pistons. Detroit drafted him 4th overall in the 1967 draft - one spot ahead of Walt Frazier and three spots ahead of Pat Riley. Dove had an unproductive two years with Detroit before having a couple of successful seasons with the New York Nets in the ABA, only to suffer a broken leg in a bicycle accident that ended his career. His bad luck didn't end there though. After retiring from playing, Dove worked part-time as a college hoops commentator and as a taxi cab driver. At the age of 37, Dove was killed when he unknowingly drove his cab off the edge of a partially open drawbridge, plunging down into the highly-polluted water of the Gowanus canal.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bison_Dele\">Bison Dele</a>, born Brian Williams, chose to change his name prior to his final NBA season in order to honor both his Native American (Cherokee) and African roots. He spent the final 3 years of his career with the Pistons from 1997-99 as their highest paid player. With 5 years still left on his contract, he choose to retire at the age of 30 to instead pursue other adventures in life. Those adventures included buying a catamaran and sailing the Pacific Ocean. In 2002, Dele set sail from Tahiti along with his girlfriend, brother and skipper. His brother was the only one ever seen again. There was strong evidence that Dele's brother had shot and killed the other three people on the boat, attached weights to their bodies, and dumped them into the water. Dele was 33 years old when he disappeared at sea. His brother committed suicide before the case went to trial.</p>",
