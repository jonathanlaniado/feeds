There have been reports in recent weeks that Houston has interest in trading up with Detroit to take Cunningham, but the vast majority of speculation from other teams has centered on Green as the presumptive fit at No. 2. His ability to create his own shot gives him a chance to be a legitimate offensive fulcrum, and the Rockets are positioned to take a swing on upside. For what it\u2019s worth, Green\u2019s camp is thought to prefer Houston as a destination, rather than landing in Cleveland one pick later. Devin Booker\u2019s evolution from promising scorer into a well-rounded perimeter centerpiece provides a blueprint for Green\u2019s development, with his exceptional athleticism giving him major upside.</p>\n</blockquote>",
