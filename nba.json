The Sixers have stood firm that they don't necessarily want to move Simmons and are only open to trading him for one of the few players in a tier above Simmons, such as Damian Lillard, or James Harden before him. The Sixers still believe the dominant defensive pairing between him and Embiid can be the backbone of a 2022 title team. </p>\n<p>For that, dating back to those Combine dialogues, Philadelphia was adamant in its plans to withhold Simmons' pay for not complying with the terms of the five-year, $170-plus million agreement he signed in July 2019.

It\u2019s a stance that Irving has explained to close teammates. To him, this is about a grander fight than the one on the court and Irving is challenging a perceived control of society and people\u2019s livelihood, according to sources with knowledge of Irving\u2019s mindset. It is a decision that he believes he is capable to make given his current life dynamics. \u201cKyrie wants to be a voice for the voiceless,\u201d one source said.</p>\n<p>However, the nation\u2019s top doctors and science have cleared the vaccine as safe and effective. The Center for Disease Control (CDC), American Medical Association (AMA) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) state clearly that COVID-19 vaccines are effective at helping protect against severe disease and death, including from variants of the virus, while also being safe. In fact, multiple studies showed that 99 percent of people who are in intensive care units in hospitals are unvaccinated. Sources say 96 percent of NBA players are currently vaccinated. More than 3.75 billion people worldwide have received a vaccine dose. <strong>To be clear, Irving\u2019s stance is not believed to be anti-science, according to sources.</strong></p>\n<p>Rival teams believe the Nets would be open to a significant trade offer for Irving, but his openness to playing for other franchises is unclear. Irving will be fully eligible in all markets except New York City and San Francisco. Brooklyn is on a championship chase, wanting the commitment of every player on their roster, now dealing with the cloud of uncertainty regarding a member of its big three.</p>\n</blockquote></div>",

From the article by Jake Fischer, at Bleacher Report:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Simmons already received 25 percent of his salary for this season, the second of a five-year, $177 million agreement he signed back in 2019, and the October 1 payment was intended to be the subsequent installment of his pay.</p>\n<p>Philadelphia views Simmons\u2019 refusal to report to training camp as not fulfilling the terms of his contract. In dialogue with league-office personnel and players union officials, the Sixers appear to be within their rights to withhold that lucrative check. </p>\n<p>In turn, there have been growing whispers this week among NBA sources with knowledge of the situation that Simmons could respond by actually reporting to Philadelphia in the coming days, but maintaining that he is injured and unable to compete. Simmons has had noted knee and back injuries in the previous two seasons. </p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/jakelfischer/status/1444004600940572674?s=21</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For \u201cSeinfeld\u201d fans, this is in full Costanza/Play Now territory.</p></div>",

The rebels without a cause seem to be infatuated only with the sounds of their own voices, so they can call the rest of the world sheep for taking a life-saving vaccine.</p>\n<p>Anything that remotely looks like following of rules has become fodder for the anarchists who throw mol\u043etov c\u043ecktails into full buildings yet hide their hands when it\u2019s time to be accountable.</p>\n<p>\u201cBack is definitely against the wall,\u201d Wiggins told reporters at Warriors media day. \u201cBut I\u2019m just going to keep fighting for what I believe.

It\u2019s confusing, and I give them that,\u201d a head c\u043each told Yahoo Sports. \u201cEverything\u2019s not a c\u043enspiracy or a setup. It\u2019s not about 'I, I, I.\u2019 What about the people around you?\u201d</p>\n<p>The coach said his team\u2019s vaccinati\u043en rate is around the league average and if presented with a scenario of an unvaccinated player coming to him, unsure of what to do, he said: \u201cI\u2019d tell him what I know. When we were young, the flu sh\u043et was coming out and we took that. And I\u2019d ask, \u2018How can I help you be safe and others around you be safe?\u2019 I gotta trust you\u2019ll do the right thing. But that\u2019s a lot of trust.\u201d</p>\n<p>The graduates of Y\u043eu\u0422ube University and the brilliant historians who vacillate between favored phrases \u201c\u0422uskegee Experiment\u201d to \u201cD\u043eing my \u043ewn research\u201d appear to have very little knowledge of either \u2014 it\u2019s just used to shut up opposition, as if they\u2019re picking up a beaker, a syringe and some goggles any time soon.</p>\n<p>But in giving them the platf\u043erm, we\u2019re giving them what they want. They have access to the greatest d\u043ectors in the world and will c\u043ensult them for anything from the common cold to a torn-up knee, but they have apparently disc\u043evered something all the world\u2019s greatest scientists have missed.</p>\n</blockquote></div>",

Both the Nets and a spokeswoman for Irving declined to comment on the record about Irving\u2019s vaccination status, but Nets general manager Sean Marks was asked during a news conference on Tuesday whether New York City\u2019s mandate could sideline any of his team\u2019s players.</p>\n<p>\"Regarding if they could play today, I can't comment on who could play and so forth. There would obviously be a couple people missing from that picture,\" Marks said. \"I won't get into who it is, but we feel confident in the following several days before camp everybody would be allowed to participate and so forth.\"</p>\n<p>Earlier in the news conference, Marks said: \"I think we all understand what\u2019s at stake. We\u2019ve had very candid conversations. \u2026 We don\u2019t see whether it\u2019s a citywide mandate, or it\u2019s the league mandate to follow, being any sort of hindrance to us being able to put out a team.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<blockquote>\n<p>The league's memos, which also state that a player who misses games \"as a result of his inability to comply with local law might subject him to a reduction of his compensation by the NBA or his team,\" have changed some minds, according to league sources. </p>\n<p>But multiple agents have said in interviews that they\u2019re having trouble convincing their remaining holdouts. </p>\n<p>\"We work for the players,\" one said. \"And they all have different reasons. But if they\u2019re hell-bent on not getting it, there\u2019s only so much you can do.\"</p>\n</blockquote></div>",

Now, as the start of the 2021-22 season nears, the organization is dealing with an ongoing headache behind the scenes because Wiggins' stance has not changed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Wiggins has, to this point, decided against getting the vaccine, a league source told ESPN, confirming a San Francisco Chronicle report Wednesday night. This has put into question his availability for some games for the start of the season. As of Aug. 20, the city of San Francisco has required proof of vaccination for large indoor events.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Warriors declined to comment on Wiggins' situation late Wednesday night, citing player privacy protocols. In a statement to the Chronicle, the San Francisco Department of Public Health said it would not comment specifically on Wiggins' situation -- unless the NBA grants him a religious exemption.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"To each his own, really. Whoever wants to get it, can get it; whoever doesn't want to get it, don't get it,\" Wiggins said on March 22. \"Right now, I'm not getting it, but it's no knock on anyone else that's getting it. I make my own decisions. But right now, I decided not to get it.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Wiggins at the time said he was waiting for more information.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Yeah, I don't really see myself getting it any time soon, unless I'm forced to somehow,\" Wiggins said in March. \"Other than that, I'm good.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Chronicle reported that the Warriors put Wiggins in touch with an Oakland doctor to discuss the hesitancy in getting the vaccine, but he did not change his stance.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Full Article: <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/32261240/warriors-andrew-wiggins-remains-unvaccinated-source-says-jeopardizing-availability-golden-state\">https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/32261240/warriors-andrew-wiggins-remains-unvaccinated-source-says-jeopardizing-availability-golden-state</a></p></div>",
