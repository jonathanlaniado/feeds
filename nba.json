            "title": "[OC] The Bucks would be just the FIFTH title team in the modern era with no top-3 draft picks on the roster and just the SECOND champion with no top-9 picks",
            "content_text": "One of the most striking things about this Bucks roster is that none of their Big 3 were top 10 picks (Giannis was 15th, Holiday was 17th, and Middleton was 39th). In fact, the only top-10 pick on the roster is Brook Lopez (10th). This had me wondering: has such a team ever won the title? \n\nSo I set out on a little research mission today to better appreciate the rarity of this Bucks team and here\u2019s five interesting tid-bits I found (note: I\u2019m using 1977, the first post-merger season, as the start of the \u201cmodern\u201d era):\n\n1) Only 1 team has ever won the championship with ZERO top ten picks: the 2019 Raptors. Their highest drafted player? Kawhi at 15, who they acquired via trade. So, as always, shout out to that impeccably assembled Raptors squad. Legendary stuff from Masai. \n\n2) With a win, the Bucks would join the 2007 Spurs and the 2014 Spurs as the only champions with only one top-10 pick. For both those titles the Spurs had number-1-overall Tim Duncan\u2014 fair to say he was more important to his team\u2019s success than Brook is to the Bucks. Also, worth noting that that 2014 team also featured Kawhi, drafted 15th just like Giannis. It really pays off to find an MVP-level player outside the top-10, huh? If the Bucks can close out this series, their FO deserves to be ranked among the all-time greats like the Duncan-era Spurs. \n\n3) As the title says, with a win, the Bucks would become only the FIFTH team in the modern era to win a title with no top-3 picks on the roster. They would join the \u201819 Raptors, the \u201808 Celtics, the \u201883 Sixers, and the \u201879 Sonics. That means over 90% of champions since the merger have had at least one top-3 pick. Side note: God damn my Hornets need some more top-3 picks\u2026\n\n4) Another way to frame it is that the Bucks would be the second team ever to win the title with ZERO top-9 picks\u2014 admittedly, that sounds a little more cherry-picked. Nonetheless, that still offers an interesting perspective on the history of the league and on the rare feat the Bucks have a chance to achieve. \n\n5) So, if you didn\u2019t already know it, history shows that top-10 level talent is (almost always) key to winning NBA championships. Looking back at championship rosters really does highlight the value of top-10 (and ESPECIALLY top-3) draft picks. Obviously, not all of these players were crucial to their teams\u2019 championships, and not all of them were drafted by the teams they won rings with. This list is less a reflection on a given roster\u2019s talent-level, or an organization\u2019s drafting success, and more a reflection on the dominance of Blue Chip Talent across NBA history\u2014 and by extension, the rarity of a team winning it all without the help of a bonafide \u201cCan\u2019t Miss\u201d prospect on the team. It\u2019s an interesting list to analyze, so below is the complete list of the top-10 picks on every championship team (going back to 1977).

I sped up to get out of the way. As I looked back behind me, the car was gone, but, the minute I turned my head back to what was in front of me, it was too late. I ran over a tree branch that was in the road and my front wheel went haywire and threw me from the bike. I landed on my face, shoulder and hip. i got up immediately and walked about 100 yards back to my house in shock. When I got into the house I lost my breath and almost passed out.\"\nAllen's wife then took him to the hospital, where he was checked for internal bleeding and had X-Rays taken. All tests came bacck negative.\n\n>Allen noted that his injuries would have been much worse had he not been wearing a helmet, posting a picture of the scuffs on the side of his helmet. \n\n>\"My helmet saved me from a far worse fate. I didn\u2019t want to post this at first because no one wants to show their missteps in life, but as you get older, you learn that life isn\u2019t always about being cool or perfect. It is ok to be vulnerable! More importantly, I had to post this as a reminder for everyone to please wear your helmets when you ride,\" Allen wrote. \n\nI'm glad Ray is okay, especially considering what happened to Shawn Bradley and Mark Eaton.",

I just don\u2019t think I\u2019m very well-versed in (the analytics). We get our reports and some of the basic stuff I understand and implement...What I\u2019m excited about is there\u2019s going to be a different dimension we\u2019ll get from Kenny. You always have to be thinking about getting better, expanding your knowledge, your view...I interviewed Kenny during the playoffs, during their run. We talked about their series against Utah, against Phoenix. Hearing him discuss what was going on, break down the matchups, that was really impressive...he could bring the most of what I didn\u2019t have, what Mike Brown didn\u2019t have, what (Bruce Fraser) didn\u2019t have. There were some great candidates who were maybe a bit repetitive, people who were really impressive who maybe saw the game like us and didn\u2019t offer enough of a different view...One of the reasons we felt a change was necessary, we haven\u2019t really changed the staff for five years. I was worried about groupthink. We\u2019ve all been on this journey together. We\u2019ve seen our team. We know our team. Fresh eyes.\n\n> The developmental part of it is a dynamic of it. But I also see Kenny as a guy who can look at our core players, the guys who are already developed and give us some new ideas about how to use them. I\u2019d say those are the two components, improving our player development with new ideas, new ways of doing it, then thinking strategically how we might want to change on the court.\n\nBackground on the Hire: \n\n> The Warriors visited the Nets and Knicks in late October a few seasons ago...During some downtime, Steve Kerr and current front office member Nick U\u2019Ren decided to walk the bridge. Halfway across, they ran into Kenny Atkinson, the Nets head coach at the time, and his wife...That random encounter sparked continued dialogue between Kerr and Atkinson, via text, phone and occasionally in person. Kerr liked to pick his basketball brain.\n\n> \u201cVery clever. Very analytically driven,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of basketball conversations over the years and I\u2019ve always been impressed with the way he sees and feels the game. In a way, it\u2019s different from me.\u201d\n\n> Kerr\u2019s coaching staff underwent a significant shakeup this summer...Atkinson was employed and busy, a lead Clippers assistant in the middle of a playoff run and also a name being floated as a possibility for several of the league\u2019s head coaching vacancies. But the Warriors asked and were granted permission to interview him, Kerr did, ownership expressed a willingness to pay what was necessary and then they waited as Atkinson finished up the playoffs and explored his options.\n\nKerr Credits LA Clippers and Toronto Raptors for Allowing Their Staff (Kenny Atinkson & Jama Mahlalela Respectively) to Go After Opportunities Elsewhere:\n\n>First, I give Toronto and the Clippers a lot of credit (for giving permission). Not every organization is willing to let good people go. It\u2019s really up to each organization how you want to do it...It\u2019s such a fleeting opportunity in this league. Every staff, on average, probably gets fired every three years or so. I never understand when people don\u2019t allow someone to seek another opportunity. That\u2019s how we approach it and that\u2019s how Toronto and the Clippers did and I respect that.\n\nE: Adding the quote on why Kerr hired (or poached depending on how you look at it) Jama Mahlalela from the Raptors:\n\n>Incredible energy and organizational skills and leadership. Very organized. **I think one of the things that\u2019s happened in the league is we all now have like 12 coaches. It\u2019s very different for me now than it was seven years ago to manage my staff. Part of Jama\u2019s job is to manage the player development staff**, make sure everyone\u2019s on the same page. He\u2019s going to be doing a lot of organizational stuff and making sure everyone on that staff is doing well and really clicking together.",

            "content_text": "TL;DR:  be careful about crazy bets you make in college\n\nAbout 2 decades ago when I was I'm college, my friend from AZ who's a big Suns fan & I (Bulls fan) made a bet.  We bet that whoever's team won a title next would get a trip to Brazil paid for by the loser (we were both obsessed with Brazil and Carnivale at the time; marriage and kids since then for the both of us and neither of us have yet to visit).  We've been good friends the whole time, have been in each other's weddings, etc. even though for most of these years we've lived in different time zones.\n\nOnce the Suns beat the Clippers to advance to the Finals, he offered a chance to cash out early; I'd be off the hook for Brazil if I took him to a Finals game.  Once the schedule came out and I saw that Game 5 was on a Saturday (figured there wouldn't be a sweep), I luckily found a relatively cheap flight.  We made arrangements, got lucky again on Ticketmaster (as opposed to being at the mercy of scalpers, but still paid a hefty price), and saw my 1st ever Finals game in person.  \n\nGame 5 as all of you saw was insane.  My friend and 99% of the crowd were disappointed with the result (since I was there, I was rooting for the Suns to win that game, but I've been leaning towards the Bucks for the series), but know that we all got to witness something special.  Plus it's a lot easier justifying to The Wife a 24-hour trip to Phoenix vs. a trip to South America.",

            "content_text": "Thanks to his performance in this years finals, there's been a lot of discourse about Giannis, with the wide variety of hot takes and overreactions that come with every playoff series.\n\nSo with all the recency bias/prisoner of the moment takes, I decided to try to get some takes without *any* recency bias whatsoever - the very first takes and thoughts on Giannis on r/nba. \n\n**GIANNIS**\n\nThe very first mention of Giannis on March 26th, four months before he would get drafted: [\"I don't care who we draft in the first, I just want Giannis in the second. Kevin durant 2.0.\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1b0bji/2013_draft/c92kcbv?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) \n\nThe commenter seemed *very* set on drafting Giannis, also commenting [\"Ugggh the Thunder can't get Giannis, that's not fair.\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1etxwo/chad_fords_mock_30/ca3xun2?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) in a mock draft and commenting [\"giannis adetokunbo](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1eugrf/especially_for_all_the_avid_college_basketball/)\" in a thread about potential draft steals.\n\nAs weird as a comment comparing him to KD seems now, KD was a fairly common comp for his first few years when he was lanky, prior to him putting on the muscle he has today. \n\nFor further proof, here's another comment comparing him to KD from a mock draft two months before the real thing: [\"I really like Giannis' ability to run the floor. He also rebounds very well and plays above the rim. Explosive athlete. Young as hell too. Could develop a jumper and look at being a Kevin Durant-like international guy.\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1euzhs/here_is_my_first_round_2013_nba_mock_draft_rnba/ca40cgd?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) \n\nThe comment provides some more thoughts on Giannis, noting that with the possibility of Paul Pierce leaving \"he could be our (the Celtics) future\". In his mock draft the Celtics took him at 16 after the Bucks took Tim Hardaway JR instead of Giannis.\n\nI don't know how much truth there is to the statement \"Danny Ainge scouted him personally and believes he is a 6'10\" point guard\" but either way, comparisions to a point guard/forward were also common. \n\nHere's another now deleted comment calling Giannis a point forward: [\"Greek, 6 foot 9, 18 years old and can play the point. Has the size, athleticism, and ability(?) to potentially make waves a point forward in the NBA.\"](https://www.removeddit.com/r/nba/comments/1cy70d/2013_nba_draft_who_do_you_think_is_overrated_and/c9l5oac/)\n\nIn the same comment they also talk about Rudy Gobert, noting how he \"could be a beast in the NBA if he bulks up (a la Anthony Davis)\", and was also downvoted.\n\n**Some other early comments that have aged well:**\n\n [\"Doctors think Giannis isn't even done growing. He doesn't turn 19 until December. He could feasibly grow to 6'11.\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1nk7bv/milwaukees_lanky_big_three_have_a_combined/ccjcio5?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)  (exactly how tall he currently is according to Google)\n\nSome great in depth analysis on Giannis, if you want insight into what the most optimistic Bucks fans were hoping for from Giannis this is what you're looking for. [Finishes off with \"But, I\u2019m calling it here, Giannis is the next LeBron.\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1lmjac/20122013_30_teams_in_30_days_milwaukee_bucks/cc0pezd?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nDuring a mock draft [this user](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1fnklc/2013_rnba_mock_draft_15_picks_milwaukee_bucks/cac1zul?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) picks Giannis for the Bucks pick and another user replies to him [telling him that on the right team he could be a huge star someday.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1fnklc/2013_rnba_mock_draft_15_picks_milwaukee_bucks/cac9lny?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n[\"I could be reaching but I think Giannis Adetokunbo, in time will be great, or at least has the tools to ](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1flenu/which_of_the_less_fancied_players_in_this_years/cabkz5k?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)[be.\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1flenu/which_of_the_less_fancied_players_in_this_years/cabkz5k?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) (also said the same thing about Ricky Ledo but we won't talk about that).\n\nShoutout to Alex Kennedy for [suggesting him as a sleeper](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1gtrvo/this_is_nba_writer_alex_kennedy_ask_me_anything/canrbt6?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) (also along with Ricky Ledo for some reason?) to have the best career out of the players in the draft.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'll probably do another one like these for Middleton looking back on how everyone viewed the Bucks/Pistons trade, otherwise let me know if there's another player you think would be fun to view early mentions/first takes on.",

Both players have shown impressive growth during their first two seasons in New Orleans, but their futures with the team have come into question due to the financial limitations the squad may be facing with a Zion max extension potentially looming in the near future.  \n>  \n>I\u2019ve been bullish in my stance that Ball can be a great fit next to Williamson and Ingram as a 3-point threat and a playmaker in the open court. But as our Shams Charania recently reported, it\u2019s tough to see New Orleans committing a huge contract to a player who has yet to prove he can be one of the three best players on a consistent winner. Ball may have a bright future, but it wouldn\u2019t be wise for the club to tie up so much of their financial future without seeing this group actually win anything.\u00a0  \n\n>Hart\u2019s skill set as a versatile defender and willing scorer on the perimeter makes him a sensible long-term fit in New Orleans. But there\u2019s also a chance he may want to be in a situation where he\u2019s given more opportunity to be a consistent starter and offensive threat.\u00a0  \n\n>Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams are two veterans who were brought in to fill in the holes as essential role players last season, and they both ended up having fairly disappointing seasons. Sources say there\u2019s an expectation that at least one of them will be on the move this offseason, with hopes of adding more depth to the roster. It\u2019s unclear how much New Orleans would be willing to give up to make sure a trade happens involving either one of them. As tough as it may be to move some of these pieces around, I would be completely floored if the Pels try to roll out the same starting five next season.  \n\n> Say the Pelicans find a home for Adams into a team\u2019s cap space, and then stretch Bledsoe. That opens up approximately $30 million in cap space for New Orleans. Basically, they could get up to around $45 million-plus in cap space if they find a real player in free agency willing to come to New Orleans. They absolutely should not make those calls until they know that they can get the guys they\u2019re looking for in free agency. But the Pelicans should be genuine players at the max level, offering just about anyone who fits with their core. Even if they wanted to re-sign Ball at something like a four-year, $80 million contract, the team could still have around $25 million in space in this scenario.\u00a0",

            "content_text": "[Source](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ted-lasso-nba-coaches-11626232223)\n\n>Utah Jazz coach Quin Snyder needed some help dealing with a tricky situation at work not long ago. He took advice from one of his favorite television shows. \n\n>\u201cI don\u2019t know if you watch \u2018Ted Lasso,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cBut sometimes your favorite animal is a goldfish because it has a memory of 10 seconds. That\u2019s where we need to be.\u201d \n\n\n>There was something curious about one of the NBA\u2019s brightest minds borrowing a Ted Lasso pep talk. He could have leaned on decades of experience to get his basketball team past a stressful moment in the playoffs. He decided to invoke the folksy wisdom of a fictional American football coach managing an English soccer club. \n\n>It turns out he\u2019s not the only person in professional sports channeling his inner Ted Lasso these days.\n\n>\u201cIt should be required watching for coaches,\u201d Snyder said. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n>The model for modern coaches evolving from Lombardi to Lasso is a reflection of the shifting power dynamics in sports and how much has changed in management strategies over the past decade. Not every coach is relentlessly cheerful or comes to the office with freshly baked cookies for his boss. But it\u2019s hard to look around the business world and not see hints of Jason Sudeikis\u2019s character. \n\n>\u201cI think it used to be an accepted leadership tactic to essentially abuse people,\u201d said Brendan Hunt, one of the show\u2019s creators and writers who also plays Coach Beard, Lasso\u2019s sidekick. \u201cI\u2019m sure there are people who are, like, Now we\u2019re soft. We\u2019re not soft. We\u2019re just not morons. We see better ways to get the best out of people. Humiliating them in front of their peers is probably not high on the list.\u201d \n\n>Tyranny is out. Empathy is in. Coaches are getting the most of players by relating to them, not dictating to them, while keeping them accountable without coddling them. They are behaving more like Ted Lasso. \n\n>There is a takeaway from the series, now in its second season on Apple TV+, that applies to any line of work: The best coaches are the best managers of people.\n\n>It doesn\u2019t matter that Lasso doesn\u2019t know anything about the sport. What happens on the pitch is the least demanding part of his job. He soothes the neuroses of his star players. He injects his role players with confidence. He uses his superpower of emotional intelligence to balance competing personalities, foster an environment where everyone is capable of good work and build the culture of a team initially resistant to his charms. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n>The show found an early supporter in someone else who believes that winning should be fun, Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr, who tweeted his praise for the series when most people were ready to dismiss it. He also has another reason to be a fan: One of his children happens to work at \u201cTed Lasso.\u201d\n\n>\u201cIf there is a lesson on the show, it is that culture beats scheme,\u201d Kerr said in an email. \u201cThe guy knows nothing about soccer but he has created a great atmosphere with the club that leads to winning.\u201d \n\n>Chris Paul was binging the show between film sessions as the overachieving Phoenix Suns made the NBA Finals. Meanwhile his coach sounded like he was interviewing for Lasso\u2019s staff as he discussed the bond he\u2019s developed with his players. \u201cWhen they make fun of me,\u201d Monty Williams said, \u201cthat\u2019s a sign that we\u2019re tight.\u201d \n\nI'm glad to see Ted has fans in the NBA",

Especially impressive watching Holiday in [slow motion](https://streamable.com/vhp207) time his strip to make sure he starts with ball and makes it clean. Many players would not have the discipline to time it properly and would have reached early and committed a foul.\n\n>Holiday (MIL) strips the ball from Booker (PHX). As Booker turns to expose the ball, there is incidental contact to his arm during the steal, which is not what dislodges the ball. ([Video](http://official.nba.com/last-two-minute-report/?gameNo=0042000405&eventNum=2334))\n\nAlso notable is that they deemed Booker's [reach on Middleton at 1:47.9](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/omisnu/highlight_middleton_fouled_by_booker_with_under_2/) an incorrect non-call, which was basically the [same play he did](https://youtu.be/ZUVtWZPmQvQ?t=29) on Holiday at the end of Game 4 (I have seen arguments about that not being a foul either due to it occurring in the low block). Both should have been fouls.\n\n>Booker (PHX) places a hand to Middleton's (MIL) opposite hip on his drive and affects his SQBR before he is able to reach and dislodge the ball. [(Video)](http://official.nba.com/last-two-minute-report/?gameNo=0042000405&eventNum=2325)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn my opinion the officiating in this series has been pretty rough, though Game 5 was *mostly* good. I'm just happy that so far, bad calls have not affected the outcome of the games (at least how I think what the outcome should be).",
