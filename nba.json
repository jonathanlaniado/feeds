Cade is an unathletic bust, Scottie Barnes is the next Scottie Pippen, and probably one or two Kevin Knox strays here and there as well.</p>\n<p>As frequent as the overreactions is the flood of people who come in screaming \"Summer League doesn't matter, REMEMBER TRAE YOUNG!!???\" </p>\n<p>So if you're a new or old NBA fan, you might be asking yourself, what can I even get out of watching summer league? </p>\n<p>I wrote a small guide a couple of summers ago that I think is still relevant. I've updated it with current examples for the post below. I'm also linking the original post so you can all clown me for things I said that aged like milk. I hope you all enjoy.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/cblgoj/oc_so_if_playing_well_or_poorly_in_summer_league/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/cblgoj/oc_so_if_playing_well_or_poorly_in_summer_league/</a> </p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><strong>Disclaimer: I am far from an expert. But I\u2019m a tape and tactics junky who has dabbled in some VERY LOW level coaching. If you are a very experienced X/O basketball fan, most of what I\u2019m saying will be obvious. Hell most of it is logical anyway. But hopefully even ya\u2019ll can get something out of this, and please feel free to chime in with thoughts and suggestions (or disagreements!) to help everyone get the most out of their summer league experience</strong></p>\n<p>I love summer league. Besides the first week of Free Agency, it\u2019s the best part of the offseason. Watching everyone from highly touted young players, to low level G-League long shots is an exciting and high stakes event. And while many top players often sit out, they are only a small part of what makes summer league fun. Summer league has just started, and so my examples are only from short spurts of watching on Day One, so look out for examples moving forward.</p>\n<p>The problem is, we still don\u2019t really know what we can learn from summer league. Is it predicative of season performance? Can we learn if players will be good NBA players?</p>\n<p>The first thing to understand is that the answer to those questions has usually been a pretty resounding \u201cno\u201d. Playing well in summer league does not mean you will play well in the NBA. Similarly, performing poorly in summer league is far from a death sentence. And yet, part of summer league, outside of total performance, can actually be incredibly helpful to understand if the player will make an impact during their rookie year, so long as you don\u2019t forget the context in which a player is playing. (Rookie, some NBA experience? 19 years old or 22 years old? These things are always important to keep in mind.)</p>\n<p>So what do we look for in summer league that can be relevant to the players career?</p>\n<p>The key to understanding summer league is that we are looking predominantly at a few traits, which mostly cannot be found in a box score. These traits can be predicative of <em>early</em> NBA success. They are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Does the player understand the feel of the NBA game</li>\n<li>Does the player possess projectionable NBA skills</li>\n<li>Does the player have a repeatable and efficient shooting form</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Each of these can be strong indicators of whether the player can have early value in the NBA. <strong>It is important to note that because these players are so raw, this can tell you a lot about their immediate value. It will tell us much less (if anything at all) about their long term value. Players improve or regress</strong> It is also important to not live at the summer league box scores. Because of the tiny sample size, and differing levels of experience, and over relevancy of teammates, stats really don\u2019t give us a particularly good summer league picture. So put your statistics, both advanced as well as basic, aside for the time being and let\u2019s dive into some skill evaluation.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s get into the big 3:</p>\n<p><strong>Does the player understand the feel of the NBA game</strong></p>\n<p>The NBA operates predominantly as a spread offense league. Spacing is valued, attacking the basket becomes critical, and a mid-range game (not necessarily shooting, but occupying that space as a roller/facilitator/cutter) and most importantly the pick and roll, becomes a staple of most league offenses. On defense, NBA teams play comparatively very little zone over the course of the season  (I know, I know Raptors/Mavs fans. I'm just saying in comparison to some other leagues.) They have extremely complex, help heavy schemes that require quick rotations. These are waaay more complex than anything these players have seen before (with the partial exception of guys who have played high level Euroleague ball, or in certain other overseas leagues. Lookin at you Alperen) Most colleges and many international teams don\u2019t have the same style of play as the NBA. (exceptions like the old Dribble Drive Motion Kentucky Offense have given prospects from UK an advantage during summer league and during their initial NBA seasons. But even those pro style offenses are far from the choreographed dance combined with improv, that define modern NBA offense and defense)</p>\n<p>Watch for prospects that seem to understand NBA movement. Look for shooters who move with the ball to create passing lanes on the dribble drive (When the Wizards get going, watch for Kispert and for the Magic Franz Wagner here. Last night Nesmith couldn't hit a damn thing, but moved really well with the ball. Grimes looks fun too even if he may not enough to stick in the league.) The guys who understand that when a player drives baseline, you either cut weakside, crash to the corner for the spot up, or find space elsewhere, they often retain these skills in the NBA. Similarly, if a player is NOT moving with the dribble drive, that\u2019s a red flag.</p>\n<p>Look for ball handlers in the pick and roll. Get excited about the big ball handlers who can make plays in space and use their size for finishing and passing over the defense. (Cade had some excellent moments here as well as some disappointing moments. Cade showed some of the same concerns as he had in college last night. Looking forward to seeing how he develops over these few games). For smaller ball handlers, do they know how to change speed, attack, keep defenders on their back, and finish over length. (Shariff Cooper is so far ahead of the game on understanding where guys are and how to engage defenders at weird angles, but is really struggling for daylight finishing.) Defensively, are guards dying on picks or are they staying with the play? Are bigs hedging hard every time, or are they dropping low, or do they get caught in the middle (no man\u2019s land)?</p>\n<p>Ask yourself, are the players moving well away from the ball? Or do they just stand there besides a cut here and there? Do they end up running into other players on drives? Do they get in the way of their teammates attacking the rim? (This is a big one for rookies. Players attack the basket so quickly in the NBA, rookies frequently forget to get out of the way.) How are players finishing? Athletes should be leveraging their ability to finish above or around the defense. If they aren't that's a red Are smaller and less athletic players finding ways to avoid the defense by being clever? Maybe that means fakes. Maybe it\u2019s misdirection of which hand or side of the rim they will finish on. Creativity is one of the most important things to look for. Does a player react well and make plays when the offense goes bad (especially look for clever passing and timely off ball cutting, and steals on defense). Do players stay close to their man on defense, or do they lose them off ball because they get caught ball watching? (Jalen Green has deliciously tantalizing potential but is still a classic ball watcher who has some tunnel vision on D.)</p>\n<p>If you are watching closely, you will see a hilariously clear difference between players with NBA experience and those who are young rookies. (Look at, for example, the difference between Payton Pritchard and Theo Maledon, vs. someone like Tre Mann. The NBA experience really makes a difference.)</p>\n<p>One last bonus piece: Do they play fast? Are they decisive? So many players catch the ball and think about what they are going to do with it. They ball stop like crazy. If your name is James Harden or LeBron James, ball stop all you damn please. But if you are going to be a productive NBA role player, you need to be used to immediately dribbling, passing or shooting as soon as you get the ball. The NBA is a game of inches and milliseconds. You can\u2019t give up any advantage. The all time great at this is Iguodala. Dude knows what he wants to do 15 seconds before anyone else on the court. He fidgets as he waits for the ball, seeing an opening that isn\u2019t there yet, and immediately attacking so that as soon as an opportunity to pass, or drive or screen presents itself, he\u2019s already there. In my original post a few years ago I said \"One player who did this so well in summer league and then went on to continue doing so in the NBA is Kyle Kuzma. One of the first clues that he was going to succeed was how quickly he played, attacking closeouts, and using defender\u2019s momentum against them.\"  This didn't age so well, but it did give a good indicator on a player who made an early impact.</p>\n<p><strong>Does the player possess projectionable NBA skills</strong></p>\n<p>How is the player\u2019s ball handling in small spaces? Especially for the bigger players, summer league is a great opportunity to see them handle the ball on the break. Watch the PnR in particular. Do guards keep the ball low? Do they have a high dribble frequency? Do the players slide their feet well on defense? Watch closely for player footwork, both offensively and defensively in the post and on the wings. Do they close out with good form, chopping their feet and staying low as long as they can as they reach the shooter? Do they trip over themselves in the post? Are they getting turned around? (Rui I love you but we gotta get those issues ironed out) These are some of the questions to ask because those are skills that directly translate to the NBA immediately. If a guy is good at boxing out and playing big on the boards, he\u2019s probably going to be pretty damn good at it in the NBA. Check the box outs. Do they play big? Are they physical? When they roll on cuts or after screen, do they create a wide powerful passing target with their shoulders? (Unsurprisingly, Sengun is excellent at creating a wide target and recognizing angles to leverage his otherwise just above average frame. He's one of the most instinctive rebounders I've seen in years. Evan Mobley, while an excellent player, is still very unrefined with little things like these. Also Jeremiah Robinson Earl is an absolute treat to watch move around the court. He so swift in his movement, and is constantly in the right spot.)</p>\n<p><strong>Does the player have a repeatable shooting form</strong></p>\n<p>This is of course, related to the previous trait, but it\u2019s so important and unique it deserves its own category. Shooting is quite possibly the most important part of the NBA. And we can get a great look at it with summer league. Here is the catch: <strong>DO NOT FOCUS ON SHOOTING PERCENTAGE</strong> Summer league is not long enough, and features too many variables to make shooting data reliable. I'm a stats head, but 5 thrown together games of players who have never played together just isn't so helpful. Instead, look at the players shot mechanics. The biggest red flag? The release speed. If a player wants to be a good shooter in the NBA, they almost always need a quick release. They won\u2019t be able to get their shot off otherwise. (One excellent example of a guy the jury should still be out on is Jalen Johnson. An excellent game yesterday, but he had some awkward releases on a few of his shots. If he can really knock down from range in a fluid motion from the catch the way he occasionally showed last night, then the other parts of his game can really come alive. That's a story to watch for this week.)</p>\n<p>Are shooters shooting in a compact way? Are big men able to catch smoothly and go into their shot in one motion? Do players shooting off the dribble gather well as they transfer the ball to their shooting pocket? Are elbows being kept tight, and does anyone have a hitch in their shot? You can succeed with atypical shot mechanics (Someone put in that \u201cHiiii Kevin\u201d thing from SpongeBob, but with KD instead.) but it\u2019s certainly less likely, so it\u2019s something worth watching.</p>\n<p>So there ya go. It\u2019s just a small amount of the many things worth watching in summer league, but hopefully if you were wondering to yourself \u201cWell if being good or bad in summer league doesn\u2019t matter, how can we learn anything?\u201d this can hopefully be a partial answer to that question. There is so much to watch for when we view young prospects, tons of which can give us insight into how they will preform as rookies. I'd love to hear peoples thoughts on what they've seen from summer league yesterday, which players have stood out, and what skill sets they have demonstrated.</p>\n<p><strong>TL:DR</strong> **Summer league can tell you a lot about how players will play in the NBA. It won\u2019t tell you if they will be successful or not, but if you watch these things, you can spot early red flags or areas of promise that will often transfer over to the NBA regular season. Don\u2019t worry about stats. Don\u2019t worry about performance. Watch skill development and see how they adjust to NBA style offense and defense. It is my belief that if you do so, you can have a more fulfilling and productive summer league watching experience.**</p></div>",

From the very start of Morey\u2019s tenure in Philadelphia the organization was almost singularly-focused on monitoring the James Harden situation in Houston, according to sources both inside and out of the organization. Since the Sixers\u2019 season ended the team has similarly kept a watchful eye on the status of Lillard in Portland.

What made Iguodala\u2019s salary dump to Memphis so difficult to stomach was that he and the Warriors weren\u2019t ready for it. Iguodala might not occupy the same rung in franchise lore as Curry, Thompson or Draymond Green, but he had done enough to end his career in a Golden State uniform.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>-</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Over the past 25 months, as he forced his way out of Memphis without playing a game for the Grizzlies and adjusted to the Heat\u2019s more regimented culture, Iguodala texted with Curry about golf, offered Myers book recommendations, complimented Green on his weight loss and ribbed Klay for, well, being Klay. When Iguodala announced his return to the Warriors in a New York Times story published Friday morning, he made sure to shout out the team\u2019s director of operations, Eric Housen, and assistant video coordinator Jacob Rubin.</p>\n<p>A source close to Iguodala told The Chronicle that Iguodala would\u2019ve been at peace with retiring this summer. But when the Warriors called this week and offered him one last season with the franchise that has come to feel like family, he couldn\u2019t resist a chance at a storybook ending.</p>\n</blockquote></div>",

He played college basketball for the Michigan Wolverines and declared for the NBA draft after his junior season for the national runner-up 2012\u201313 team.

The game flows so much better - with teams focusing on fluid ball movement as opposed to isolation scoring. I have never seen basketball be played in such a beautiful way - apart from the 2014 Spurs. The refs are almost too reluctant to blow the whistle. Very rarely do you see players foul hunting for ridiculous calls (looking at you Harden + Trae). Overall, the international rules need to be adopted by the NBA. It would vastly improve their product and make for a better viewing experience.</p></div>",

When faced with the prospect of losing Alex Caruso, the 27-year-old guard whose Bird rights they carried and could thus pay whatever they wanted, they didn't put up any free-agency fight en route to him agreeing to a four-year, $37 million deal with Chicago. According to a source with knowledge of the situation, Caruso's camp went back to the Lakers after the Bulls made their offer and were told that there would be no counter.  </p>\n<p>Considering the many roster holes that remain around the LeBron James/Anthony Davis/Russell Westbrook superstar trio, with only the taxpayer midlevel exception ($5.9 million) and minimum-salary slots at their disposal, it's quite a surprise to hear they didn't make a more spirited push -- or any push, really -- to hold onto Caruso. Forget the part about him being a fan favorite -- that only matters, well, to the fans. But on this team that had such a strong defensive identity, he had grown into a very strong perimeter defender and a valuable rotation player (21 minutes per game in the regular season; 20.1 in the first round against Phoenix).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I have honestly have no idea WTF the Lakers are doing considering he was our best  defender and we have zero way to replace him. Not doing everything to maximize LeBron's last years is stupid as fuck.</p></div>",

A man of action, the saying goes. When there is no shot, he will create one. When there is no path to the basket, he will find one -- through sheer force of will or chutzpah.</p>\n<p>So in the summer of 2019, while the rest of the NBA world fretted over who reigning NBA Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard would choose between the Toronto Raptors and his hometown Los Angeles Lakers or LA Clippers, Westbrook was coming up with a plan to collaborate with him on a homecoming.</p>\n<p>Westbrook had become a father of three the previous November, and while he'd made a home and carved a Hall of Fame legacy in Oklahoma City, the chance to live and play in Los Angeles, where grandparents and his large extended family and friends could visit every day, held deep appeal.</p>\n<p>Teaming up with Leonard would be the fastest way there, so he placed the call, according to multiple sources. But Leonard didn't just take the call as one native son of Los Angeles to another, ponder it and file it away.</p>\n<p>He used it.</p>\n<p>According to multiple sources, Leonard then called Westbrook's teammate in Oklahoma City, Paul George, and told him he'd rather team up with him on a homecoming.</p>\n<p>George had always longed to play in front of his family as well but had formed a close bond with Westbrook in their two seasons together in Oklahoma City and was content to stay.</p>\n<p>Leonard's call upended all of that, though. And within a week, Leonard was teaming up with George -- not Westbrook -- for their hometown LA Clippers.</p>\n<p>While Westbrook began a journey that would take him to three new teams over the next two seasons, each time moving farther from both the NBA championship he'd been chasing his whole career -- and his hometown of Los Angeles. But he never gave up hope of fulfilling those goals.</p>\n<p>His longtime agent Thad Foucher helped guide him through each of those massive trades, which seemed independent of each other until you consider the previously unknown prologue between Leonard and Westbrook, which began the entire chain of events and now looms as a delicious subplot to all future Lakers-Clippers games.</p></div>",

From a free market angle, LeBron will always be underpaid due to the salary cap, but he's a billionaire so nobody should cry for him. And from a cap perspective, AD is on a crazy good contract assuming he can stay healthy(5 yr(s)/$189,903,600). </p>\n<p>For comparison, <a href=\"https://www.spotrac.com/nba/philadelphia-76ers/ben-simmons-20206/\">Ben Simmons</a> signed a 5 year / $177,243,360 rookie contract extension in Summer '19 that kicked in last season. However AD has more flexibility w/a 24/25 ETO, while Ben is locked in through the 24/25 season.</p></div>",

That means no trades for 2021 draft picks can be made official after 3:00 PM ET until the draft officially starts.</p>\n<p>In other words: commence hat silliness after 3:00 PM ET!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I agree with KOC, it's weird having guys wear hats from teams that traded them lol</p></div>",

Despite being regarded as a weaker USA team, they were still led by 2 MVPs in Tim Duncan and Allen Iverson.</p>\n<p>Despite the proclamations from r/nba that \"world fucked\", Team USA appears to be very much beatable, having dropped exhibition games to Australia and Nigeria and now a real one to France. Of course, those that follow international basketball knew the USA was vulnerable when they finished <a href=\"https://www.nba.com/news/team-usa-postmortem-world-cup\">7th</a> at the 2019 FIBA World Cup.</p>\n<p>USA still plays the Czech Republic and Iran, both of which are guaranteed wins. The top teams in other groups <em>(Australia, Spain, Slovenia)</em> will almost certainly try to tank games to avoid the possibility of playing USA in the first round, as the group winners and 2nd place finishers in each group are randomly paired for the knockout stage.</p>",

It also won the extreme respect of their American teammates.</p>\n<p>\"I have a lot of respect for those guys for not only committing to do this but actually keeping their word,\" Team USA forward Draymond Green said. \"You're talking about three true professionals, three extremely competitive guys that wouldn't be on their way here if this didn't mean something.\"</p>\n<p>As the American team got together to watch NBA Finals games during training camp in Las Vegas and after flying to Japan, they speculated about the possibility that one or more of the three might beg off after such an extreme turnaround. But all three repeatedly stood by their commitment. On Friday afternoon, Booker took a plane from Phoenix and Middleton and Holiday, less than a day after their championship parade, took one from Milwaukee.</p>\n<p>They met up at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, not as the competitors they were for the previous two weeks, but as teammates. After refueling, they got on the long-range plane for a nine-hour trip across the Pacific through the night.</p>\n<p>\"We could've very easily got to the last game ... and Devin Booker saying, 'Man, we lost, I'm pissed off, I'm out,' or Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday saying, 'We just won a championship, I want to celebrate and stay home with my family, I'm out,'\" Green said. \"It's on us to make sure that we do our parts to make sure they're rewarded with what they ultimately came here for, which is to help us to compete and win a gold medal.\"</p>\n</blockquote>",

Giannis came into practice once, scowling and grunting. \u201cThis is my new thing,\u201d Giannis told his teammates.</p>\n<p>They ignored him. Laughed a bit. But Giannis insisted on impressing them: He flexed his muscles after bench-pressing and flashed his scowl again, hoping his teammates would appreciate the intensity of his grunt. \u201cBro,\u201d Brandon Knight told him, \u201cyou still don\u2019t have any muscles. Relaaaaax.\u201d</p>\n<p>Giannis\u2019s teammates found it hilarious when he\u2019d attempt the scowl after a dunk, something he started doing toward the end of his rookie season. The first time he did it, against the Pistons, he ran back to the other end of the court with so much aggression even Caron Butler was surprised. \u201cI didn\u2019t know where the hell that came from,\u201d Butler says, laughing.</p>\n<p>Afterward, his teammates asked him, \u201cWhat is that? Where\u2019d you get that from?\u201d They assumed he\u2019d learned the scowl from YouTube\u2014where he learned everything in those days.</p>\n<p>Giannis laughed. \u201cOh,\u201d Giannis said casually in a \u201cthis old thing?\u201d kind of tone, \u201cI took it from Westbrook.\u201d</p>\n<p>Giannis\u2019s scowl seemed out of place. Manufactured. \u201cWe\u2019d be like, \u2018Oh, he must have practiced that at home today,\u2019\u201d Knight says. The scowl was coming along, but it still wasn\u2019t loud enough, mean enough. Convincing enough. \u201cYou gotta work on your roar,\u201d Knight would sarcastically advise Giannis. \u201cYou gotta work on your yell. We gotta get you right, man.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Lmfaoo this is amazing</p>",

            "content_html": "<p><a href=\"https://www.basketballnews.com/stories/metta-world-peace-on-team-usa\">Source</a></p>\n<p><em>On the subject of international basketball, you played a season overseas and played under FIBA rules. We\u2019re about to start the Olympics with Team USA undergoing some changes. Bradley Beal is off the team. Kevin Love is off the team. Keldon Johnson and JaVale McGee joined the team. How do you see the Olympics playing out for Team USA?</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Metta World Peace: \u201cFor me, the Olympics is a bitter situation for me. I love the Olympics, and I feel like I\u2019ve been shortchanged. Even though I was a head case and a real volatile player when I did play, I just always felt like I should have had an opportunity to play [for Team USA]. The year I was going to play, I got suspended - and when you talk about legacy, that gold medal is very important to legacy. And I was a player, third-team All-NBA. I should have had a tryout. I remember when I didn\u2019t get called for the Olympics, and I thought at least I\u2019d play on the team that played against the people who got selected (the Select Team). And when that didn\u2019t happen, I called my agent and said, \u2018What the hell is going on here?!\u2019 And we could not get no response. So then, I had to call the Olympic office myself. And I got no return call. And I was like, \u2018Just let me try out.\u2019 I understand I wasn\u2019t the greatest player to be around at that time and some players did not want to play with me, but I was like, \u2018Give me a chance to take that player\u2019s spot.' At that time, in that era, my defense was so incredible, I was going to take someone\u2019s spot. I\u2019m 100 percent sure.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>That would have been the 2004 Olympics in Athens when the U.S. lost to Puerto Rico by 19 in the opener and ended up taking home the bronze.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Metta World Peace: \u201cYeah, you see what I\u2019m saying? We [wouldn\u2019t have] taken home a bronze. We\u2019d have a gold. I wasn\u2019t on that team. The USA had a goal in 2004 and there\u2019s no way we lose with me on that team. There\u2019s no way. How? I\u2019m averaging 24 and the best defender in the world at that point in time. I got Defensive Player of the Year in between sharks and blue whales, Ben Wallace and Duncan and Garnett. This is who I had to navigate through in order to get that award. Hall of Famers. With that being said, I understand why. But I just want people to hear: If I could rewind time, that is something that is supposed to be on my resume. Now, granted, a lot of things are not on my resume because of me, but I got Defensive Player of the Year, I was close to being MVP one year, I got champion, All-Star, everything but the Olympics. But I\u2019ve been to the Olympics in high school. I got the USA high school history. One day, I hope they pick me. Sometimes they pick veterans, they pick guys who don\u2019t play [anymore]. I hope I can play in the Olympics; I deserve it just as much as anybody, I believe. Some people would argue that other people deserve it also. That\u2019s true, but I am the one yapping about it. So hopefully one day an honorary jersey, end of the bench. I even told them I would get the water. I literally called the office. I told my agent, \u2018Can I even be the water boy? Something?\u2019 So every time someone brings up the Olympians, I rant, I rant I rant. I am an Olympian, for sure. I am an Olympian, a gold medalist, and I truly believe that.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen you look at it from a basketball standpoint, in terms of being that professional at that age, I wasn\u2019t. But I was a hell of a basketball player, and I felt like a hell of an American basketball player, one of the best American basketball players in the world. And although I\u2019m very much from Queensbridge and as urban as it gets in the NBA, at the same time I always wanted to represent the USA. And another reason why I wanted to represent the USA: Chris Mullin was an Olympian, I went to St. John\u2019s. Vern Fleming was a gold medalist Olympian, and Vern Fleming is from my neighborhood and everybody knows where I\u2019m from. Vern Fleming experienced all the things I talked about, just picture those situation with Vern Fleming, and he was an Olympian. He\u2019s from the same block, the same exact block as me. There\u2019s a lot of reasons why I wanted to be an Olympian. No matter what anybody says, I am an Olympian, I am a gold medalist. I didn\u2019t cut myself from that team.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>",

Despite that, its the very first comment including him whatsover on r/nba so it earns a place here.</p>\n<p>The first comment actually <em>focused</em> on Middleton is from two weeks before the draft, where what I assume was a Thunder fan comments on a post asking about what player they think their team will draft: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/v5ix1/who_do_you_think_your_team_will_draft/c51n4e6?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">\"We really need someone who can come off the bench for KD who is an actual SF. Not a tweener, but a swingman. </a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/v5ix1/who_do_you_think_your_team_will_draft/c51n4e6?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">I'm thinking Khris Middleton from Texas A&amp;M. He appears that he would fit pretty well in this system.\"</a></p>\n<p><strong>AFTER THE DRAFT</strong></p>\n<p>The first mention of him after the draft is someone confused about <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/vqrxl/game_thread_2012_nba_draft/c573ozl?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">\"Why Khris Middleton with Doron Lamb, Tyshawn Taylor, and Darius Miller still on the board?\"</a></p>\n<p>In case you're wondering about the fate of those players, Doron Lamb was waived in 2014 and is playing basketball in Europe, Tyshawn Taylor was used by legendary Mavs coach Jason Kidd to get a free timeout by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEqU7JHkfu0\">bumping into him</a> and then waived, and Darius Miller was infamously a walking TPE, although probably the best player out of the three.</p>\n<p>Some more serious draft analysis had him pegged as <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/vsvmf/can_someone_post_this_insider_draft_grades/c57bun6?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">\"a smooth scorer with a great midrange game\"</a>. It's a nice read and seeing the optimism about MKG was a blast of nostalgia.</p>\n<p><strong>THE TRADE</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1jdllz/knight_middleton_and_krastov_to_be_traded_to_the/\">The trade thread</a>.</p>\n<p>To sum up the comments in a nutshell - the name Middleton is mentioned six times and half of those are jokes about Kate Middleton.</p>\n<p>If you ever needed proof Middleton was a throw-in in the trade here it is. Pretty much all of the discussion being had is about Knight/Jennings, although there are a few takes that have aged alarmingly well.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1jdllz/knight_middleton_and_krastov_to_be_traded_to_the/cbdm1b7?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">\"I have a feeling this one is gonna bite the Pistons in the ass.\"</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1jdllz/knight_middleton_and_krastov_to_be_traded_to_the/cbdu1l3?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">\"I think the steal of this trade might have been Khris Middleton. He had flashes last year as a rookie in limited minutes, and if the Bucks learned anything from losing Tobias Harris, it's gonna be to play their youngsters like John Henson and Khris very heavily to see what they are truly capable of.\"</a></p>\n<p>Funnily enough the person who made the comment, /u/noworldforeric also had <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1euzhs/here_is_my_first_round_2013_nba_mock_draft_rnba/ca40cgd?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">a great take on Giannis</a> that ended up in my last post as well, what a visionary. Wonder if we'll be seeing any other takes from him later on in this series...</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1jdllz/knight_middleton_and_krastov_to_be_traded_to_the/cbdmg9i?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">\"Middleton is gonna be dope, I wonder if Bucks will figure that out\"</a></p>\n<p>Aside from that, the thread is just discussion about the Pistons so unless you're in the mood for takes about the Pistons that have aged terribly I wouldn't recommend going through it.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><strong>Some takes around the trade that have aged well</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1jkqp2/is_it_possible_for_both_teams_to_win_the/cbfx4ip?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">\"As a Pistons fan, you should be more excited about the extra pieces in this trade than BK.</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1jkqp2/is_it_possible_for_both_teams_to_win_the/cbfyej8?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">Middleton could be the best player out of this entire trade. He has a shit on of \"Arron Afflalo\" potential. He's a guy Pistons fans were very excited about.

So basically just BK and 2 guys who won't make the Bucks roster.\"</a></p>\n<p>Funnily enough, once again both these takes are from a user that also featured in my Giannis post <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1fnklc/2013_rnba_mock_draft_15_picks_milwaukee_bucks/cac9lny?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">who predicted that he would be a huge star</a>.</p>\n<p>Honestly I'd say this is the perfect example of how much luck goes into these predictions. Someone with one of the best takes on Giannis also had terrible takes on Middleton, just because of how variable and random trying to predict the potential/ceiling of a player is.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1jtpea/brandon_knight_and_khris_middleton_pose_in_front/cbiwype?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">\"I honestly don't know how Middleton made to the NBA.

Either way first part is just weird given he was on the watchlist for the Wooden Award in college and unanimous addition to the All-Big 12 team.</p>\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> An explanation from /u/nibbinoo8 and /u/BEE_REAL_ :</p>\n<p>Deandre Jordan also went to Texas A&amp;M and was seen as a complete disappointment, but managed to be a great player anyways, so he was suggesting that there was a chance Middleton would have a similar career path. </p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1jlyth/what_move_has_your_team_made_in_the_past_few/cbg7nwz?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">\"I loved that trade. We didn't give up any picks or expiring contracts, and Middleton and Kravstov weren't going to do much of anything. It was effectively a straight up Knight for Jennings trade, and Knight's super turnover prone. Sure, Jennings is immature, but he's still an upgrade over what we had before. It's like Joe D's brain is finally working again\"</a></p>\n<p>Well uh, he was right about Kravstov I guess?</p>\n<p><strong>NEXT UP</strong></p>\n<p>The next players I'll be doing (in order of appearance according to requests) are Jokic, Draymond, Steph, Gobert and then finally a brief compilation of meme/fan favourite players like Caruso and Tacko.</p>\n<p>Any other suggestions/feedback are welcome!</p>",

There have been reports in recent weeks that Houston has interest in trading up with Detroit to take Cunningham, but the vast majority of speculation from other teams has centered on Green as the presumptive fit at No. 2. His ability to create his own shot gives him a chance to be a legitimate offensive fulcrum, and the Rockets are positioned to take a swing on upside. For what it\u2019s worth, Green\u2019s camp is thought to prefer Houston as a destination, rather than landing in Cleveland one pick later. Devin Booker\u2019s evolution from promising scorer into a well-rounded perimeter centerpiece provides a blueprint for Green\u2019s development, with his exceptional athleticism giving him major upside.</p>\n</blockquote>",
