Armstrong, 56, and the victim were in an argument when he hit the woman with a gun and threatened to shoot her, Dallas PD and sources told WFAA. </p>\n<p>According to jail records, Armstrong was booked into jail shortly before 7:30 a.m. Saturday on a charge of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. His bond was set at $35,000, jail records showed. Armstrong has since posted bond. </p>\n<p>WFAA reached out to the Dallas Mavericks and Armstrong for comment. </p>\n<p>The Mavericks sent WFAA the following statement Sunday afternoon: </p>\n<p>\"The Dallas Mavericks are aware of an incident involving a member of our staff and are gathering all relevant information surrounding the incident. We take this matter seriously. The employee has been placed on administrative suspension pending the outcome of legal proceedings. This matter is currently under review by the appropriate legal authorities. Due to this fact, we will allow the legal process to run its course and we will refrain from further comment while proceedings are ongoing.\"</p>\n<p>WFAA has not heard back from Armstrong as of publication. </p>\n<p>Armstrong is in the midst of his 10th season as an assistant coach after joining the Mavs during the 2008-2009 NBA season.

The former basketball player earned the NBA\u2019s Sixth Man Award and Most Improved Player Award in 1999. </p>\n<p>In 2004, Armstrong was traded from New Orleans to the Mavericks and played 114 games, even appearing with the team in the 2006 NBA Finals. </p>\n<p>Source : https://www.wfaa.com/article/sports/nba/mavericks/darrell-armstrong-mavs-aggravated-assault-arrest/287-a2f55e2a-55df-42df-900f-bae1d92766c5</p>",

            "content_html": "<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Jordon\">Phil Jordon</a>, of Wailaki and Nomlaki descent, was the first Native American to play in the NBA. He spent just under two seasons with the Pistons from 1957-59 after being acquired from the Knicks. Although he was a solid big-man, he is perhaps best known for a game he <em>didn't</em> play in. Back with the Knicks in 1962, the 6'10 Jordon was sick with the flu (or hungover according to some claims) and unable to play in a game against Philadelphia and Wilt Chamberlain. The lack of Jordon's size in the lineup contributed to Wilt dominating for his historic 100 point game. Just three years later, the 31 year old Jordon drowned when the four person raft he was on broke apart in Puget Sound. His body was recovered from the water 20 days later.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonny_Dove\">Sonny Dove</a>, whose mother was part of the Mashpee Wampanoag tribe, was the second Native American to play for the Pistons. Detroit drafted him 4th overall in the 1967 draft - one spot ahead of Walt Frazier and three spots ahead of Pat Riley. Dove had an unproductive two years with Detroit before having a couple of successful seasons with the New York Nets in the ABA, only to suffer a broken leg in a bicycle accident that ended his career. His bad luck didn't end there though. After retiring from playing, Dove worked part-time as a college hoops commentator and as a taxi cab driver. At the age of 37, Dove was killed when he unknowingly drove his cab off the edge of a partially open drawbridge, plunging down into the highly-polluted water of the Gowanus canal.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bison_Dele\">Bison Dele</a>, born Brian Williams, chose to change his name prior to his final NBA season in order to honor both his Native American (Cherokee) and African roots. He spent the final 3 years of his career with the Pistons from 1997-99 as their highest paid player. With 5 years still left on his contract, he choose to retire at the age of 30 to instead pursue other adventures in life. Those adventures included buying a catamaran and sailing the Pacific Ocean. In 2002, Dele set sail from Tahiti along with his girlfriend, brother and skipper. His brother was the only one ever seen again. There was strong evidence that Dele's brother had shot and killed the other three people on the boat, attached weights to their bodies, and dumped them into the water. Dele was 33 years old when he disappeared at sea. His brother committed suicide before the case went to trial.</p>",

But the news leak that Fox is now on the market was also, sources say, a strategic step by the Kings and Fox to navigate the NBA's Brave New CBA World.</p>\n<p>\"In this league, I expect the unexpected,\" Fox explained Wednesday, after the news broke, to the Sacramento Bee's Chris Biderman. \"I think crazier things have happened.\"</p>\n<p>Reports also pointed to San Antonio as Fox's preferred destination.</p>\n<p>\"For sure, I think everybody has a preferred destination,\" Fox told Biderman. \"I think everybody has a preferred destination if they're not in the place that -- or if they're not going to be in the place where they are in the moment. I think it's natural.\"</p>\n<p>It's natural for players to have a preference for where they might land next, even when under contract. It's rooted in recent history, too, where players' preferred landing spots have often become de facto fiats. </p>\n<p>But that instinct of relying on the player-empower-movement -- and therefore springing their demands on their teams whenever they please -- may very well be a part of the past, and, sources say, a factor in the timing of floating publicly that Fox could be moved.</p>\n<p>One source said Fox and his agent, Rich Paul, had, in effect, given the Kings a courtesy heads up so they have the time to get a deal done that satisfies everyone. The source said that means the Kings could well trade Fox before Thursday's deadline, but only if they get the right deal.</p>\n<p>They also said it's just as likely Sacramento waits until the summer if it thinks that allows it to get more for Fox.</p>\n<p>But a league executive who has had dealings with Paul, the founder and CEO of Klutch Sports, said that's only part of what's going on.</p>\n<p>The larger reality, he said, is that Paul grasps how the new CBA will take away much of the power and my-way-or-the-highway thinking that NBA superstars have grown accustomed to wielding.</p>\n<p>\"It's harder and harder to trade these big salaries, and the teams that have the apron room to take these big deals are limited,\" the executive said. \"So Rich is thinking, and saying [to the league], 'Before you use up your apron room to get Jimmy Butler, make room for De'Aaron.'\"</p>\n<p>This executive pointed out, and several others later reinforced, that the landscape of the NBA has shifted so much that the old business-as-usual won't be usual, or similar, anymore. And that many players, Fox notwithstanding, haven't yet come to terms with the new reality.</p>\n<p>CBS Sports' Sam Quinn pointed out last summer that this was coming. Paul appears well aware of what's happening, and has savvily begun adjusting accordingly.</p>\n<p>But many players, and agents, are in for a rude awakening, sources say.</p>\n<p>Prime example of the moment: Jimmy Butler.</p>\n<p>\"Rich doesn't want to wake up next fall, and suddenly De'Aaron is ready to move, and there aren't teams that can get him because of their apron status,\" the executive said. \"Or there aren't teams that can do it that his client wants to go to. For him it's, 'If I'm going to get this for De'Aaron, even if it's not today, I need to get us as much runway as possible.' </p>\n<p><strong>\"The players used to have all the leverage to leave. Now they don't. And the players association hasn't done a good job explaining that to them, in part because the NBA players association doesn't want to say, 'We did a bad job negotiating, and the deal we agreed to has destroyed the leverage you were so accustomed to having.'\"</strong></p>\n<p>The Fox chatter, then, was floated in part as a flare for the rest of the NBA, a message that says: Before you spend your very limited cap room on Butler, or anyone else, know Fox is here and can be had now, or down the road.</p>\n<p>It's simple supply and demand. There are just as many players out there who are going to want to move with big contracts in tow, but the new CBA means there will likely be fewer possible buyers.</p>\n<p>\"These players are used to saying, 'I want to get moved,' and they get moved,\" a former GM said. \"They don't understand yet, or haven't accepted, that with these new aprons we've basically created a hard cap. And the goal and the consequences is limiting player movement. Philly had to basically scrap its entire roster to get [Paul George].\"</p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/rich-paul-wants-deaaron-fox-rumors-out-now-and-timing-shows-how-players-have-lost-leverage-with-nbas-new-cba/\">https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/rich-paul-wants-deaaron-fox-rumors-out-now-and-timing-shows-how-players-have-lost-leverage-with-nbas-new-cba/</a></p>",

Fur real.</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cI may or may not have convinced [Steph Curry] to get a cat\u2026 It\u2019s sort of a cool community. Like a cool cat community. We just kind of keep it in-house. You\u2019ve got to knock a couple times for us to let you in. Secret code.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA lot of guys are dog people, but just the energy [and] the way I talk about them, the pictures and videos and stuff that I show them, it just gives them a little bit more interest,\u201d Poole says of his NBA peers. \u201cSo I give them a different perspective. Maybe they\u2019re not as much maintenance, but they\u2019re still a really dope companion and friend to have. You don\u2019t have to really take them out three or four times a day. You can still get your rest. Normally [my peers] like to explore it. I\u2019ve had a lot of friends and teammates who are also cat people.\u201d</p>\n<p>Other NBA players are openly pro-cat. Miami Heat rookie Kel\u2019el Ware has one. Indiana Pacers big men Myles Turner (who even styles himself in cat shirts) and James Wiseman do as well. Also, Utah Jazz wing Keyonte George: \u201cElite, elite basketball player. Extremely skillful,\u201d Poole says. \u201cHe\u2019s also a cat dad.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<blockquote>\n<p>And recently, Tristan Vukcevic, his Washington Wizards teammate, adopted a cat at PetSmart. When Dawn Wallace, the executive director of Lost Dog &amp; Cat Rescue Foundation, tells Poole that she heard he inspired Vukcevic to become a cat guy, a Wizards staffer leans over and whispers to me, \u201cMore like made him.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>",

Also said that he hadn't surpassed Kobe and Duncan yet. <a href=\"https://www.si.com/nba/2016/10/20/lebron-james-charles-barkley-all-time-top-five\">Source</a> </p>\n<p>Then in 2017, LeBron controversially said publicly that the Cavaliers need to acquire another playmaker. Barkley didn't hold back in his response:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Inappropriate. Whiny. All of the above,\" Barkley said of James last week. \"The Cleveland Cavaliers, they have given him everything he wanted. They have the highest payroll in NBA history. He wanted J.R. Smith last summer, they paid him. He wanted [Iman] Shumpert last summer. They brought in Kyle Korver. He's the best player in the world. Does he want all of the good players? He don't want to compete? He is an amazing player. They're the defending champs.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>LeBron was asked about these comments and boy, it seemed like he was waiting for a chance to let it out.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>He's a hater. What makes what he says credible? Because he's on TV?</p>\n<p>I'm not going to let him disrespect my legacy like that. I'm not the one who threw somebody through a window. I never spit on a kid. I never had unpaid debt in Las Vegas. I never said, 'I'm not a role model.' I never showed up to All-Star Weekend on Sunday because I was in Vegas all weekend partying.</p>\n<p>All I've done for my entire career is represent the NBA the right way. Fourteen years, never got in trouble. Respected the game. Print that.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>LeBron's friendships with other players in the league (namely Wade, Paul, Carmelo) were also called into question. He responded:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Go watch the '93 Finals when John Paxson hit the shot. Barkley and Jordan were laughing and joking with each other during one of the games while somebody's shooting a free throw. In the Finals. But, oh, nobody were friends back then.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Finally, he issued a challenge to Chuck.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And if this makes him want to talk to me, the schedule's out there. He knows every road arena I'll be in. Don't just come up to me at All-Star and shake my hand and smile.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/18589897/lebron-james-cleveland-cavaliers-throws-gauntlet-charles-barkley-hater\">Source for all of those quotes</a></p>\n<p>In the latest episode, Charles Barkley ripped LeBron and the Lakers after his highlight dunk was aired on the show. <a href=\"https://streamable.com/2cs9pn\">Clip of that here</a></p>",

You could get into a lot of trouble. For example, a couple of years ago when I played for the Houston Rockets, I tweeted \u201cFree Palestine,\u201d and I almost got kicked out of the league for it. I was just trying to figure out why. Before that, I had spoken with some Palestinians who told me about the struggles in their country. I actually went to the movies one day in Houston, and a group of Palestinians approached me. They said, \u201cHey man, we\u2019re big fans of you. Can we watch the movie with you?\u201d I was like, \u201cCool.\u201d When I was in Houston\u2014or even in Orlando and other cities I played in\u2014I would take fans to movies, to Main Event, or to events at Dave &amp; Buster\u2019s. After the movie, we took pictures, and they asked me to bring awareness to what was going on in their country. Me, having a big heart, thought, \u201cThis is the Christian thing to do.\u201d <strong>So, I tweeted \u201cFree Palestine.\u201d Less than 10 minutes later, I got a call from the NBA commissioner, agents, people in my foundation, and even folks from Texas, telling me to take it down. They said, \u201cYou\u2019re going to get into trouble. You need to delete this tweet.\u201d I was like, \u201cWhat did I do that was so bad? Can somebody explain this to me?\u201d</strong></p>\n</blockquote>",

Fox, Fox Sports, FS1, FS2, FOX Sports EVP Charlie Dixon, Bayless and FS1 host Joy Taylor are listed as defendants in the lawsuit filed on Friday.</p>\n<p>In the suit filed in Los Angeles, Faraji alleges that Dixon, the head of content for FS1, grabbed her buttocks at a birthday party in West Hollywood. When she relayed the encounter to Taylor, the Fox host allegedly told her to \u201cget over it,\u201d according to the suit.</p>\n<p>After starting work on the Undisputed morning show starring Bayless, the suit alleges that he began giving Faraji \u201clingering hugs and kisses on the cheek while putting his body against hers and pressing against her breasts.\u201d The single mother alleges she repeatedly told Bayless she was not interested in him and did not \u201cdate at work\u201d. She also claims she told Bayless she was suffering from ovarian cancer, after developing issues with her left ovary, in an effort to halt his advances.</p>\n<p>As the suit alleges: \u201cApproximately one week later, Mr. Bayless made another advance at Ms. Faraji. Ms. Faraji responded: \u201cSkip, stop, you have a wife.\u201d Mr. Bayless responded: \u201cAren\u2019t you Muslim? Doesn\u2019t your dad have three to four wives?\u201d Ms. Faraji responded that her father was dead, and when Mr. Bayless looked taken aback, she made an excuse to leave.\u201d</p>\n<p>During her time at Fox, Faraji alleges she made multiple complaints to the Human Resources and Employee Relations departments. </p>\n</blockquote>",
