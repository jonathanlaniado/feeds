            "content_html": "<caption>Open: <a href='https://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/16smskp/oconnor_the_celtics_max_offer_for_lillard_cant/'>Reddit</a></caption><div><br></div><div><p>Source: https://streamable.com/pej83f</p>\n<p>Full transcript:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>KOC: I mean the Celtics are the interesting one there because, whether it means anything or not, BetOnline has them as the favorites... The odds makers' favorites to land Dame behind Miami. And I don't think that necessarily matters a whole lot here, but it's at least interesting considering the fact that, you know, Spears reported earlier in the Summer that Tatum was recruiting Dame.</p>\n<p>KOC: I've been saying that Boston should go after him since those rumors started in July. They can put together an interesting offer at the least.</p>\n<p>KOC: The Celtics can trade up to four first round picks, two in '24, one in '26, one in 2030. They have eight second round picks they can deal in the future. It's tough to come up with the money, but they could do it. Brogdon, Robert Williams, Payton Pritchard, Luke Kornet, Sam Hauser, Jordan Walsh. Walsh was just an early second round draft pick that some teams had ranked as a first rounder. So really like five first round picks, plus a young guy in Robert Williams. Maybe you flip him to Phoenix in the Ayton situation. I don't think the offer is better than what the Raptors could do or what some other teams can do, but I do think it's better than what the Heat could do. And that's the interesting thing here. </p>\n<p>VERNON: Well, there's no better player than Herro in that deal.</p>\n<p>KOC: But it's not about how a player is valued in a vacuum. It's about how they're valued to the Portland Trail Blazers. Herro does not have a lot of value to the Blazers. They are invested in Shaedon Sharpe. They have young players in that backcourt. Herro just doesn't make sense for that team. He's redundant. That's why they're so adamant about trying to flip him elsewhere. By the way, if Herro had a lot of value league-wide, he would have been flipped for multiple first-round draft picks. Teams don't see the value in Herro at this point. He's been a Dud in the playoffs other than his bubble series against the Celtics. He has not produced. They went to the finals without him. </p>\n<p>VERNON: Well in fairness, he didn't play. </p>\n<p>KOC: They didn't want him back! Because they were better off without him! He has been a Dud in the playoffs since the bubble his rookie year.</p>\n<p>VERNON: Hold on. Now, did they not want him back or they didn't want him back if they could get Damian Lillard? There's a big difference. </p>\n<p>KOC: No, I'm saying in the Finals... In the Finals, they did not want him back.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I decided to work the trade machine to see how a Phoenix/Portland/Boston trade would work under these parameters and this is what I came with:</p>\n<p>Boston receives:\n* Damian Lillard</p>\n<p>Phoenix receives:\n* Jusuf Nurkic\n* Robert Williams III\n* Payton Pritchard\n* Luke Kornet</p>\n<p>Portland receives:\n* Deandre Ayton\n* Jordan Walsh\n* Sam Hauser\n* Malcolm Brogdon\n* 4 first round picks from BOS\n* 4 second round picks from BOS</p>\n<p>Boston gets another big name to pair with Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown and Kristaps Porzingis while managing to have Al Horford and Derrick White with them. Bench gets kinda rough though.</p>\n<p>Phoenix gets to re-tool their center rotation with 3 capable guys (Nurkic, Williams III, Eubanks) and gets a young backup PG. </p>\n<p>Portland gets a young center, a young 6'7 wing, a veteran they can get mentorship from and flip later, and an insane amount of draft capital.</p>\n<p>[EDIT: I'm not condoning the trade or saying it should get done, just trying to find the logic behind it for each team and seeing what works salary-wise.]</p></div>",

Beginning the following summer, if the Warriors are still into that second level of the tax bracket (where they currently live), they\u2019ll be hit with a handful more punitive penalties, which include the loss of the mini midlevel exception, an inability to add buyout players in-season and frozen draft picks.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s been viewed as a no go for the Warriors internally. They\u2019re remodeling their roster with the intention of ducking the second apron next summer and maintaining flexibility. It was a core reason for the Poole-for-Chris Paul trade. Poole is owed $30.1 million for the 2024-25 season. Paul\u2019s $30 million that season is fully non-guaranteed until June 28, able to be completely shed, if needed.</p>\n<p>That Poole-for-Paul swap should be viewed (among other things) as a clear sign of the Warriors\u2019 commitment to keeping Thompson. He\u2019s owed $43.1 million this upcoming season. An alternate path to duck under the second apron would\u2019ve been to let Thompson\u2019s contract expire and allow him to walk. But they\u2019ve been firm in their intent to eventually extend him, and Thompson has maintained a desire to return.</p>\n</blockquote></div>",

So I expect the whole you know what debate to ensue, but let\u2019s just try to appreciate some of these numbers I\u2019ve observed.</p>\n<p>LeBron will play into the 2024-2025 season. There is no doubt about it. If there is any slither of a chance that LeBron can play with his son Bronny in the NBA, he\u2019ll make it happen. This season is not being treated as a farewell parade, this is just another final chance at a championship with the Lakers.</p>\n<p>So with that made clear, LeBron will <em>almost certainly</em> break the 40,000 total career points mark, and will be on the court as a 40 year old in his 22nd NBA season.</p>\n<p>40,000 points, 40 years of life.</p>\n<p>If LeBron was drafted to the NBA out of the womb (stay with me), he would have averaged 1000 points per year for every year of his life. Over 82 games in a season, that\u2019s 12.2 points per game.</p>\n<p>It would take a newborn baby 40 years at 12.2 ppg to touch his record. How many NBA players have averaged over 12 points in their career? How many averaged over 12 points in a single season?</p>\n<p>I can\u2019t give you the exact number unfortunately, consider the average points per game for the average NBA player is around 9, 1 career year of LeBron\u2019s life would be worth <em>more</em> than at least 50% of the entire history of the NBA\u2019s player bases career. But I can put it into another perspective</p>\n<p>If you split LeBron\u2019s life into two 21 year stints in the NBA at 12.2 ppg, 82 games, he would have 2 careers with 21,000 total points.</p>\n<p>There have been 50 players in the history of the NBA to reach 20,000 total points over their career.</p>\n<p>LeBron reaches the top 50 all time points in 2 seperate lives.</p>\n<p>And while we play fantasy with these obviously absurd reaches, we need to remember that LeBron didn\u2019t play 82 games a year, nor did he / has he played for 40 years in the NBA</p>\n<p>He will play 22 seasons. Averaging no less than the 20.9 ppg in his rookie season. The fastest to reach every single 1000 point milestone for his time.</p>\n<p>Oh, and he\u2019ll do this all while also finishing with well over 10,000 rebounds AND assists. That\u2019s a 40 point triple double\u2026 x1000.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s appreciate greatness while we still can.</p></div>",
