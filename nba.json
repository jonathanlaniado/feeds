Lillard said he was in the eighth grade when LeBron made his NBA debut and to this day marvels at how James exceeded the expectations placed upon his career while under unprecedented scrutiny.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was watching him on ESPN back then, so to have that type of hype and to live up to it and then some,\u201d Lillard said, \u201cto come out as your all-time leading scorer in this league, to win how he\u2019s won, to be as scrutinized as he is and has been. \u2026 I can just respect how he (has handled the pressure).\u201d</p>\n<p>Antetokounmpo\u2019s first season was James\u2019 last in Miami.

Then James left for Los Angeles, where he became the first player in NBA history to be the best player on title teams in three cities.</p>\n<p>Giannis now has two MVPs and one championship to his name. He said James has provided the \u201cblueprint\u201d for any star seeking longevity atop the sport.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor 21 years, you never get in trouble, to be able to take in his family, protect this family, raise his kids the right way, you know, be happily married, all those things, it\u2019s perfect,\u201d Antetokounmpo said. \u201cHe\u2019s kind of like setting the blueprint for the rest of us to go forward. That\u2019s what I want. I want to be able to do what I do on the court consistently, be good, be healthy, be available for my team, be able to, you know, raise my family in a bubble away from what I do on the court for them to have a normal life as much as I can. Stay out of trouble.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd hopefully one day, you know, when I\u2019m done from the game of basketball \u2026 maybe you mention me? I don\u2019t know.

He will run Mosaic, a $200 million venture capital fund that he just raised with his longtime business partner, Rudy Cline-Thomas.</p>\n<p>Iguodala\u2019s disclosure ends years of speculation. The 39-year-old had suggested that last year\u2019s season would be his last, only to shoot down rumors about it earlier this year. But now is the time to hang up his sneakers. \u201cIt\u2019s been a blessing to play for that long,\u201d he told DealBook. (He hasn\u2019t fully come to grips with it yet: \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s actually hit me yet,\u201d he said.)</p>\n<p>He\u2019s embracing his next act. Though he and Cline-Thomas had begun buying tech stocks in 2010, the two dived deeply into start-ups when he joined the Warriors in 2013. \u201cWhen I initially went out to the Bay Area, it was my intent to have success on and off the court,\u201d Iguodala said. \u201cI thought about how to get access.\u201d</p>\n<p>That led to meetings with venture capital firms like Andreessen Horowitz, and then to taking stakes in start-ups, including Zoom and the cybersecurity provider Cloudflare.</p>\n<p>It is a model now followed by many pro athletes, from the N.F.L.\u2019s Patrick Mahomes and Aaron Rodgers to Iguodala\u2019s longtime Warriors teammate Steph Curry. \u201cAthletes are becoming smarter and smarter,\u201d Iguodala said, asserting that their competitiveness and an ability to speak to audiences help to sell and scale products.</p>\n<p>Mosaic is now his focus. The firm will home in on seed- and early-stage investments in enterprise software, fintech health care and sports companies. Iguodala and Cline-Thomas closed Mosaic\u2019s first fund \u2014 whose investors included endowments, institutions and founders of companies they have already backed \u2014 in May.</p>\n<p>Mosaic\u2019s investments include Vessel, a builder of modular multifamily homes, and Athletes First, an N.F.L. talent agency and management firm.</p>\n<p>Sports franchise ownership is another focus. Iguodala is a co-owner of Leeds United, an English soccer club; Bay Area F.C., the National Women\u2019s Soccer League team; and, along with former teammates Curry and Klay Thompson, the San Francisco branch of TGL, the upstart golf league co-founded by Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy.</p>\n<p>Iguodala\u2019s highest aspiration? Owning an N.B.A. team. \u201cThe timing has to be right,\u201d he said, but \u201cthat\u2019s definitely the ultimate goal.\u201d</p>\n<p>https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/20/business/dealbook/middle-east-israel-economy.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare</p>",

We just don't want to see what makes it personal.</p>\n<p>I've debated writing anything. But, being vulnerable helps me heal. This isn't new. We've been traded before. Each time we've felt something different but this time it crushed me.</p>\n<p>Our daughter started 1st grade a month ago. Our son started preschool. Our kids go to school with other Bucks children. Their dads walk them in and walk out together. The other women on the Bucks have been my workout partners, my confidants, and my support system. We have had Bible studies, and retreats and shared so many laughs and tears. Not to mention the relationships we have built through our church, our community, and our JLH grantees. All of this is personal to us. It's our life. There's no business to any of that.</p>\n<p>Milwaukee was home.</p>\n<p>\"On Wednesday, my husband took a nap. He woke up to news that he had been moved. No warning, no heads up, not even a conversation that it could be a possibility. Just, it's done. Now move on because 'it's not personal, it's business'. </p>\n<p>I'm not sharing this to say we are entitled to anything. I'm sharing this to say we are human beings whose kids develop friendships with other kids in our community, we are people who value family and friendships and invest in the cities we play in. We don't just take from the city we play in, we give to the city we play in and we give our all.</p>\n<p>So, yes, this is more than business. Not because we're offended by it but, because we are people, we're humans, we have relationships, dreams, and a connection to where we play.</p>\n<p>As I write this, we are grieving the loss of that while celebrating the hope and the joy of what's ahead. The growth is in allowing ourselves to feel this pain now and turn it into power for how we move forward. That's who we are and that's who we always will be</p>\n<p>Imagine a world where we didn't hide behind the business of things, where we didin't treat one another like commodities, instead we saw each other as valuable pieces of a human community meant to serve one another in a mosaic of ways.</p>\n<p>Imagine if we didn't just put dollar signs on athletes. Imagine if we invested in them as humans, as incredible forces for good, if we had the same expectations for ourselves i our everyday lives that we have for every athlete that steps into their sarena. We expect effort. We expect focus. We expect integrity. We expect greatness. What if our standard for business was the same? In other words, imagine if it was personal AND business. That's the world I want to create.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I'll always cherish this place. This is my home. I'll always live here regardless.\"</p>\n<p>The Heat say they never had a legitimate opportunity to negotiate. Throughout the process, they felt Portland allowed emotions to get in the way of business. Lillard's camp believed it had become personal.</p>\n<p>Frustrated with the lack of suitable offers, sources say the Trail Blazers ceased all communication with Lillard and Goodwin in early September. Portland's rationale for keeping them in the dark was to prevent Goodwin from sabotaging potential deals behind the scenes.</p>\n<p>Lillard then said if a deal couldn't be worked out with the Heat, he would prefer to rescind his trade request and return to the Trail Blazers.</p>\n<p>Cronin's response to the seven-time All-Star was that there was no coming back.</p>\n<p>At the end of the session, Cronin promised to do a better job communicating. In the days ahead, Cronin and Goodwin started communicating again.</p>\n<p>\"My whole life I've been on underdog teams and if we had a good season, we overachieved. Now I'll be able to play with a player that's better than me and to be a part of a great overall team is a dream come true,\" Lillard told B/R. \"That's never been my experience. It's time for me to be in this situation. And knowing myself enough, I'm going to take advantage of it. I'm excited for this opportunity.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1>Giannis Antetokounmpo:</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For Milwaukee, it's all about giving Giannis Antetokounmpo the best possible shot at another championship. Antetokounmpo spoke to B/R about losing Holiday and acquiring a new star teammate in Lillard.\n\"Jrue is my f--king brother for life. I love his family. I love him. I appreciate him. I wish him nothing but the best. He blessed me with a f--king championship,\" Antetokounmpo told B/R. \"He's the one who made that huge steal in Game 5 of the Finals. I went to battle with him multiple times. F--k basketball. F--k the media shit. This guy is my brother for life, and it's always going to be like that. He's going to thrive wherever he ends up.</p>\n<p>\"Now at the same time, I'm excited to have Dame. He gives us a chance to win a championship. I'm excited to play with the caliber of player that he is. He can score the ball in his sleep and shoot the lights out.</p>\n<p>\"It's a bittersweet day for the city of Milwaukee. You get Dame, who is a great player, but you lose a great guy. Jrue took us to the promised land. I'm 10 years in now. I know it's a business. At the end of the day, Jrue will alway be be my brother for life. He's one of the best human beings I've been around. But we've got to focus on the goal to win the championship. Dame wants this. He's hungry to win, and he's going to push us. I'm very happy to have him on our team.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1>Ending:</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When the deal was announced, one of the first text messages Lillard received was from Antetokounmpo.\nIt read, \"Let's get this f--king championship.\" That's all Lillard ever wanted.</p>\n</blockquote></div>",

            "content_html": "<caption>Open: <a href='https://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/16smskp/oconnor_the_celtics_max_offer_for_lillard_cant/'>Reddit</a></caption><div><br></div><div><p>Source: https://streamable.com/pej83f</p>\n<p>Full transcript:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>KOC: I mean the Celtics are the interesting one there because, whether it means anything or not, BetOnline has them as the favorites... The odds makers' favorites to land Dame behind Miami. And I don't think that necessarily matters a whole lot here, but it's at least interesting considering the fact that, you know, Spears reported earlier in the Summer that Tatum was recruiting Dame.</p>\n<p>KOC: I've been saying that Boston should go after him since those rumors started in July. They can put together an interesting offer at the least.</p>\n<p>KOC: The Celtics can trade up to four first round picks, two in '24, one in '26, one in 2030. They have eight second round picks they can deal in the future. It's tough to come up with the money, but they could do it. Brogdon, Robert Williams, Payton Pritchard, Luke Kornet, Sam Hauser, Jordan Walsh. Walsh was just an early second round draft pick that some teams had ranked as a first rounder. So really like five first round picks, plus a young guy in Robert Williams. Maybe you flip him to Phoenix in the Ayton situation. I don't think the offer is better than what the Raptors could do or what some other teams can do, but I do think it's better than what the Heat could do. And that's the interesting thing here. </p>\n<p>VERNON: Well, there's no better player than Herro in that deal.</p>\n<p>KOC: But it's not about how a player is valued in a vacuum. It's about how they're valued to the Portland Trail Blazers. Herro does not have a lot of value to the Blazers. They are invested in Shaedon Sharpe. They have young players in that backcourt. Herro just doesn't make sense for that team. He's redundant. That's why they're so adamant about trying to flip him elsewhere. By the way, if Herro had a lot of value league-wide, he would have been flipped for multiple first-round draft picks. Teams don't see the value in Herro at this point. He's been a Dud in the playoffs other than his bubble series against the Celtics. He has not produced. They went to the finals without him. </p>\n<p>VERNON: Well in fairness, he didn't play. </p>\n<p>KOC: They didn't want him back! Because they were better off without him! He has been a Dud in the playoffs since the bubble his rookie year.</p>\n<p>VERNON: Hold on. Now, did they not want him back or they didn't want him back if they could get Damian Lillard? There's a big difference. </p>\n<p>KOC: No, I'm saying in the Finals... In the Finals, they did not want him back.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I decided to work the trade machine to see how a Phoenix/Portland/Boston trade would work under these parameters and this is what I came with:</p>\n<p>Boston receives:\n* Damian Lillard</p>\n<p>Phoenix receives:\n* Jusuf Nurkic\n* Robert Williams III\n* Payton Pritchard\n* Luke Kornet</p>\n<p>Portland receives:\n* Deandre Ayton\n* Jordan Walsh\n* Sam Hauser\n* Malcolm Brogdon\n* 4 first round picks from BOS\n* 4 second round picks from BOS</p>\n<p>Boston gets another big name to pair with Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown and Kristaps Porzingis while managing to have Al Horford and Derrick White with them. Bench gets kinda rough though.</p>\n<p>Phoenix gets to re-tool their center rotation with 3 capable guys (Nurkic, Williams III, Eubanks) and gets a young backup PG. </p>\n<p>Portland gets a young center, a young 6'7 wing, a veteran they can get mentorship from and flip later, and an insane amount of draft capital.</p>\n<p>[EDIT: I'm not condoning the trade or saying it should get done, just trying to find the logic behind it for each team and seeing what works salary-wise.]</p></div>",
