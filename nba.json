            "content_html": "<p>Source: https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/45900688/how-lakers-build-luka-fits-options-lebron-future</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u2018I think he will get $30 [million] plus,\u2019 one executive told ESPN, echoing multiple front office sources who were asked about the next deal Reaves could command. The expectation, from both that executive and others, is that Reaves ultimately will return to Los Angeles, which would cement Reaves' role as the long-term running mate next to Doncic in L.A.'s backcourt -- the role once held by Brunson then Irving in Dallas.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t think Reaves is ever going to be the level of player Irving or Brunson were/are. Just for context, James Harden makes $36M per year and was just All-NBA and helped lead the Clippers to 50 wins with Kawhi Leonard only playing in 37 games (half of those while he was on a minutes restriction). Could Reaves have done that? I\u2019m not so sure.</p>\n<p>Outside of his first playoff series in the 2022-23 season, Reaves has seen a significant drop statistically from his regular season averages. In the playoffs for the 2023-24 season and the 2024-25 season he was a cumulative -46 in his minutes on the court. </p>",

            "content_html": "<p>In late 1999, when he was 21, Bryant met the girl who would put an end to his bachelor days. Vanessa Laine, 16, aspiring model and high-school sophomore, was working as a background dancer in a Snoop Dogg video that was shooting at the same studio where Bryant was trying to film his own rap video. (For a brief moment, Bryant wanted a future as a rap star.) The two clicked immediately. \"He was into her,\" recalls Snoop.</p>\n<p>Soon, Bryant was picking up Laine at school in his black Mercedes and dropping her off in the mornings. (The teenager was living with her stepgrandfather at the time and had lots of freedom.) When TV news crews got wind of the romance, they regularly began flying helicopters over the Marina High campus in Huntington Beach, Calif., to get shots of the couple. The courtship caused such a stir that school authorities banned Bryant from coming near campus or attending any school events with her. Marina High officials declined to discuss the matter. \"It just set this bad example for the school and the kids, but Kobe didn't understand what the message was when he dropped her off early in the morning,\" says his friend Tonahill. Bryant's eventual answer to the problem was to pay for Vanessa to be home-schooled.</p>\n<p>As disapproving as school officials were, it was nothing compared with the disappointment of Bryant's family, who watched as Kobe became \"unnaturally attached\" to Vanessa, as one family friend put it. With her long, fire-engine-red fingernails and black lipliner, Vanessa had little in common with the successful young women Kobe had romanced in the past. The family thought she was too young and uncultured, and the fact that she wasn't black--Laine's mother is Hispanic and her father is white--didn't help. His teammates didn't know what to make of Vanessa, either. \"We all knew he got so attached to her because he needed a friend, someone to hang out with,\" says a fellow Laker. \"I'm not sure if it was love, or he was just happy that someone accepted him with no complaints. He didn't understand that she was a kid and she was in awe of him.\" When Tonahill asked Kobe what he saw in the 16-year-old, he responded, \"She's pure, and innocent, and not jaded by the world.\"</p>\n<p>Even though his family hoped the relationship was a passing fancy, in public they tried to be supportive, appearing at games with Vanessa and her mother and stepfather, and coming together at the end of the 2000 season to celebrate what would be the first of three consecutive championships for Bryant and the Lakers.</p>\n<p>But it didn't last. when Kobe proposed to Vanessa with a seven-carat diamond engagement ring and announced that she would be moving into the Pacific Palisades mansion, the family exploded, a person close to the situation said. They pointed out to him that Vanessa and her mother were spending a great deal of Kobe's money on Rodeo Drive, and that the Laine family was in tough financial straits. They pleaded with Kobe to take it slow, or at the very least to get a solid prenuptial agreement. It was a dicey subject to broach, given that Kobe's father, sisters and brother-in-law were all working for him in various capacities. Angered and insulted, Bryant withdrew.</p>\n<p>\"He was so torn by that situation, so upset about the directions he was being pulled,\" said Tonahill. It wasn't just his family who disapproved of the marriage. Laker coach Phil Jackson encouraged him to hold off for a few years. Reportedly, Michael Jordan and a couple of other athletes also made calls to Bryant suggesting that he take it slow, or at least get a prenup. \"He just said, 'I can make the money back',\" says a player who tried to advise him. \"He was like, 'She can have it, because I'm young and I don't see it ending like that way anyway'.\" His agent, Tellum, was so frustrated by Bryant's refusal to get a prenuptial agreement that he stopped representing him. In April 2001, Bryant married Laine in a small Catholic church in Dana Point. None of his family or teammates was there.</p>\n<p>Source: https://www.newsweek.com/kobe-court-138547</p>",

The loss was the nadir of Don\u010di\u0107\u2019s worst NBA season. For all the criticism of Don\u010di\u0107\u2019s body, until this past season, nobody could diss his body of work: He\u2019d never played fewer than 60 games in a season, and just a year earlier, he\u2019d powered the Mavs to the NBA Finals. No such luck in 2024. A calf injury knocked him out for all of January. Then Dallas sent him packing. Then came the 4-1 playoff series decimation at the hands of the Timberwolves. One day after that loss, Don\u010di\u0107 texted Seager to start his offseason training program ASAP. \u201cSo every summer I try my best to work on different things,\" he says. \"Obviously, I'm very competitive. This summer was just a little bit different, you know. It kind of motivated me to be even better.\u201d</p>\n<p>The early postseason exit gave Don\u010di\u0107 more than motivation. It granted him a full four months of rest. That\u2019s allowed him to work in lockstep with what he calls Team Luka, a trio of wellness specialists\u2014Barrio, Ma\u010dek, and nutritionist Lucia Almendros\u2014who he hired back in 2023, after the Mavs had missed the playoffs. Back then, he was a 24-year-old hunting for ways to take his game to the next level.</p>",

The NBA superstar has taken plenty of heat for his conditioning and physique over the years, but after a full summer of training and lots of protein, he\u2019s poised to take his game\u2014and the Lakers\u2014to another level.",
            "content_html": "<p>LUKA DON\u010dI\u0107 KNOWS that you\u2019re thinking he looks lean as heck now. That\u2019s because he\u2019s thinking the exact same thing.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s an early morning in July in a quiet town in Croatia, and the five-time NBA All-Star is alone on a private basketball court, working out with trainer An\u017ee Ma\u010dek, midway through a 90-minute session that blends weight training, agility work, and shooting drills. This is the first of the day\u2019s two workouts for the Los Angeles Lakers star in what may be the most pivotal season of his career, and he\u2019s doing it fasted, just as he\u2019s done for much of the summer. At the moment, he\u2019s driving to the basket, a thick resistance band strapped to his waist, pulling against him during every shot.</p>\n<p>The workout consists of a series of circuits, each set up to include an on-court challenge (like those resistance band lay-ups) and an upper-body and lower-body exercise. The facility, which is located in the town where Don\u010di\u0107 has vacationed every summer since he was a teen, didn\u2019t have weights until earlier this month when he had dumbbells, barbells, weight plates, and med balls trucked in. Now, Don\u010di\u0107 can do everything from trap-bar deadlifts to landmine overhead presses\u2014and he works through sprints and jumps on an outdoor track too.</p>\n<p>He moves swiftly from circuit to circuit, banging out hip stretches one moment, working through renegade rows the next. It\u2019s a session with barely any breathers, which is fine. This version of Don\u010di\u0107 doesn\u2019t need them. This Luka is\u2026different.</p>\n<p>You see it in the way his Jordan Brand jersey hangs loose, and in the new hints of definition on his arms. You see it in the complete absence of fatigue he shows when going from heavy Romanian deadlifts to dumbbell bench presses to lateral bounds\u2014one right after the other. And you see it in the way he smiles when he admits that he\u2019s noticed his sleek silhouette in the mirror. He subtly nods to his reshaped delts during our Zoom interview. And as he splays out his long-limbed physique on the bleachers in the gym, he seems relaxed, calmly making eye contact. His arms look longer today than usual, perhaps because he\u2019s just so downright skinny, a fact which now (finally!) he sheepishly acknowledges. \u201cJust visually, I would say my whole body looks better,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>And yes, somehow, in the world of sports, the way you look matters\u2014even though it shouldn\u2019t. From Nikola Joki\u0107 to Patrick Mahomes to Shaq, decades before all of them, we\u2019ve seen loads of evidence that athletic dominance comes in all shapes and sizes. But ask anyone to pick out an athlete in a crowd, and they\u2019ll almost always point to the dude with LeBron-size arms and Ronaldo-level abs.</p>\n<p>Don\u010di\u0107, still just 26 years old, is unquestionably a topflight athlete (more on that soon). But he\u2019s never quite looked the Greek god part. And somehow, that shortcoming too often has undercut his five All-NBA first team nods and his 82 career triple-doubles (already seventh all-time). Last August, critics blasted him for looking \u201cfat\u201d and \u201cout of shape\u201d during a charity game. The moment the Mavs traded him to the Lakers in February, rumors leaked that Dallas didn\u2019t want to deal with his love of beer and hookah. Even this summer, the NBA web has chattered that Don\u010di\u0107 is on Ozempic.</p>\n<p>What the Luka haters have never seen is this: Don\u010di\u0107 slogging through two-a-days in Croatia while sticking to a gluten-free, low-sugar diet that includes at least 250 grams of protein and one almond milk\u2013fueled shake a day. They never knew that Don\u010di\u0107 had quietly constructed a fitness team several years ago to help enhance his (very dangerous) natural gifts. And they never realized how much he committed to training and diet this summer.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s the thing too: Even if you thought Luka Don\u010di\u0107 had a dadbod, he was already a top-five NBA player.

He didn't look for the LA Lakers. They looked for him. What has been happening in recent months could be the beginnings of a long-term partnership with the exposed image of Luka Don\u010di\u0107 in a new big chapter of one of the most recognizable sports franchises in the world.</p>\n<p>Although last season taught us that there is no sealed future in the NBA, even if the back of your jersey says \"Don\u010di\u0107\", it still seems that Luka and the LA Lakers will announce a long-term journey together in just over a week. The Ljubljana native is already waiting for a new multi-year contract in California. He is expected to sign it on August 2nd.</p>\n<p>In this light, it becomes crystal clear and reasonable to explain that the first star of the Slovenian national team will join the preparations for EuroBasket 2025 with a delay. Basically, NBA basketball players can prepare with the national team for 28 days. Luka will shorten this period slightly. \"I expect him to arrive after August 4, when he has completed all his obligations in the USA,\" said coach Aleksander Sekuli\u0107 yesterday.</p>\n<p>The American media speculated that Luka, who has been sculpting his body in recent weeks, losing several kilograms and reducing his body fat percentage, might be delaying signing a new contract since September. There were even hints that he might wait until next summer, when he would be a completely free player and available to all clubs. But it seems that the uncertainty will soon be over. Don\u010di\u0107 is said to have agreed to a four-year extension worth 229 million US dollars.</p>",

It\u2019s important to treat those players with respect.\u201d</strong></p>\n<p>Nelson didn\u2019t directly criticize the front office but clarified that Don\u010di\u0107\u2019s exit didn\u2019t reflect the values that had defined the Mavericks during his tenure.</p>\n<p><strong>\u201cThat\u2019s why there was so much disappointment after what happened to Luka,\u201d he said. \u201cNot just my disappointment, but a universal disappointment. Could this happen to Real [Madrid]? Never. And it wouldn\u2019t have happened when I was in Dallas.\u201d</strong></p>\n<p>Nelson served as the Mavericks\u2019 general manager and president of basketball operations during Nowitzki\u2019s entire career and was the driving force behind the trade that brought Don\u010di\u0107 to Dallas in 2018. He parted ways with the organization in 2021 but has publicly supported both players.</p>\n<p>Don\u010di\u0107 is now focused on the Lakers for the next chapter of his career.

When the Pelicans traded the lightly protected 2026 pick from the Pacers for the rights to pick 23 in this draft, rival executives raised their eyebrows. What was the rush to conduct this move while the Pacers were still in the finals? Just hours after Shams broke the trade, the Pacers announced Haliburton has been diagnosed with a calf strain. The optics pointed to a team that had been duped.</p>\n<p>Haliburton would go on to tear his Achilles tendon just a few days later, lending credibility to criticisms being levied by rival teams regarding the Pelicans\u2019 decision making. The trade should have been executed after the finals. There was no reason the same deal would not have been on the table. The miscalculation was not a grave one, but it was one big enough to reinforce the priors for other teams\u2014 the Pelicans are a mark and do not understand risk.</p>\n<p>Sure enough, the league\u2019s collective belief on the Pelicans\u2019 lack of risk assessment would be proven true. The Pelicans would trade the unprotected 2026 draft pick which was the better of their own and Milwaukee to move up 10 spots in the draft\u2014 to draft a player Troy Weaver was fixated on in Derik Queen. In totality, the Pelicans traded away three shots at top 10 pick for the 13th overall pick. All three shots featured a team with a starting point guard who had suffered a torn Achilles.</p>\n<p>One league executive would tell me their internal models valued the traded pick as having the second highest probability for becoming number one overall next season. Suffice to say\u2014 the league was stunned, and so was Atlanta.</p>\n<p>The Hawks could not believe their good fortune. While the Pelicans would spend the next 24 hours facing enormous backlash for their reckless decision making, Hawks executives weren\u2019t shy about sharing the details behind deal\u2019s lopsided structure with rival teams.</p>\n<p>One Eastern executive with knowledge of how the conversation went from Atlanta\u2019s perspective described a perplexing scene. When Senior Vice President Troy Weaver made the call to Atlanta\u2019s Bryson Graham, Graham couldn\u2019t believe what was actually being offered. Graham asked for clarification multiple times to confirm the unprotected pick was indeed part of the deal. It got to the point where Hawks General Manager, Onsi Saleh, called Joe Dumars directly to confirm for himself. The Hawks waited nervously for Dumars to confirm, hoping he would not realize what was going on and walk the trade back. But the Pelicans persisted and the Hawks got their steal.</p>",

And if the Lakers didn't use all of the midlevel exception, they could take on more salary in a trade and absorb the extra money into whatever they have left of the MLE.</strong></p>",

Zhou Qi thought for a moment and said:</p>\n<p>\"If I were to give any advice, I think the most important thing is to maintain a balanced mindset. The U.S. and Australia are quite different. In the U.S., there are a lot of Black players. Their playing style, physicality, and ways of expressing themselves are all very different from ours. Once you get to the NBA, to be honest, they don't really respect us deep down. They may not say it outright, but they'll express it in other ways.\"</p>\n<p>Hearing this, Yang Yi immediately said, \u201cSo he\u2019s definitely going to get bullied!\u201d</p>\n<p>Zhou Qi nodded and continued,<br />\n\"Exactly. That\u2019s why mindset is especially important at that point. How you perceive your own role or position will shape your mentality over there.\"</p>\n<p>Zhou Qi then added,<br />\n\"Later on, I spent some time in Australia, and it was only after coming back to China that I truly felt the difference. There aren\u2019t many Black players in Australia, and I also played there for a while.\"</p>\n<p>--</p>",

Certainly, Smith and his tag team partner Skip Bayless contributed the rings-above-all mindset to the NBA and trashed multiple generations of stars along the way. Certainly, they have disparaged and demeaned, ranted and raged, all under the guise of \u2018debate.\u2019 What else?</p>\n<p>He takes far more from the NBA than he has ever given; the only time he gives as good as he gets is when he is exchanging barbs with the league\u2019s biggest stars. That includes just this week during the NBA Finals, when he made a point of diminishing Pacers G Tyrese Haliburton over a perceived slight. He went further earlier in the year, threatening to air dirty laundry of LeBron James and then making references to disputed claims about James\u2019 attendance at Kobe Bryant\u2019s 2020 memorial service \u2014 an insinuation for which he later apologized.</p>\n<p>Smith\u2019s threats are a particularly bizarre character trait. Whether Kevin Durant years ago or James earlier this season, Smith appears to believe he has something on these players \u2014 that his bully pulpit is one he can weaponize to not just criticize players when warranted, but to shame them; to harm their public standing, perceptions of their ability, and their careers.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Don\u2019t know how to explain it other than shock. Words cannot express the pain of this letdown. The frustration is unfathomable. I\u2019ve worked my whole life to get to this moment and this is how it ends? Makes no sense.</p>\n<p>Now that I\u2019ve gotten surgery, I wish I could count the number of times people will tell me I\u2019m going to \u201ccome back stronger\u201d. What a cliche lol, this shit sucks. My foot feels like dead weight fam. But what\u2019s hurting most I think is my mind. Feel like I\u2019m rambling, but I know this is something I\u2019ll look back on when I\u2019m through this, as something I\u2019m proud I fought through. It feels good to let this shit out without y\u2019all seeing the kid ugly cry.</p>\n<p>At 25, I\u2019ve already learned that God never gives us more than we can handle. I know I\u2019ll come out on the other side of this a better man and a better player. And honestly, right now, torn Achilles and all, I don\u2019t regret it. I\u2019d do it again, and again after that, to fight for this city and my brothers. For the chance to do something special.</p>\n<p>Indy, I\u2019m sorry. If any fan base doesn\u2019t deserve this, it\u2019s y\u2019all. But together we are going to fight like hell to get back to this very spot, and get over this hurdle. I don\u2019t doubt for a second that y\u2019all have my back, and I hope you guys know that I have yours. I think Kobe said it best when in this same situation. \u201cThere are far greater issues/challenges in the world then a torn achilles. Stop feeling sorry for yourself, find the silver lining and get to work with the same belief, same drive and same conviction as ever.\u201d And that\u2019s exactly right. I will do everything in my power to get back right.</p>\n<p>My journey to get to where I am today wasn\u2019t by happenstance, I\u2019ve pushed myself every day to be great. And I will continue to do just that. The most important part of this all, is that I\u2019m grateful. I\u2019m grateful for every single experience that\u2019s led me here. I\u2019m grateful for all the love from the hoop world. I don\u2019t \u201chave to\u201d go through this, I get to go through this. I\u2019m grateful for the road that lies ahead. Watch how I come back from this. So, give me some time, I\u2019ll dust myself off and get right back to being the best version of Tyrese Haliburton.</p>\n<p>- 0<br />\nProverbs 3:5-6 \u201cTrust in the Lord with all your heart, and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will make your paths straight.\"</p>\n</blockquote>",
