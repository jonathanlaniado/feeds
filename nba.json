According to multiple league sources, Irving has yet to receive a vaccine shot. Both the Nets and a spokeswoman for Irving declined to comment on the record about Irving\u2019s vaccination status, but Nets general manager Sean Marks was asked during a news conference on Tuesday whether New York City\u2019s mandate could sideline any of his team\u2019s players.</p>\n<p>\"Regarding if they could play today, I can't comment on who could play and so forth. There would obviously be a couple people missing from that picture,\" Marks said. \"I won't get into who it is, but we feel confident in the following several days before camp everybody would be allowed to participate and so forth.\"</p>\n<p>Earlier in the news conference, Marks said: \"I think we all understand what\u2019s at stake. We\u2019ve had very candid conversations. \u2026 We don\u2019t see whether it\u2019s a citywide mandate, or it\u2019s the league mandate to follow, being any sort of hindrance to us being able to put out a team.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<blockquote>\n<p>The league's memos, which also state that a player who misses games \"as a result of his inability to comply with local law might subject him to a reduction of his compensation by the NBA or his team,\" have changed some minds, according to league sources. </p>\n<p>But multiple agents have said in interviews that they\u2019re having trouble convincing their remaining holdouts. </p>\n<p>\"We work for the players,\" one said. \"And they all have different reasons.

Now, as the start of the 2021-22 season nears, the organization is dealing with an ongoing headache behind the scenes because Wiggins' stance has not changed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Wiggins has, to this point, decided against getting the vaccine, a league source told ESPN, confirming a San Francisco Chronicle report Wednesday night. This has put into question his availability for some games for the start of the season. As of Aug. 20, the city of San Francisco has required proof of vaccination for large indoor events.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Warriors declined to comment on Wiggins' situation late Wednesday night, citing player privacy protocols. In a statement to the Chronicle, the San Francisco Department of Public Health said it would not comment specifically on Wiggins' situation -- unless the NBA grants him a religious exemption.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"To each his own, really. Whoever wants to get it, can get it; whoever doesn't want to get it, don't get it,\" Wiggins said on March 22. \"Right now, I'm not getting it, but it's no knock on anyone else that's getting it. I make my own decisions. But right now, I decided not to get it.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Wiggins at the time said he was waiting for more information.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Yeah, I don't really see myself getting it any time soon, unless I'm forced to somehow,\" Wiggins said in March. \"Other than that, I'm good.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Chronicle reported that the Warriors put Wiggins in touch with an Oakland doctor to discuss the hesitancy in getting the vaccine, but he did not change his stance.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Full Article: <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/32261240/warriors-andrew-wiggins-remains-unvaccinated-source-says-jeopardizing-availability-golden-state\">https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/32261240/warriors-andrew-wiggins-remains-unvaccinated-source-says-jeopardizing-availability-golden-state</a></p></div>",

Had the Warriors beaten the Lakers they would have been guaranteed at least three more home playoff games in May.</p>\n<p><strong>\u201cLeBron hitting a three shouldn\u2019t cost people their health coverage,\u201d</strong> said Anand Singh, president of UNITE HERE local 2, the union that represents 930 concession workers at Chase Center and Oracle Park, where the Giants play. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely ridiculous to take away workers\u2019 health care in a pandemic over something that\u2019s no fault of their own. That\u2019s one of the reasons we have chosen to fight.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Like most professional sports teams in the United States, both the Warriors and the Giants use a subcontractor to handle food preparation and sales at their home games. In this case, concession workers at Warriors and Giants games work for a company called Bon Appetite.</p>\n<p>Last Saturday, 96.7% of concession workers at Oracle Park voted to strike for a number of reasons. Workers I spoke to cited the fact that they\u2019re scared of losing health care over scheduling issues, frustrated they haven\u2019t been given hazard pay during the Covid-19 pandemic, and upset that the Giants are allowing fans to order food from them without wearing masks. \u201cThere is signage up but there is no enforcement,\u201d Singh said. (I attended last Saturday and Sunday\u2019s games and found this to be accurate).</p>\n<p>In a statement to The Long Game, a team official said, \u201cThe Giants make the health and safety of everyone working and visiting Oracle Park a top priority.  We operate our venue in compliance with local and state health requirements.\u201d (The Warriors had not yet returned a request for comment at press time).</p>\n<p>While they continue to work during a pandemic, concession workers are asking for an additional three dollars an hour in hazard pay. They haven\u2019t yet gone on strike, but on Friday the union announced it would begin holding sign-ups for picketing outside Oracle Park.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Julie Nordman has been working concessions at Giants games for thirty years and voted to strike. She told me that the 2020 season without fans was a nightmare, during which she had no income and no medical insurance. \u201cI got Covid and spent three and a half weeks in bed,\u201d said Nordman. \u201cMy husband and I were sick on our 36th wedding anniversary.\u201d</p>\n<p>Nordman manages thirteen employees at the Doggie Diner hot dog stand behind home plate and says she loves working Giants games. \u201cI raised all three of my daughters on baseball,\u201d said Nordman. \u201cThe atmosphere with all our co-workers and season tickets holders is like a family. I just love it.\u201d Nordman said a season ticket holder in her section, a teacher, heard about their vote to strike and wanted to write a check to cover the additional three dollars an hour for every employee working that night. \u201cThese are the kind of people we serve every day.\u201d said Nordman. \u201cThis is why so many of us stay in these jobs for thirty, forty years.\u201d</p>\n<p>But May was also a bad month for Giants concession workers. The team only had nine home games on their schedule, so all the concession workers lost health care for the month of July. \u201cUsually they\u2019ll come up with another event like a graduation or a high school game to get us to ten so we can keep our coverage,\u201d said Nordman. \u201cBut because of Covid that didn\u2019t happen. So we had a lot of people who couldn\u2019t afford their medications in July so they just went without. It\u2019s really tough.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The day the Giants schedule comes out is also a scary day for Rhonda Mitchell, who has been working concessions at Giants games for twenty-one years. (She currently manages the McGraw Derby Grille on the top deck.) Mitchell, a native San Franciscan, says she\u2019s been a Giants fan since she was six years old. She remembers watching her all-time favorite Willie Mays make spectacular catches at Candlestick Park like it was yesterday. With no games last season to work, Mitchell was forced to rely on unemployment and savings to scrape by and pay her monthly bills.</p>\n<p>I visited Mitchell\u2019s stand and, because of the chicken fingers and garlic fries, it was one of the busier areas in the park. In the fifth inning of Sunday\u2019s game the line stretched for 30 minutes. \u201cI love the fans but they should know how hard we work,\u201d said Mitchell. \u201cIt may seem easy to get all that food to hundreds of people but it\u2019s not.\u201d Concession workers arrive four hours before first pitch and stay until about an hour after last pitch.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Singh says the union has been negotiating for several months on a new contract that includes the pay raise and new health and safety protocols. \u201cThese people live on a razor\u2019s edge,\u201d said Singh. \u201cThey can\u2019t afford to catch Covid and get sick and lose their health care.\u201d Singh says 20 workers tested positive for the virus since the stadium re-opened to fans. \u201cMost of these workers have been with the Giants for decades and go back to the Candlestick days,\u201d said Singh. \u201cThey love the Giants and want the team to succeed. There\u2019s a lot of pride.\u201d</p>\n<p>In a statement to The Long Game, a Giants team official said, \u201cBon App\u00e9tit Management Company and Local 2 are currently engaged in collective bargaining negotiations.  We encourage both sides to work productively to reach an agreement as soon as possible.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote></div>",

Honestly, Pierce didn\u2019t even know he made a video. Here\u2019s what happened: In April, Pierce was playing poker at a friend\u2019s house in Los Angeles. There was drinking. And smoking. And strippers. And after a little too much drinking and smoking, Pierce decided to start an Instagram Live and, well, show off the strippers. He went on for a few minutes, riffing, he thought, for a couple hundred people. When he finished, he deleted it. <strong>He didn\u2019t know IG Lives can be recorded (they can) and reposted (it was). Pierce went home that night thinking no one noticed. He woke up the next day and discovered everyone had.</strong></p>\n<p>Still . . . sorry? \u201cFor what?\u201d asks Pierce. It\u2019s early July, and Pierce is reclining in a straight-backed chair at The Spot, a hookah lounge tucked into a strip mall in Encino, Calif. Around him, clusters of 20- and 30-somethings, many on laptops huddled over glowing screens, oblivious to the presence of basketball royalty. Hours earlier, Pierce was at home, a tailor dispatched by the Basketball Hall of Fame taking measurements for a suit to fit Pierce\u2019s 6\u20197\u201d frame. \u201cI haven\u2019t bought a new suit since I retired,\u201d says Pierce. But he needed something to wear in September for his enshrinement in Springfield, Mass., 90 miles from where he spent the bulk of his 19-year NBA career.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ESPN didn\u2019t ask for an apology. The relationship between Pierce and the network had become strained over the past two years. Pierce hated the travel. Network executives didn\u2019t think he was working hard enough. The video, industry sources told Sports Illustrated, was the last straw. \u201cI was done with them, anyway,\u201d says Pierce between pulls of lemon mint. <strong>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a great fit. There\u2019s a lot of stuff over there that you can\u2019t say. And you have to talk about LeBron all the time.\u201d</strong></p>\n<p>Pierce\u2019s longtime agent, Jeff Schwartz, suggested Pierce apologize anyway. Schwartz worried that the video might influence Hall voters. Pierce didn\u2019t. \u201cCome on, I didn\u2019t do anything illegal,\u201d says Pierce. \u201cThese motherf-----s in the Hall of Fame, some did [cocaine], f---ing battery. What the f--- did I do? I was just having a good time. All the people coming after me, half you motherf-----s do the same s---. You\u2019re just hiding it. And you all are married while you\u2019re doing it. I\u2019m divorced. I\u2019m retired. I\u2019m having fun.\u201d And if Hall voters had held it against him? \u201cListen,\u201d says Pierce, \u201cif I didn\u2019t make it with this class, it would be the biggest stiff job in Hall of Fame history.\u201d</p>\n<p>Schwartz suggested Pierce speak to Jerry Colangelo, the longtime NBA and USA Basketball exec who doubled as Hall chairman. Pierce agreed. In May, Pierce was in Springfield for former teammate Kevin Garnett\u2019s induction. At a dinner, he approached Colangelo. Pierce repeated: He didn\u2019t think he did anything wrong. \u201cWhat happened has nothing to do with what I did on the court,\u201d says Pierce.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Pierce has ideas. He\u2019s collaborating with Garnett on a few. The two are planning on launching a podcast. Pierce wants to do a show that follows the two of them traveling the world. \u201cJust doing all the s--- we couldn\u2019t do when we played,\u201d says Pierce. For example? \u201cSkydiving,\u201d says Pierce. \u201cMaybe a bull run in Spain. Get motorcycles and travel around. Experience different cultures, different foods. That would be so much fun.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p>Lmfaoooo this is just amazing. All of it. Everyone should read it.</p>\n<p>I would definitely watch that travel show with KG.</p></div>",

Richmond recalls meeting with Golden State general manager Don Nelson</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I walked in, and the first thing I said to him, I said, \u201cI know you traded me. But don\u2019t tell me you traded me to Sacramento Kings.\u201d And he said, \u201cI traded you to Sacramento Kings.\u201d And I said, \u201cThank you. I really appreciate it.\u201d And I turned around. And that was one of the worst days of my life, really.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It was unbelievable. <strong>I walk in, and the first thing I hear from one of the players, they go, \u201cWelcome to hell.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cAw, s\u2014. Damn.\u201d</strong> I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat? Oh my god.\u201d So, I sit down. Now, I\u2019m just sitting there. I have my clothes on and Spud Webb comes down sits right next to me. Spud whispers to me and goes, <strong>\u201cMan, I don\u2019t wish this on nobody. But I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here with me.\u201d</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Coincidentally, Sacramento was playing at Golden State the next day. Richmond told the Kings he wasn\u2019t prepared to play. Instead, he drove around Oakland. When he got home, he asked his wife the score of the game.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>She wouldn\u2019t even say anything. And I looked at it. We had lost by 61 points. <strong>I just started crying. I just started crying. I\u2019m like, \u201cMan, ain\u2019t no way.\u201d</strong></p>\n<p>I called my agent, and I \u2013 a young player, I didn\u2019t even know the rules. And I called him, and I said, \u201cIs there any way I can retire?\u201d <strong>I said, \u201cCan I just retire and come somewhere else?\u201d</strong> He said, \u201cAh, it doesn\u2019t work that way.\u201d And I was like, \u201cDamn.\u201d So, the story gets even worse.</p>\n<p>So, the next morning \u2013 I just bought my house, and I already decided I\u2019m not moving. I\u2019m just going to drive up every day. You know what I mean? I\u2019m just going to drive up. I\u2019m just going to commute. Whatever. Why not? So, I drive up, and we\u2019re supposed to have practice at like 10:30. I get there by like 9, trying to figure out, get there a little early. Walk in the locker room. No one is there. Ten o\u2019clock comes. No one there. 10:30 comes. No one there. I\u2019m still there. I stay there until noon. Randy Brown walks in, and I said, \u201cHey, what time practice?\u201d He said, \u201cAw man, we\u2019ve got two days off.\u201d I said, \u201cTwo days offs? We just f\u2014ing lost by 61.\u201d Two days off \u2013 oh my god. I said, \u201cOh my god. Aw, aw.\u201d</p>\n<p>That year, I decided I wasn\u2019t going to comb my hair. I wasn\u2019t going to do anything. <strong>I didn\u2019t comb my hair for the whole year.</strong></p>\n<p>We were only practicing like 30 minutes. And we sucked. I mean, we were so bad. And to be down at Sacrament and then, at that time, you see the newspaper. It\u2019s all Golden State Warriors. <strong>I cried all that year. I mean, it was tough. It was really tough.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/mitch-richmond-teammate-greeting-kings-204515464.html\">source</a></p>\n<p>Mitch Richmond shows up for some of the Kings' postgame shows sometimes looking blazed af, lol.</p></div>",

Posted by u/TylerIreland on r/timberwolves. </p>\n<p>[Disclaimer: This was said on live radio so I'm going to have to wait until the show is reuploaded later tonight and then add the clip-off to this post. If anyone managed to grab the clip let me know and I'll upload it to the post ASAP.]</p>\n<p>Earlier Report from Krawczynski: https://theathletic.com/2797725/2021/08/31/the-timberwolves-lack-of-activity-at-power-forward-all-seemingly-points-one-way-ben-simmons/</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In conversations with teams in Las Vegas, I came away with the impression that the Timberwolves were the team that was most active in talks to try to make a Simmons deal happen. Shams Charania reported earlier this week that Toronto has also inquired, but the market seems to be relatively quiet for Simmons at the moment. He\u2019s a fantastic player on defense and in transition, one the Wolves believe would fit beautifully with some of their more offensive-minded core. But his struggles in the playoffs, and the widely held belief that the Sixers must move him before the season opens and things get really contentious, has cooled the activity around him.</p>\n<p>As of right now, the Timberwolves do not have a trade package that offers Morey the win-now assets a team in championship mode wants. They are not going to put Karl-Anthony Towns into any type of multi-team deal to try to get the wheels moving and Anthony Edwards remains untouchable as well. Even if the Wolves did include D\u2019Angelo Russell in an offer \u2014 and they have talked all summer about building a team with Towns, Edwards and Russell around Simmons \u2014 it would not appear to be the magic bullet move that Morey needs to part ways with one of the best defensive players in the league \u2026 yet.</p>\n</blockquote></div>",

While the 76ers have told teams they are comfortable bringing Simmons back for the 2021-22 season, rival executives believe it\u2019s only a matter of when \u2014 not if \u2014 the All-Defensive team stalwart is moved. For now, all signs continue to point to Simmons\u2019 career in Philadelphia coming to an end.</p>\n<p>Center DeAndre Jordan and the Nets are working toward parting ways via contract buyout, sources tell me and Alex Schiffer. Jordan is increasingly unlikely to be part of the organization moving forward, but the sides have not made a final decision. Jordan did not appear in the Nets\u2019 last 16 games of the 2020-21 season and playoffs.</p>\n<p>Along with Brooklyn and Golden State, the Bulls are pursuing free-agent forward Paul Millsap, sources said. The Clippers are expressing interest in Millsap as well, sources said. Millsap, a battle-tested 15-year NBA veteran, finished a four-year stint in Denver in which the Nuggets had a 64.7 percent winning percentage and reached the Western Conference finals in 2020. At 35, Millsap\u2019s steal and block rates per 36 minutes were in line with his career average, and last season, his 56.5 percent true shooting percentage was around his career average. </p>\n<p>The Suns are among the contenders who have pursued Spurs forward Thaddeus Young, sources said. San Antonio acquired Young in a sign-and-trade \u2014 along with a first-round pick and two second-round picks \u2014 and now are expected to receive strong interest in the veteran forward from competitive teams. Young averaged 12.1 points, 6.2 rebounds and 4.3 assists while playing in 68 games (23 starts) and shooting 55.9 percent from the field a season ago.</p>\n</blockquote></div>",

The Complaint says that Paul, knowing that Noel was represented by Walters in 2017, told Noel that he \u201cwas a 100 million man\u201d and that Paul could get Noel a max deal if he terminated his relationship with Walters.</p>\n<p>This all allegedly went down at Simmons\u2019 birthday party in Los Angeles, where Paul was sitting next to Noel during the dinner portion of the event. Following the party, Noel parted ways with Walters and signed a Standard Player Agent Contract (SPAC) with Paul. Noel also purportedly took Paul\u2019s advice and ended prior ongoing negotiations with the Dallas Mavericks that would have paid him $70 million over 4-years, in favor of accepting a single-year, $4.1 million qualifying offer with the intention of later seeking a max deal on the free agent market. Paul earned a 4% commission on the qualifying offer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The situation became sour when Noel tore a ligament in his thumb, had surgery to repair the injury, and was forced to miss 42 games that season. According to the Complaint, Paul began to lose interest in Noel as a client.</p>\n<p>\u201cDuring the free agent season which began on July 1, 2018, and after Noel\u2019s one-year contract with Dallas expired, neither Paul nor anyone at Klutch Sports presented any real proposals to Noel in terms of strategies or ideas on how Noel might secure a long-term contract or even a significant contract for the following season,\u201d states the Complaint. \u201cIndeed, as the 2018 NBA free agent season began, no real offers or deals were presented to Noel on the first day of free agency.\u201d</p>\n<p>Noel says that Paul had nothing to do with Noel then signing with the Oklahoma City Thunder and that, instead, Russell Westbrook and Paul George recruited him to join them for that franchise. Noel signed a 2-year, $3.75 million league-minimum deal with the team, and Paul was paid a 2% commission.</p>\n<p>Paul is criticized for failing to make an effort to try to secure contracts or deals on Noel\u2019s behalf during the 2018-19 NBA season he spent with the Thunder and thereafter. Noel declined a player option on the second year of his deal with the Thunder and instead hit the free agent market. He received no offers from any other teams and was forced to sign another one-year league minimum contract with the Thunder.</p>\n<p>Noel allegedly learned from Brett Brown, who was coaching the Philadelphia 76ers at the time, that the 76ers front office had been trying to contact Paul to discuss a potential deal and that Paul refused to respond. This was purportedly the case with other team representatives who were reaching out as well.</p>\n<p>Eventually, Noel says that he contemplated terminating his representation relationship with Klutch Sports; however, he was persuaded by Lucas Newton of the company that they were working on a 3-year deal with the Thunder that should compensate Noel to the tune of $7 million to $10 million annually. Thus, Noel decided to stay in place with his agency of record.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Then, free agency hit and the first day was quiet. Noel says that he later learned that representatives from the Houston Rockets and Los Angeles Clippers wanted to discuss opportunities with Paul, but that they could not make contact. Leon Rose (who was formerly an agent at Creative Artists Agency but then the President of the New York Knicks) reached out about a deal and Noel ultimately signed a 1-year contract for $5 million.</p>\n<p>Noel finally terminated his relationship with Paul and Klutch Sports in December 2020 and says that the final straw was Noel learning that Paul \u201chad a history of mismanaging and ignoring other clients and costing them significant money.\u201d He believed that Paul and Klutch Sports were only focused on serving their marquee clients, and did not have the capacity to serve Noel as well as players such as Norris Cole or Shabazz Mohammad. After Noel\u2019s first season with the Knicks, he signed a 3-year deal for roughly $32 million and was represented by basketball agent George Langberg on that contract.</p>\n<p>Noel wants to be made whole for losing what he says is $58 million in lost earnings after being led to leave Walters and pass up an offer from the Mavericks for $70 million over 4 years. He says that Paul breached his fiduciary duty by inducing Noel to terminate his representation agreement with Walters and then by failing to do any meaningful work on Noel\u2019s behalf in terms of securing contracts, new endorsement deals, or by offering strategies to Noel on how to maximize his value and earnings.</p>\n</blockquote></div>",

You sign free agents, draft players, make trades, manage the finances, and try to build a dynasty without getting fired.</p>\n<p>Also, it's free. Actually free. That means no microtransactions, no virtual currency, no loot boxes, etc. <a href=\"https://play.basketball-gm.com/\">Click here to play in your web browser</a>, no download/install/login needed.</p>\n<p>I first posted a link here <a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1j1e6q/i_made_a_singleplayer_basketball_management/\">back in 2013</a>, and that's where I got my initial userbase from. The mods have graciously allowed me to post a link here every offseason since then, so I am very appreciative of this community for supporting me.</p>\n<p>Since last year, Basketball GM has kind of taken on a life of its own. During the lockdowns in 2020, I spent basically all my free time working on it. And earlier this year, I <a href=\"https://zengm.com/blog/2021/01/full-time-job/\">quit my day job</a> to focus on Basketball GM full time.</p>\n<p>The end result has been an incredible amount of new features. <a href=\"https://zengm.com/changelog/\">Here's a big giant list of them.</a> It's hard to even summarize the improvements since last year, but I'll try:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://zengm.com/blog/tag/real-players/\">Built-in rosters of real teams/players</a>, going all the way back to 1947. This includes expansion drafts, contraction (in the very old days), relocation, and real players in draft classes up to today. It also optionally includes all historical player stats. At least in some ways, you get a better UI to view real historical data in Basketball GM than on actual basketball websites!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>New features that enhance gameplay and add a lot of depth. A <a href=\"https://zengm.com/blog/2020/09/player-mood/\">new player mood system</a>, a <a href=\"https://zengm.com/blog/2020/08/smarter-contract-generation/\">fancy algorithm to set player contracts</a> (no more players going unsigned because AI teams ran out of money), <a href=\"https://zengm.com/blog/2020/08/jersey-numbers/\">jersey numbers and retired jerseys</a>, tracking of <a href=\"https://zengm.com/blog/2020/08/game-highs/\">game highs</a>, <a href=\"https://zengm.com/blog/2021/05/auto-ticket-prices/\">automatic ticket price optimization</a>, a new <a href=\"https://zengm.com/blog/2021/05/trade-finding-algorithm/\">trade finding algorithm</a>, <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/oQhZenq.png\">new advanced stats</a> (BPM and VORP), players can <a href=\"https://zengm.com/blog/2021/05/play-through-injuries/\">play through minor injuries</a>, <a href=\"https://zengm.com/blog/2020/07/game-sim-realism/\">more realistic game simulation</a>, and more.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Added a bunch of new pages to let you view your league in new ways. <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/GUsHCOS.png\">League stats</a>, your <a href=\"https://zengm.com/blog/2020/08/gm-history/\">GM history</a> across multiple teams, <a href=\"https://zengm.com/blog/2020/11/trade-details/\">trade summaries</a> to see who won or lost a trade, <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/Pl5ITWR.png\">award races</a>, <a href=\"https://zengm.com/blog/2021/02/head-to-head/\">head-to-head team results</a>, <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/9EzWXVK.png\">player game logs</a>, leaguewide <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/NW6UNxO.png\">injuries overview</a>, the <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/pqlZaGf.png\">daily schedule</a>, a <a href=\"https://zengm.com/blog/2020/06/news-feed/\">news feed</a>, and <a href=\"https://zengm.com/blog/tag/frivolities/\">tons of new frivolities</a>, including my personal favorite <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/NEmdu7e.png\">the GOAT Lab</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>There is a <a href=\"https://zengm.com/blog/2020/11/settings-redesign/\">new settings UI</a>, and a ton of new settings: the <a href=\"https://zengm.com/blog/2020/08/elam-ending/\">Elam Ending</a>, more <a href=\"https://basketball-gm.com/manual/customization/schedule-settings/\">schedule</a>/<a href=\"https://zengm.com/blog/2021/08/playoff-settings/\">playoff</a> customization, <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/kjuwN4S.png\">inflation</a>, <a href=\"https://zengm.com/blog/2021/02/customizable-tiebreakers/\">customizable tiebreakers</a>, <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/OiGm4FC.png\">customizable injuries</a>, <a href=\"https://zengm.com/blog/2020/05/beta-real-rosters-back-to-1956/\">gameplay settings</a> (like how often players shoot 3 pointers), the <a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/ivlhui/new_god_mode_option_to_set_the_number_of_players/\"># of players on the court</a> (you can make a 3v3 league), and many more.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://zengm.com/blog/2020/06/league-creation-options/\">Added tons of new \"game modes\".</a> Challenge modes like \"no draft picks\" can be fun to try to overcome. \"Groundhog Day\" lets you play the same season over and over. <a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/gq13b4/new_option_random_debuts_when_creating_a_real/\">\"Random debuts\"</a> lets you shuffle all current and historical real players and randomly puts them in future draft classes. <a href=\"https://zengm.com/blog/2020/08/spectator-mode/\">\"Spectator mode\"</a> lets you just sit back and watch a league, without having to control a team.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>New God Mode stuff to let you exert complete control over your league.

Or <a href=\"https://hockey.zengm.com/\">try the hockey version, which is also new this year</a>. So much new stuff!</p>\n<p>Feedback is always welcome, either here or on /r/BasketballGM.

I remember watching Klay the whole time, and he never flinched. He never wavered. The very next offensive possession, ball swings, goes to Klay. He takes the first shot and makes a 3. I\u2019m thinking, \u201cThis kid is an ice-cold killer.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ezeli: One game, I think we were up three with about 15 seconds left and somebody threw the ball to Klay.
