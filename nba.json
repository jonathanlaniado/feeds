KD argues these fans don\u2019t really know what they\u2019re talking about. Here is the full argument, for those that don\u2019t have Twitter: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Twitter user</strong>: Please @NBA adopt more @FIBA rules and let us see the best really think the game and play the game like it's meant to be played</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>KD</strong>: I swear yall just be yappin. What rules u wanna see man?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Twitter user</strong>: I want to see the 3 seconds back and that's it.... you disagree?  More movement less ISO / Quicker Decisions - keep 3s the same as NBA - Can't knock off the rim (that's dumb)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>KD</strong>: If u want to eliminate defensive 3 seconds then the games will be slower.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Twitter user</strong>: I don't disagree with that (i'm 40 so i'm late 90s basketball lo)  ... but more schemes &amp; quicker decisions offensively not as much holding \nNBA is fine man lol it's the best product in the world with the best players PERIOD - would love to see it ... i'm watching yall do it now</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>KD</strong>: The beauty of basketball is not callin all them sets but playing off instincts and lettin the talent dictate the game..gettin out in transition, driving and kicking, playing random basketball. U want a trick play every possession like it\u2019s football. That\u2019s not why our game is beautiful</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Twitter user</strong>: That works when your team is stacked 1-5. It does \u2018t work when you need to get the best out of every player on the floor in different aspects (screens, passes, cuts) when your team has guys all playing roles, you need play calling.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>KD</strong>: Random basketball!! U not comprehending what I\u2019m saying. U can RANDOMLY set a screen, RANDOMLY back cut, RANDOMLY make a pass to the open man. Focus on what I\u2019m saying </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So do you guys agree with KD that FIBA rules wouldn\u2019t make NBA basketball \u201cmore beautiful\u201d? </p>",
