In dialogue with league-office personnel and players union officials, the Sixers appear to be within their rights to withhold that lucrative check. </p>\n<p>In turn, there have been growing whispers this week among NBA sources with knowledge of the situation that Simmons could respond by actually reporting to Philadelphia in the coming days, but maintaining that he is injured and unable to compete. Simmons has had noted knee and back injuries in the previous two seasons. </p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/jakelfischer/status/1444004600940572674?s=21</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For \u201cSeinfeld\u201d fans, this is in full Costanza/Play Now territory.</p></div>",

But if I was on the team and I was a guy that had a say on the team, I would say, \u2018You have to get him out of here; he\u2019s a distraction.\u2019 They have a really good shot to win. With him there, they have an even better shot. But I don\u2019t want to come to practice every day having to answer questions about him. I\u2019ve been through that before, and it\u2019s nerve-wracking. We want to come to play and win and focus on what we have to do. We don\u2019t want to focus on him not doing this or not doing that. Or the NBA can say, \u2018If you don\u2019t want to follow the laws and the guidelines, we\u2019ll forfeit all of your money.\u2019 I think a lot of times when you have the guaranteed contract, guys think they can do whatever they want to do. I\u2019m not bashing him. It\u2019s his decision. But they\u2019re trying to win there and need to get this done. If everyone else on the team could do it, he should think about that.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p>I love this take from Shaq.</p></div>",

It\u2019s not about 'I, I, I.\u2019 What about the people around you?\u201d</p>\n<p>The coach said his team\u2019s vaccinati\u043en rate is around the league average and if presented with a scenario of an unvaccinated player coming to him, unsure of what to do, he said: \u201cI\u2019d tell him what I know. When we were young, the flu sh\u043et was coming out and we took that. And I\u2019d ask, \u2018How can I help you be safe and others around you be safe?\u2019 I gotta trust you\u2019ll do the right thing. But that\u2019s a lot of trust.\u201d</p>\n<p>The graduates of Y\u043eu\u0422ube University and the brilliant historians who vacillate between favored phrases \u201c\u0422uskegee Experiment\u201d to \u201cD\u043eing my \u043ewn research\u201d appear to have very little knowledge of either \u2014 it\u2019s just used to shut up opposition, as if they\u2019re picking up a beaker, a syringe and some goggles any time soon.</p>\n<p>But in giving them the platf\u043erm, we\u2019re giving them what they want. They have access to the greatest d\u043ectors in the world and will c\u043ensult them for anything from the common cold to a torn-up knee, but they have apparently disc\u043evered something all the world\u2019s greatest scientists have missed.</p>\n</blockquote></div>",

This has put into question his availability for some games for the start of the season. As of Aug. 20, the city of San Francisco has required proof of vaccination for large indoor events.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Warriors declined to comment on Wiggins' situation late Wednesday night, citing player privacy protocols. In a statement to the Chronicle, the San Francisco Department of Public Health said it would not comment specifically on Wiggins' situation -- unless the NBA grants him a religious exemption.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"To each his own, really. Whoever wants to get it, can get it; whoever doesn't want to get it, don't get it,\" Wiggins said on March 22. \"Right now, I'm not getting it, but it's no knock on anyone else that's getting it. I make my own decisions. But right now, I decided not to get it.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Wiggins at the time said he was waiting for more information.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Yeah, I don't really see myself getting it any time soon, unless I'm forced to somehow,\" Wiggins said in March. \"Other than that, I'm good.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Chronicle reported that the Warriors put Wiggins in touch with an Oakland doctor to discuss the hesitancy in getting the vaccine, but he did not change his stance.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Full Article: <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/32261240/warriors-andrew-wiggins-remains-unvaccinated-source-says-jeopardizing-availability-golden-state\">https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/32261240/warriors-andrew-wiggins-remains-unvaccinated-source-says-jeopardizing-availability-golden-state</a></p></div>",

Had the Warriors beaten the Lakers they would have been guaranteed at least three more home playoff games in May.</p>\n<p><strong>\u201cLeBron hitting a three shouldn\u2019t cost people their health coverage,\u201d</strong> said Anand Singh, president of UNITE HERE local 2, the union that represents 930 concession workers at Chase Center and Oracle Park, where the Giants play. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely ridiculous to take away workers\u2019 health care in a pandemic over something that\u2019s no fault of their own. That\u2019s one of the reasons we have chosen to fight.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Like most professional sports teams in the United States, both the Warriors and the Giants use a subcontractor to handle food preparation and sales at their home games. In this case, concession workers at Warriors and Giants games work for a company called Bon Appetite.</p>\n<p>Last Saturday, 96.7% of concession workers at Oracle Park voted to strike for a number of reasons. Workers I spoke to cited the fact that they\u2019re scared of losing health care over scheduling issues, frustrated they haven\u2019t been given hazard pay during the Covid-19 pandemic, and upset that the Giants are allowing fans to order food from them without wearing masks. \u201cThere is signage up but there is no enforcement,\u201d Singh said. (I attended last Saturday and Sunday\u2019s games and found this to be accurate).</p>\n<p>In a statement to The Long Game, a team official said, \u201cThe Giants make the health and safety of everyone working and visiting Oracle Park a top priority.  We operate our venue in compliance with local and state health requirements.\u201d (The Warriors had not yet returned a request for comment at press time).</p>\n<p>While they continue to work during a pandemic, concession workers are asking for an additional three dollars an hour in hazard pay. They haven\u2019t yet gone on strike, but on Friday the union announced it would begin holding sign-ups for picketing outside Oracle Park.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Julie Nordman has been working concessions at Giants games for thirty years and voted to strike. She told me that the 2020 season without fans was a nightmare, during which she had no income and no medical insurance. \u201cI got Covid and spent three and a half weeks in bed,\u201d said Nordman. \u201cMy husband and I were sick on our 36th wedding anniversary.\u201d</p>\n<p>Nordman manages thirteen employees at the Doggie Diner hot dog stand behind home plate and says she loves working Giants games. \u201cI raised all three of my daughters on baseball,\u201d said Nordman. \u201cThe atmosphere with all our co-workers and season tickets holders is like a family. I just love it.\u201d Nordman said a season ticket holder in her section, a teacher, heard about their vote to strike and wanted to write a check to cover the additional three dollars an hour for every employee working that night. \u201cThese are the kind of people we serve every day.\u201d said Nordman. \u201cThis is why so many of us stay in these jobs for thirty, forty years.\u201d</p>\n<p>But May was also a bad month for Giants concession workers. The team only had nine home games on their schedule, so all the concession workers lost health care for the month of July. \u201cUsually they\u2019ll come up with another event like a graduation or a high school game to get us to ten so we can keep our coverage,\u201d said Nordman. \u201cBut because of Covid that didn\u2019t happen. So we had a lot of people who couldn\u2019t afford their medications in July so they just went without. It\u2019s really tough.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The day the Giants schedule comes out is also a scary day for Rhonda Mitchell, who has been working concessions at Giants games for twenty-one years. (She currently manages the McGraw Derby Grille on the top deck.) Mitchell, a native San Franciscan, says she\u2019s been a Giants fan since she was six years old. She remembers watching her all-time favorite Willie Mays make spectacular catches at Candlestick Park like it was yesterday. With no games last season to work, Mitchell was forced to rely on unemployment and savings to scrape by and pay her monthly bills.</p>\n<p>I visited Mitchell\u2019s stand and, because of the chicken fingers and garlic fries, it was one of the busier areas in the park. In the fifth inning of Sunday\u2019s game the line stretched for 30 minutes. \u201cI love the fans but they should know how hard we work,\u201d said Mitchell. \u201cIt may seem easy to get all that food to hundreds of people but it\u2019s not.\u201d Concession workers arrive four hours before first pitch and stay until about an hour after last pitch.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Singh says the union has been negotiating for several months on a new contract that includes the pay raise and new health and safety protocols. \u201cThese people live on a razor\u2019s edge,\u201d said Singh. \u201cThey can\u2019t afford to catch Covid and get sick and lose their health care.\u201d Singh says 20 workers tested positive for the virus since the stadium re-opened to fans. \u201cMost of these workers have been with the Giants for decades and go back to the Candlestick days,\u201d said Singh. \u201cThey love the Giants and want the team to succeed. There\u2019s a lot of pride.\u201d</p>\n<p>In a statement to The Long Game, a Giants team official said, \u201cBon App\u00e9tit Management Company and Local 2 are currently engaged in collective bargaining negotiations.  We encourage both sides to work productively to reach an agreement as soon as possible.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote></div>",

Honestly, Pierce didn\u2019t even know he made a video. Here\u2019s what happened: In April, Pierce was playing poker at a friend\u2019s house in Los Angeles. There was drinking. And smoking. And strippers. And after a little too much drinking and smoking, Pierce decided to start an Instagram Live and, well, show off the strippers. He went on for a few minutes, riffing, he thought, for a couple hundred people. When he finished, he deleted it. <strong>He didn\u2019t know IG Lives can be recorded (they can) and reposted (it was). Pierce went home that night thinking no one noticed. He woke up the next day and discovered everyone had.</strong></p>\n<p>Still . . . sorry? \u201cFor what?\u201d asks Pierce. It\u2019s early July, and Pierce is reclining in a straight-backed chair at The Spot, a hookah lounge tucked into a strip mall in Encino, Calif. Around him, clusters of 20- and 30-somethings, many on laptops huddled over glowing screens, oblivious to the presence of basketball royalty. Hours earlier, Pierce was at home, a tailor dispatched by the Basketball Hall of Fame taking measurements for a suit to fit Pierce\u2019s 6\u20197\u201d frame. \u201cI haven\u2019t bought a new suit since I retired,\u201d says Pierce. But he needed something to wear in September for his enshrinement in Springfield, Mass., 90 miles from where he spent the bulk of his 19-year NBA career.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ESPN didn\u2019t ask for an apology. The relationship between Pierce and the network had become strained over the past two years. Pierce hated the travel. Network executives didn\u2019t think he was working hard enough. The video, industry sources told Sports Illustrated, was the last straw. \u201cI was done with them, anyway,\u201d says Pierce between pulls of lemon mint. <strong>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a great fit. There\u2019s a lot of stuff over there that you can\u2019t say. And you have to talk about LeBron all the time.\u201d</strong></p>\n<p>Pierce\u2019s longtime agent, Jeff Schwartz, suggested Pierce apologize anyway. Schwartz worried that the video might influence Hall voters. Pierce didn\u2019t. \u201cCome on, I didn\u2019t do anything illegal,\u201d says Pierce. \u201cThese motherf-----s in the Hall of Fame, some did [cocaine], f---ing battery. What the f--- did I do? I was just having a good time. All the people coming after me, half you motherf-----s do the same s---. You\u2019re just hiding it. And you all are married while you\u2019re doing it. I\u2019m divorced. I\u2019m retired. I\u2019m having fun.\u201d And if Hall voters had held it against him? \u201cListen,\u201d says Pierce, \u201cif I didn\u2019t make it with this class, it would be the biggest stiff job in Hall of Fame history.\u201d</p>\n<p>Schwartz suggested Pierce speak to Jerry Colangelo, the longtime NBA and USA Basketball exec who doubled as Hall chairman. Pierce agreed. In May, Pierce was in Springfield for former teammate Kevin Garnett\u2019s induction. At a dinner, he approached Colangelo. Pierce repeated: He didn\u2019t think he did anything wrong. \u201cWhat happened has nothing to do with what I did on the court,\u201d says Pierce.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Pierce has ideas. He\u2019s collaborating with Garnett on a few. The two are planning on launching a podcast. Pierce wants to do a show that follows the two of them traveling the world. \u201cJust doing all the s--- we couldn\u2019t do when we played,\u201d says Pierce. For example? \u201cSkydiving,\u201d says Pierce. \u201cMaybe a bull run in Spain. Get motorcycles and travel around. Experience different cultures, different foods. That would be so much fun.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p>Lmfaoooo this is just amazing. All of it.

Richmond recalls meeting with Golden State general manager Don Nelson</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I walked in, and the first thing I said to him, I said, \u201cI know you traded me. But don\u2019t tell me you traded me to Sacramento Kings.\u201d And he said, \u201cI traded you to Sacramento Kings.\u201d And I said, \u201cThank you. I really appreciate it.\u201d And I turned around. And that was one of the worst days of my life, really.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It was unbelievable. <strong>I walk in, and the first thing I hear from one of the players, they go, \u201cWelcome to hell.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cAw, s\u2014. Damn.\u201d</strong> I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat? Oh my god.\u201d So, I sit down. Now, I\u2019m just sitting there. I have my clothes on and Spud Webb comes down sits right next to me. Spud whispers to me and goes, <strong>\u201cMan, I don\u2019t wish this on nobody. But I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here with me.\u201d</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Coincidentally, Sacramento was playing at Golden State the next day. Richmond told the Kings he wasn\u2019t prepared to play. Instead, he drove around Oakland. When he got home, he asked his wife the score of the game.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>She wouldn\u2019t even say anything. And I looked at it. We had lost by 61 points. <strong>I just started crying. I just started crying. I\u2019m like, \u201cMan, ain\u2019t no way.\u201d</strong></p>\n<p>I called my agent, and I \u2013 a young player, I didn\u2019t even know the rules. And I called him, and I said, \u201cIs there any way I can retire?\u201d <strong>I said, \u201cCan I just retire and come somewhere else?\u201d</strong> He said, \u201cAh, it doesn\u2019t work that way.\u201d And I was like, \u201cDamn.\u201d So, the story gets even worse.</p>\n<p>So, the next morning \u2013 I just bought my house, and I already decided I\u2019m not moving. I\u2019m just going to drive up every day. You know what I mean? I\u2019m just going to drive up. I\u2019m just going to commute. Whatever. Why not? So, I drive up, and we\u2019re supposed to have practice at like 10:30. I get there by like 9, trying to figure out, get there a little early. Walk in the locker room. No one is there. Ten o\u2019clock comes. No one there. 10:30 comes. No one there. I\u2019m still there. I stay there until noon. Randy Brown walks in, and I said, \u201cHey, what time practice?\u201d He said, \u201cAw man, we\u2019ve got two days off.\u201d I said, \u201cTwo days offs? We just f\u2014ing lost by 61.\u201d Two days off \u2013 oh my god. I said, \u201cOh my god. Aw, aw.\u201d</p>\n<p>That year, I decided I wasn\u2019t going to comb my hair. I wasn\u2019t going to do anything. <strong>I didn\u2019t comb my hair for the whole year.</strong></p>\n<p>We were only practicing like 30 minutes. And we sucked. I mean, we were so bad. And to be down at Sacrament and then, at that time, you see the newspaper. It\u2019s all Golden State Warriors. <strong>I cried all that year. I mean, it was tough. It was really tough.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/mitch-richmond-teammate-greeting-kings-204515464.html\">source</a></p>\n<p>Mitch Richmond shows up for some of the Kings' postgame shows sometimes looking blazed af, lol.</p></div>",
