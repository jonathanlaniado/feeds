His lips would curl, and then he\u2019d let out a grunt.</p>\n<p>He was trying to look more aggressive, less adorable; more intimidating, less innocent. He needed a new identity heading into his second NBA season\u2014one vastly different from the goofy, endearing rookie discovering smoothies for the first time.</p>\n<p>He needed to get mean.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe had to practice it because he\u2019s not that guy,\u201d says Skip Robinson, then Bucks vice president of community relations and player development. \u201cHe\u2019s a lovable guy. A nice gentleman.\u201d</p>\n<p>Giannis didn\u2019t want to be seen as a nice gentleman on the court; he wanted to be seen as someone who would tear your heart out. He tried to pattern his scowl after Russell Westbrook\u2019s scowl. Giannis loved Westbrook: his demeanor, his speed, but especially his scowl. Giannis came into practice once, scowling and grunting. \u201cThis is my new thing,\u201d Giannis told his teammates.</p>\n<p>They ignored him. Laughed a bit. But Giannis insisted on impressing them: He flexed his muscles after bench-pressing and flashed his scowl again, hoping his teammates would appreciate the intensity of his grunt. \u201cBro,\u201d Brandon Knight told him, \u201cyou still don\u2019t have any muscles. Relaaaaax.\u201d</p>\n<p>Giannis\u2019s teammates found it hilarious when he\u2019d attempt the scowl after a dunk, something he started doing toward the end of his rookie season. The first time he did it, against the Pistons, he ran back to the other end of the court with so much aggression even Caron Butler was surprised. \u201cI didn\u2019t know where the hell that came from,\u201d Butler says, laughing.</p>\n<p>Afterward, his teammates asked him, \u201cWhat is that? Where\u2019d you get that from?\u201d They assumed he\u2019d learned the scowl from YouTube\u2014where he learned everything in those days.</p>\n<p>Giannis laughed. \u201cOh,\u201d Giannis said casually in a \u201cthis old thing?\u201d kind of tone, \u201cI took it from Westbrook.\u201d</p>\n<p>Giannis\u2019s scowl seemed out of place. Manufactured. \u201cWe\u2019d be like, \u2018Oh, he must have practiced that at home today,\u2019\u201d Knight says. The scowl was coming along, but it still wasn\u2019t loud enough, mean enough. Convincing enough. \u201cYou gotta work on your roar,\u201d Knight would sarcastically advise Giannis. \u201cYou gotta work on your yell. We gotta get you right, man.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Lmfaoo this is amazing</p>",

            "content_html": "<p><a href=\"https://www.basketballnews.com/stories/metta-world-peace-on-team-usa\">Source</a></p>\n<p><em>On the subject of international basketball, you played a season overseas and played under FIBA rules. We\u2019re about to start the Olympics with Team USA undergoing some changes. Bradley Beal is off the team. Kevin Love is off the team. Keldon Johnson and JaVale McGee joined the team. How do you see the Olympics playing out for Team USA?</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Metta World Peace: \u201cFor me, the Olympics is a bitter situation for me. I love the Olympics, and I feel like I\u2019ve been shortchanged. Even though I was a head case and a real volatile player when I did play, I just always felt like I should have had an opportunity to play [for Team USA]. The year I was going to play, I got suspended - and when you talk about legacy, that gold medal is very important to legacy. And I was a player, third-team All-NBA. I should have had a tryout. I remember when I didn\u2019t get called for the Olympics, and I thought at least I\u2019d play on the team that played against the people who got selected (the Select Team). And when that didn\u2019t happen, I called my agent and said, \u2018What the hell is going on here?!\u2019 And we could not get no response. So then, I had to call the Olympic office myself. And I got no return call. And I was like, \u2018Just let me try out.\u2019 I understand I wasn\u2019t the greatest player to be around at that time and some players did not want to play with me, but I was like, \u2018Give me a chance to take that player\u2019s spot.' At that time, in that era, my defense was so incredible, I was going to take someone\u2019s spot. I\u2019m 100 percent sure.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>That would have been the 2004 Olympics in Athens when the U.S. lost to Puerto Rico by 19 in the opener and ended up taking home the bronze.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Metta World Peace: \u201cYeah, you see what I\u2019m saying? We [wouldn\u2019t have] taken home a bronze. We\u2019d have a gold. I wasn\u2019t on that team. The USA had a goal in 2004 and there\u2019s no way we lose with me on that team. There\u2019s no way. How? I\u2019m averaging 24 and the best defender in the world at that point in time. I got Defensive Player of the Year in between sharks and blue whales, Ben Wallace and Duncan and Garnett. This is who I had to navigate through in order to get that award. Hall of Famers. With that being said, I understand why. But I just want people to hear: If I could rewind time, that is something that is supposed to be on my resume. Now, granted, a lot of things are not on my resume because of me, but I got Defensive Player of the Year, I was close to being MVP one year, I got champion, All-Star, everything but the Olympics. But I\u2019ve been to the Olympics in high school. I got the USA high school history. One day, I hope they pick me. Sometimes they pick veterans, they pick guys who don\u2019t play [anymore]. I hope I can play in the Olympics; I deserve it just as much as anybody, I believe. Some people would argue that other people deserve it also. That\u2019s true, but I am the one yapping about it. So hopefully one day an honorary jersey, end of the bench. I even told them I would get the water. I literally called the office. I told my agent, \u2018Can I even be the water boy? Something?\u2019 So every time someone brings up the Olympians, I rant, I rant I rant. I am an Olympian, for sure. I am an Olympian, a gold medalist, and I truly believe that.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen you look at it from a basketball standpoint, in terms of being that professional at that age, I wasn\u2019t. But I was a hell of a basketball player, and I felt like a hell of an American basketball player, one of the best American basketball players in the world. And although I\u2019m very much from Queensbridge and as urban as it gets in the NBA, at the same time I always wanted to represent the USA. And another reason why I wanted to represent the USA: Chris Mullin was an Olympian, I went to St. John\u2019s. Vern Fleming was a gold medalist Olympian, and Vern Fleming is from my neighborhood and everybody knows where I\u2019m from. Vern Fleming experienced all the things I talked about, just picture those situation with Vern Fleming, and he was an Olympian. He\u2019s from the same block, the same exact block as me. There\u2019s a lot of reasons why I wanted to be an Olympian. No matter what anybody says, I am an Olympian, I am a gold medalist. I didn\u2019t cut myself from that team.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>",

Despite that, its the very first comment including him whatsover on r/nba so it earns a place here.</p>\n<p>The first comment actually <em>focused</em> on Middleton is from two weeks before the draft, where what I assume was a Thunder fan comments on a post asking about what player they think their team will draft: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/v5ix1/who_do_you_think_your_team_will_draft/c51n4e6?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">\"We really need someone who can come off the bench for KD who is an actual SF. Not a tweener, but a swingman. </a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/v5ix1/who_do_you_think_your_team_will_draft/c51n4e6?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">I'm thinking Khris Middleton from Texas A&amp;M. He appears that he would fit pretty well in this system.\"</a></p>\n<p><strong>AFTER THE DRAFT</strong></p>\n<p>The first mention of him after the draft is someone confused about <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/vqrxl/game_thread_2012_nba_draft/c573ozl?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">\"Why Khris Middleton with Doron Lamb, Tyshawn Taylor, and Darius Miller still on the board?\"</a></p>\n<p>In case you're wondering about the fate of those players, Doron Lamb was waived in 2014 and is playing basketball in Europe, Tyshawn Taylor was used by legendary Mavs coach Jason Kidd to get a free timeout by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEqU7JHkfu0\">bumping into him</a> and then waived, and Darius Miller was infamously a walking TPE, although probably the best player out of the three.</p>\n<p>Some more serious draft analysis had him pegged as <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/vsvmf/can_someone_post_this_insider_draft_grades/c57bun6?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">\"a smooth scorer with a great midrange game\"</a>. It's a nice read and seeing the optimism about MKG was a blast of nostalgia.</p>\n<p><strong>THE TRADE</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1jdllz/knight_middleton_and_krastov_to_be_traded_to_the/\">The trade thread</a>.</p>\n<p>To sum up the comments in a nutshell - the name Middleton is mentioned six times and half of those are jokes about Kate Middleton.</p>\n<p>If you ever needed proof Middleton was a throw-in in the trade here it is. Pretty much all of the discussion being had is about Knight/Jennings, although there are a few takes that have aged alarmingly well.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1jdllz/knight_middleton_and_krastov_to_be_traded_to_the/cbdm1b7?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">\"I have a feeling this one is gonna bite the Pistons in the ass.\"</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1jdllz/knight_middleton_and_krastov_to_be_traded_to_the/cbdu1l3?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">\"I think the steal of this trade might have been Khris Middleton. He had flashes last year as a rookie in limited minutes, and if the Bucks learned anything from losing Tobias Harris, it's gonna be to play their youngsters like John Henson and Khris very heavily to see what they are truly capable of.\"</a></p>\n<p>Funnily enough the person who made the comment, /u/noworldforeric also had <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1euzhs/here_is_my_first_round_2013_nba_mock_draft_rnba/ca40cgd?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">a great take on Giannis</a> that ended up in my last post as well, what a visionary. Wonder if we'll be seeing any other takes from him later on in this series...</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1jdllz/knight_middleton_and_krastov_to_be_traded_to_the/cbdmg9i?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">\"Middleton is gonna be dope, I wonder if Bucks will figure that out\"</a></p>\n<p>Aside from that, the thread is just discussion about the Pistons so unless you're in the mood for takes about the Pistons that have aged terribly I wouldn't recommend going through it.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><strong>Some takes around the trade that have aged well</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1jkqp2/is_it_possible_for_both_teams_to_win_the/cbfx4ip?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">\"As a Pistons fan, you should be more excited about the extra pieces in this trade than BK.</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1jkqp2/is_it_possible_for_both_teams_to_win_the/cbfyej8?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">Middleton could be the best player out of this entire trade. He has a shit on of \"Arron Afflalo\" potential. He's a guy Pistons fans were very excited about.

So basically just BK and 2 guys who won't make the Bucks roster.\"</a></p>\n<p>Funnily enough, once again both these takes are from a user that also featured in my Giannis post <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1fnklc/2013_rnba_mock_draft_15_picks_milwaukee_bucks/cac9lny?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">who predicted that he would be a huge star</a>.</p>\n<p>Honestly I'd say this is the perfect example of how much luck goes into these predictions. Someone with one of the best takes on Giannis also had terrible takes on Middleton, just because of how variable and random trying to predict the potential/ceiling of a player is.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1jtpea/brandon_knight_and_khris_middleton_pose_in_front/cbiwype?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">\"I honestly don't know how Middleton made to the NBA.

Either way first part is just weird given he was on the watchlist for the Wooden Award in college and unanimous addition to the All-Big 12 team.</p>\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> An explanation from /u/nibbinoo8 and /u/BEE_REAL_ :</p>\n<p>Deandre Jordan also went to Texas A&amp;M and was seen as a complete disappointment, but managed to be a great player anyways, so he was suggesting that there was a chance Middleton would have a similar career path. </p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1jlyth/what_move_has_your_team_made_in_the_past_few/cbg7nwz?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">\"I loved that trade. We didn't give up any picks or expiring contracts, and Middleton and Kravstov weren't going to do much of anything. It was effectively a straight up Knight for Jennings trade, and Knight's super turnover prone. Sure, Jennings is immature, but he's still an upgrade over what we had before. It's like Joe D's brain is finally working again\"</a></p>\n<p>Well uh, he was right about Kravstov I guess?</p>\n<p><strong>NEXT UP</strong></p>\n<p>The next players I'll be doing (in order of appearance according to requests) are Jokic, Draymond, Steph, Gobert and then finally a brief compilation of meme/fan favourite players like Caruso and Tacko.</p>\n<p>Any other suggestions/feedback are welcome!</p>",

There have been reports in recent weeks that Houston has interest in trading up with Detroit to take Cunningham, but the vast majority of speculation from other teams has centered on Green as the presumptive fit at No. 2. His ability to create his own shot gives him a chance to be a legitimate offensive fulcrum, and the Rockets are positioned to take a swing on upside. For what it\u2019s worth, Green\u2019s camp is thought to prefer Houston as a destination, rather than landing in Cleveland one pick later. Devin Booker\u2019s evolution from promising scorer into a well-rounded perimeter centerpiece provides a blueprint for Green\u2019s development, with his exceptional athleticism giving him major upside.</p>\n</blockquote>",
