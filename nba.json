A lot of them are from so long ago and some of them should be changed. We're in a different time now.</p>\n<p>You\u2019ve joined the board of Oregon LIVE Certified. Why was that important to you?</p>\n<p>Sustainability has always been important to my family, not just on the wine side but because we care about the environment. We want this place to be better than it is now. And better than it was when we found it after we leave. We care about the future of our society and especially, with having kids, we want them to be able to live in a safe, healthy environment.</p>\n<p>We also want to make sure that the employees and people that are on the farms are paid well and treated well. Obviously lately there's been a situation where a lot of the farm workers who are not from the United States are in difficult positions. People who have been in the United States for 10 years, even 30 years, and are either being detained on farms or being detained outside of courthouses. Some people have even had court cases scheduled, then the court case gets dismissed and they're arrested.</p>\n<p>How vital is this workforce to the wine industry?</p>\n<p>Immigrants are vital to not only wine, but so many different parts of society. I think people are starting to realize that. But for those of us in the wine business, understanding the importance of harvest and farming land and how many people play a vital role in that \u2014 the business won't survive without immigrants.</p>\n<p>Who have been some of your favorite NBA colleagues to share wine with?</p>\n<p>I'm from Ohio, so I've obviously drank wine with LeBron. Kevin Love has a great palate. He drinks a variety of wine. Channing Frye. Carmelo Anthony always brings some unique wines and he\u2019s heavy on white burgundy. Terry Stotts has a good palate. Coach Willie Green enjoys his wine. I've shared some different Pinots with him. It\u2019s cool to drink with players, but I would say I enjoy drinking wine with my wife the most. We've got special occasion bottles. Birthday and celebratory bottles. Birth year bottles. We enjoy opening a bottle and sharing stories. We've had some unique experiences over the course of our life.</p>\n<p>Would you be happy if one day someone knew nothing about your sports career and said \u2018you're the guy that makes that wine?\u2019</p>\n<p>That would be cool. That\u2019s something that takes time. Maybe 15 years from now someone will say \u2018he played basketball? I thought he was the guy from that winery.\u2019 That would be a great moment. One day I\u2019ll just be Jacobi and Margaux\u2019s dad and the guy who makes wine.

            "content_html": "<p>Everyone around the league will be watching to see if the investigation by the firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz, which led the league\u2019s investigation into the Sterling tape, will, if cap circumvention is proven, lead to severe sanctions against the NBA\u2019s richest owner.</p>\n<p>You may recall when the league suspended former Suns governor Robert Sarver for a year and fined him $10 million in 2022, after a 10-month investigation by Wachtell, Lipton into allegations of a toxic work environment for women and minorities in the Suns\u2019 organization, LeBron James and Chris Paul expressed disappointment with the NBA\u2019s discipline.

Of course, the Clippers have denied they\u2019ve done anything wrong. Of course, the burden of proof is on the league to prove malfeasance up near Playa Vista, Calif., where the Clippers were headquartered in 2021, when all this began.</p>\n<p>Smoking guns tend to be hard to find, though Torre\u2019s dogged work over the last several months has unearthed quite the road map toward one.</p>\n<p>If the NBA finds the Clippers guilty, it can\u2019t do what it did in 2018 to the Mavericks, after a seven-month investigation that was initiated by the team, with league oversight, corroborated the findings of a Sports Illustrated story detailing a toxic work environment for women throughout the organization. The Mavs\u2019 \u201cpunishment,\u201d such as it was, was what the league obliquely called a $10 million \u201cdonation\u201d that Cuban would make toward organizations \u201ccommitted to supporting the leadership and development of women in the sports industry and combating domestic violence.\u201d</p>\n<p>Which was noble, and helpful, but did not include the word \u201cfine\u201d anywhere.</p>\n<p>There was no such equivocating when Silver threw Sterling out of the league in 2014, after the disclosure of the infamous audio tape between Sterling and his mistress by the website TMZ. The tape didn\u2019t detail any specific illegal action on Sterling\u2019s part. Sterling didn\u2019t break any laws with his words.</p>\n<p>They were just \u2026 disgusting.</p>\n<p>Yet the NBA and Wachtell, Lipton only needed three days to begin and conclude an investigation, which seemed to have exactly one question at its core:</p>\n<p>\u201cDonald, is this you on the tape?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, it is.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo further questions.\u201d</p>\n<p>This took, again, all of 72 hours, from start to finish.</p>\n<p>Of course, the comments and investigation also came during the first round of the playoffs, which included Sterling\u2019s Clippers, who were playing the Warriors in the first round. And Silver was faced with the likelihood of a league-wide boycott of its three playoff games the night of April 29, by players on all six teams scheduled to play that evening, if he didn\u2019t drop the hammer on Sterling. Which, he did.</p>\n<p>The Kawhi business, of course, will take longer. There is a third party involved \u2014 Aspiration, which went bankrupt earlier this year, and whose co-founder, Joe Sanberg, agreed to plead guilty to one count of wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud in August, amid allegations that Sanberg defrauded Aspiration\u2019s investors, including Ballmer, out of a collective $248 million. This appears to be the crux of Ballmer\u2019s argument: I was duped like everyone else.</p>\n<p>But Torre\u2019s reporting unearthed an unusually united recollection from people in Aspiration\u2019s financial department at the time the deal with Leonard was consummated: many former employees Torre spoke with believed, adamantly, that Leonard\u2019s deal with Aspiration was a) a \u201cno-show\u201d arrangement, in which Leonard wouldn\u2019t have to do any work to get the $28 million Aspiration agreed to pay him over four years, and b) clearly designed to circumvent the NBA\u2019s cap. There are also c), the disclosure that Leonard\u2019s deal with Aspiration would be voided if he left the Clippers, and d) evidence that Robertson, Leonard\u2019s representative, asked for similar workarounds from other teams before Leonard signed with the Clippers in 2021.</p>\n<p>Aspiration\u2019s co-founder, Andrei Cherny, told The Athletic last week via e-mail that Leonard\u2019s job was not a no-show one, though he didn\u2019t provide specifics about Leonard\u2019s job responsibilities or answer why there is no record of anything that Leonard did on behalf of the company. (And, other high-ranking executives in the company recall details about the arrangement with Leonard differently than Cherny does.)</p>\n<p>Again, this will be long and complicated. Aspiration\u2019s former C Suite does not answer to the NBA and does not have to cooperate; the NBA does not have subpoena power. Multiple people at different levels of the company will have to talk. To get the clearest picture possible, Leonard and/or Robertson will have to talk. The Clippers, of course, will have to cooperate: not just Ballmer, but any other executives who had knowledge \u2014 assuming they did \u2014 of Leonard\u2019s arrangement with Aspiration.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen they talk to the NBA,\u201d the longtime NBA exec said of the Clippers\u2019 executives, \u201cthey better come up with a better answer\u201d than Ballmer did in his interview with ESPN last month.</p>\n<p>Yet there is another, equally important principle at stake aside from whether Ballmer and the Clippers violated Article 13.1 of the NBA\u2019s Collective Bargaining Agreement.</p>\n<p>In our current times, objective truth is, far too often, smashed into bits, and is rarely put back together into a coherent whole. Our ecosystem has been poisoned by misinformation, a virus injected into every aspect of our lives. Whatever it is we believe, you can rest assured that there is someone or something \u2014 a reasonably well-paid human, or an unpaid bot \u2014 doing their level best to make you doubt that what you saw or heard is actually what you saw or heard. They do this for their own, selfish reasons; I leave it to you to determine who benefits most from such an arrangement. The assault on truth is designed to destroy our notion of shared, accepted belief.</p>\n<p>Journalism of the type Torre is providing is not designed to prove something beyond a shadow of a doubt. But journalism, good journalism, points you in a clear direction. It says, \u201cHere is what I know now. Tomorrow, I hope to know more.\u201d</p>\n<p>Al Pacino, as \u201c60 Minutes\u201d producer Lowell Bergman in the movie \u201cThe Insider,\u201d put the journalist\u2019s credo into stark relief as he pressed an official for more information: \u201cI\u2019m getting two things: pissed off, and curious.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yes, the NBA\u2019s System Arbitrator will, technically, rule on whether or not the investigation by Wachtell, Lipton proves prima facie circumvention. But it will ultimately be up to Adam Silver to decide Ballmer\u2019s fate. If he determines Ballmer and the Clippers broke the rules, he will have to unleash afterward the resolve he displayed a decade ago, when he threw the book at Sterling based not on broken laws, but righteous anger, and didn\u2019t look back. Because he knew what was true.</p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6634171/2025/09/19/kawhi-leonard-clippers-investigation-adam-silver-nba/\">https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6634171/2025/09/19/kawhi-leonard-clippers-investigation-adam-silver-nba/</a></p>",

From 10-noon ET daily, he continues on ESPN\u2019s \u201cFirst Take\u201d and, after an hour for lunch, it is a sports-talk show from 1-3 p.m. ET on SiriusXM.

Less than a year later, they had seemingly saved the company and were happily posing for photo-ops with Steve Ballmer celebrating the Clippers partnership and large investment. </p>\n<p>The rest of the complaint does reference events and figures more directly related to the NBA story. There is an \"Investor 1\" that is likely Ballmer and some documented correspondence between his chief investment officer and Sanberg that's interesting to read. It also lays out when the company's accounting firm resigned over fraud concerns and concerns the company's CFO had throughout.</p>",

The Commission found that Microsoft had deliberately abused its dominant position by tying Windows Media Player to its operating system and undermining competition in server software.</p>\n<p>At the center of these cases was a clear pattern: Microsoft used its dominance not to compete fairly but to block competitors, extend its monopoly, and extract rents from consumers and developers.</p>\n<p><strong>Internally, Ballmer presided over the now-notorious \u201cstack ranking\u201d system, in which managers were forced to rank employees against each other, ensuring that some were always labeled failures regardless of performance. Vanity Fair reported that this system was described by employees as \u201cthe most destructive process inside of Microsoft.\u201d It encouraged backstabbing, punished collaboration, and destroyed morale.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Yet Ballmer\u2019s reputation in the business press was rarely tarnished. Microsoft\u2019s aggressive tactics and toxic culture were downplayed as part of the \u201crough and tumble\u201d of the tech industry. Instead of being recognized as symptoms of a deeply flawed corporate ethos, they were cast as evidence of toughness, discipline, or even strategic brilliance.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Ballmer\u2019s career is a perfect case in point. Few in the press asked whether Microsoft\u2019s dominance strangled innovation or whether his leadership undermined workers and consumers. Instead, the coverage painted him as a colorful eccentric, a lovable billionaire, and above all a success story\u2014as if his rise were earned brilliance rather than brute monopoly power.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Pablo Torre\u2019s remarkable reporting on the Aspiration scandal is a reminder of what real journalism can do when it asks hard questions instead of recycling corporate talking points. His work not only exposes the hidden machinery of sports business but also shows why we need the same relentless scrutiny of CEOs and executives across industries. If journalism is to serve the public, it must puncture the myths of genius and demand accountability from those who profit most from monopoly and exploitation.</strong></p>\n<p>The NBA investigation may or may not conclude that Ballmer violated the rules. But the larger scandal here is not limited to basketball. It is about how our culture treats men like Ballmer as role models\u2014how we conflate wealth with competence, market share with innovation, and ruthless opportunism with genius.</p>\n<p>The real lesson of this scandal is that we must break the spell of billionaire mythology. Ballmer is not a singular villain; he is an emblem of an age in which billionaires are lauded as saviors while their empires rest on monopoly, exploitation, and illusion. The media has played a crucial role in maintaining this fa\u00e7ade, selling the public a narrative of \u201cgenius\u201d to justify inequality.</p>\n<p>A more honest narrative would recognize that the wealth of men like Ballmer was built on systems of exclusion, not innovation. It would expose the ways that corporate culture, whether in Big Tech or in the world of \u201cethical finance,\u201d uses the language of progress to mask exploitation. And it would challenge the very legitimacy of an economy in which billionaires can fail upward, celebrated as geniuses even as their companies and investments leave wreckage behind.</p>",

According to those sources, who were granted anonymity in order to speak freely about the negotiations, Robertson\u2019s list was long, and absurd. It included a trade for George, which featured an exorbitant price tag. It included a slice of ownership of the Toronto Maple Leafs, which Robertson was told was impossible.</p>\n<p>But two details stand out, in retrospect. One, Robertson asked for ownership stakes in outside companies: not just the Leafs, which he seemed to believe was separate, but with other companies with whom MLSE had a relationship. And two, the Raptors were told they needed to match at least $10 million per year in extra sponsorship income. Teams are allowed to introduce players to team sponsors; teams cannot negotiate deals, and MLSE was aware of that fact.</p>\n<p>But it didn\u2019t end there. As one source put it, when told about all the corporate sponsors in Toronto who would be happy to have Leonard as a pitchman, his camp said, \u201cWe don\u2019t want to do anything.\u201d Raptors representatives said any sponsor would want to shoot ads or arrange appearances; Robertson reiterated Leonard didn\u2019t want to do anything for the money.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s when the Raptors realized Leonard wasn\u2019t asking to be introduced to Toronto\u2019s lucrative corporate community; they were being asked to arrange no-show jobs, and arrange no-investment investments. MLSE rejected both proposals.</p>",

Nevertheless, it's clear where he'll live after his time in the NBA.</p>\n<p>Dirk Nowitzki and Dennis Schr\u00f6der have one thing in common: They both carried the German flag at the Olympic Games. Yet Schr\u00f6der sees a big difference:</p>\n<p>\"I was already sitting in front of the TV at the age of 14 when Dirk Nowitzki carried the flag at the 2008 Summer Games in Beijing. Back then, I thought: How cool, there can't be a greater appreciation,\" said the current captain of the national basketball team in an interview with \"Stern.\" \"Today, however, I know: It's a great honor, but it will never be the same for me as it was for Dirk. I won't receive the same love in this country because I'm dark-skinned.\"</p>\n<p>German expectations</p>\n<p>Germans have certain ideas about how stars should behave. He never fit into that image, especially when he was younger, as he occasionally indulged in expensive watches and luxury cars. \"I've made mistakes, I'm not perfect. Nevertheless, it's wrong to judge someone you don't know well,\" Schr\u00f6der said.</p>\n<p>\"This is a societal problem, and social media only exacerbates this superficiality and hatred,\" said the 31-year-old. \"The fact that I was allowed to be a flag-bearer doesn't make this story any better.\"</p>\n<p>Return to Braunschweig</p>\n<p>Despite these negative experiences, Schr\u00f6der intends to return to his hometown of Braunschweig after his time in the NBA . \"Braunschweig is my home; I'm needed here. That's why I bought the basketball club there, and that's why we're planning academies, camps, and schools for young people there,\" said Schr\u00f6der. \"Many professionals stay in the US after their playing careers and enjoy their fame. But I belong in Germany.\"</p>\n<p>First up for Schr\u00f6der, however, is the European Championship in Finland and Latvia, which begins on August 27th, and then the next NBA season with his new club, the Sacramento Kings. The point guard has clear expectations for the European Championship. \"We will win the title. If I wasn't convinced of that, I wouldn't play in the tournament and would rather spend my time in Braunschweig.\"</p>\n<p>Source: https://www.stern.de/gesellschaft/regional/niedersachsen-bremen/vor-der-basketball-em--schroeder--werde-nie-gleiche-liebe-wie-nowitzki-bekommen-35986550.html</p>",

            "content_html": "<blockquote>\n<p>Bodybuilder Patrick Graber sent a letter via FedEx to Los Angeles Lakers guard Kobe Bryant in 2003 offering to k**l the woman who accused Bryant of sexual assault if he paid Graber $3,000,000. </p>\n<p>TMZ Sports reported that the FBI released a heavily-redacted 17-page document earlier this month detailing the case. They also noted that Bryant's team immediately contacted authorities after receiving the letter.</p>\n<p>Per\u00a0Scott Schwebke\u00a0of the\u00a0Orange County Register, an undercover Los Angeles County detective spoke twice with Graber, who admitted to the murder-for-hire scheme and said he would \"execute Bryant\u2019s accuser leaving no evidence.\"</p>\n<p>In the meantime, officials also traveled to the woman's residence in Colorado to make her aware of the threat.</p>\n<p>Los Angeles County sheriff\u2019s deputies and FBI agents arrested Graber on Sept. 18, 2003 as part of a setup to collect the first $1 million, according to Schwebke.</p>\n<p>The bodybuilder reached into a car for a bag of\u00a0movie studio prop money before 30 officers surrounded him in an El Segundo, California supermarket parking lot and arrested him.</p>\n<p>The Swiss national, who was 31 years old when he sent the letter,\u00a0pleaded no contest to grand theft in 2004, per Schwebke. Prosecutors dropped other charges, including solicitation to commit murder.</p>\n<p>Graber was sentenced to three years in prison, and he was ordered to be deported upon his release.</p>\n<p>Bryant was arrested\u00a0in 2003 after a 19-year-old woman said he raped her at the Vail, Colorado, hotel where the Lakers star was staying prior to a scheduled knee surgery. He said the sexual encounter with the woman, who worked at the hotel, was consensual.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The criminal case was dropped after the woman decided not to testify. She and Bryant later settled out of court in a civil suit she filed against him.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10012061-patrick-graber-allegedly-offered-to-kill-kobe-bryants-rape-accuser-for-3m-in-2003\">Article</a></p>",
