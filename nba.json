            "content_html": "<p>How big of a problem is the Clippers controversy for the NBA?</p>\n<p>If you ask Pablo Torre, who first broke the story of Kawhi Leonard\u2019s $28 million \u201cno-show\u201d endorsement deal with green-banking company Aspiration about a month ago on his podcast Pablo Torre Finds Out, it\u2019s \u201cthe defining scandal of Adam Silver\u2019s tenure as commissioner.\u201d </p>\n<p>If you ask Mark Cuban, it\u2019s no problem at all. \u201cI don\u2019t think the Clippers did anything wrong,\u201d he told Front Office Sports on Thursday over email. \u201cSo zero problem.\u201d </p>\n<p>Torre has certainly uncovered compelling evidence that raises many questions. Why did Clippers owner Steve Ballmer continue putting money in Aspiration\u2014and also in the personal charity of cofounder Joe Sanberg\u2014even after news broke that Aspiration was under investigation by the feds? Why did his Clippers co-owner Dennis Wong invest in it, too? In what world is a $28 million player endorsement deal involving no ads or appearances normal? </p>\n<p>The NBA has initiated an investigation to attempt to answer these questions. Such investigations take months, not weeks, and the league knows the public\u2019s attention span is short. Here\u2019s an easy prediction: This one won\u2019t end with the NBA making Ballmer sell the team like the Donald Sterling investigation did. Depending on what the league finds, it could yield anything from a major to a minor punishment to nothing at all. The NBA could conclude it buys Ballmer\u2019s thin explanation that Aspiration \u201cconned me.\u201d</p>\n<p>I\u2019m more interested in how a little-known carbon-credits fintech company secured a $300 million deal as an official \u201cfounding sponsor\u201d of an NBA team\u2014a price and designation that required NBA approval.</p>\n<p>The situation reminds me very much of FTX, the fraudulent crypto exchange that launched in 2019, surged to a $32 billion valuation by early 2022, and collapsed by the end of that same year. Along the way, FTX cozied up to Tom Brady and Gisele B\u00fcndchen, plus a slew of athlete endorsers. (Aspiration had Drake and Leo DiCaprio.) In March 2021, FTX entered a 19-year, $135 million stadium naming rights deal with the Miami Heat. </p>\n<p>Why did the Heat, NBA, and city of Miami trust that a company that had existed for less than two years would be around for 19 years? In an interview with FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried\u2014now serving a 25-year sentence in a California prison\u2014in May 2021, I asked him that. He smiled and said, \u201cIt\u2019s been a pretty good year for us. To the point where, frankly, we don\u2019t need to rely on the other 18 years to have the funds for this.\u201d By January 2023, the company was dead and its logo stripped from the Heat arena.</p>\n<p>I asked Silver about the league\u2019s approval process for team sponsors onstage at our Tuned In summit in New York on Sept. 16. \u201cThis was not something that was on our radar to even be thinking about,\u201d he responded. \u201cWhen this concludes, we\u2019ll take a fresh look at our rules in terms of companies that players are investing in, and owners.\u201d</p>\n<p>But then he argued that the NBA can\u2019t fully look into every team sponsor. </p>\n<p>\u201cThere are literally thousands of deals that cover all our teams,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd these are brands that have major investors, major funds\u2014that was certainly clear of the crypto world at the time. And so, yes, there\u2019s a league approval process, but it doesn\u2019t go deep into interviewing executives for every deal that comes through the league office.\u201d</p>\n<p>And in response to my mention of FTX, Silver appeared to suggest that because crypto prices are up right now, little-known crypto companies look less shady.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s go back to those [crypto] deals,\u201d he said. \u201cNow crypto\u2019s back up. We have deals with some of the crypto companies now, and now the market is killing, going crazy on crypto. So is there a different view now? I\u2019m just saying, we live in a market economy, there is a government that regulates these industries, there are teams and team owners that are risking their reputations and brands.\u201d </p>\n<p>I am certainly not suggesting the NBA needs to interview executives from every team sponsor to ensure they\u2019re honest and aboveboard. That would not be realistic. But clearly it should more closely scrutinize sponsors at the $300 million level. Because you have to wonder how many more Aspirations there are across the NBA\u2014and other leagues, too.</p>\n<p>Source:\u00a0https://frontofficesports.com/clippers-aspiration-fiasco-recalls-another-doomed-nba-sponsorship/</p>",

The auditory hallucinations, diagnosed in 2021 as schizophrenia, turned the big-hearted, caring side of his personality his family loved into a hypervigilant, protective paranoia that his parents, Elisabeth and Jeffrey, tried to de-escalate. As a last resort, they would call in Marta, a licensed therapist, and Duncan, who was Eli's \"whisperer.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<blockquote>\n<p>The voices were \"all about us being in danger,\" Marta said.</p>\n<p>Duncan said: \"The real challenge of that was the volatility. He would call me, he would make sure I was safe. He made sure I was OK. ... And then he could hang up. And sure enough, maybe, you know, 15 to 20 minutes later, he called me again.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo of course, in that stretch, I think, probably the greatest challenge was finding ways to compartmentalize and still try to perform. I always kept in perspective, like he\u2019s the one going through it. And obviously it impacts us as a family. We were all sort of constantly anxious and on edge, but that was never the priority, making sure we were OK. It was always making sure he was OK.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"It was this weird juxtaposition that I was sort of living my dream, really our dream, because it\u2019s what my brother wanted, too,\" he said. \"And then going 35 miles up the road and seeing this totally different experience of what my own flesh and blood, you know, my big brother was going through.</p>\n<p>\"Those are really some of the most challenging aspects in years for me, because he was so close. But in reality, it felt like he was so far. I would try to always have these points of contact, but it was really hard.\"</p>\n</blockquote><div><br></div><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0px; position: relative; padding-bottom: 177.778%;\"><iframe class=\"streamable-embed\" src=\"https://streamable.com/o/wii4b1\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>",

He wanted unlimited access to a private plane, a house and guaranteed off-court earnings from endorsements, The Athletic previously reported. He also wanted a slice of the team itself \u2014 just like the Lakers had given Magic Johnson 25 years earlier after HIV forced him into early retirement.</strong></p>\n<p>The asks \u2014 all considered circumvention of the salary cap in the eyes of the NBA \u2014 were turned down by the team.</p>\n<p>But Robertson asked for them again. And again. And again.</p>\n<p><strong>The Lakers repeatedly told Robertson that his requests were against the NBA\u2019s collective bargaining agreement. Outside of the negotiations, team sources said, the Lakers laughed at Robertson\u2019s audacity. And to Robertson himself, team president Jeanie Buss underscored the outrageousness of the requests by saying he should attempt to get other teams to agree to his terms in writing.</strong></p>\n<p>Leonard ultimately chose to sign with the LA Clippers in 2019, the team meeting a different demand by trading for co-star Paul George. Those 2019 negotiations led to an investigation by the NBA, which concluded there was no evidence that the Clippers granted any of Robertson\u2019s improper requests.</p>\n<p>Now, the dealings by Robertson and Leonard have surfaced again as the superstar forward, the Clippers and team owner Steve Ballmer face an investigation about whether the Clippers ran afoul of the league\u2019s salary cap rules. The investigation stems from a previously unannounced endorsement deal with Aspiration, a company with close business ties to the Clippers and Ballmer, that could have netted Leonard close to $50 million, as first reported by Pablo Torre on his \u201cPablo Torre Finds Out\u201d podcast earlier this month.</p>",

They get a lot of slack and they don't get enough credit for their ability to execute in those tight environments. But these wine laws. A lot of them are from so long ago and some of them should be changed. We're in a different time now.</p>\n<p>You\u2019ve joined the board of Oregon LIVE Certified. Why was that important to you?</p>\n<p>Sustainability has always been important to my family, not just on the wine side but because we care about the environment. We want this place to be better than it is now. And better than it was when we found it after we leave. We care about the future of our society and especially, with having kids, we want them to be able to live in a safe, healthy environment.</p>\n<p>We also want to make sure that the employees and people that are on the farms are paid well and treated well. Obviously lately there's been a situation where a lot of the farm workers who are not from the United States are in difficult positions. People who have been in the United States for 10 years, even 30 years, and are either being detained on farms or being detained outside of courthouses. Some people have even had court cases scheduled, then the court case gets dismissed and they're arrested.</p>\n<p>How vital is this workforce to the wine industry?</p>\n<p>Immigrants are vital to not only wine, but so many different parts of society. I think people are starting to realize that. But for those of us in the wine business, understanding the importance of harvest and farming land and how many people play a vital role in that \u2014 the business won't survive without immigrants.</p>\n<p>Who have been some of your favorite NBA colleagues to share wine with?</p>\n<p>I'm from Ohio, so I've obviously drank wine with LeBron. Kevin Love has a great palate. He drinks a variety of wine. Channing Frye. Carmelo Anthony always brings some unique wines and he\u2019s heavy on white burgundy. Terry Stotts has a good palate. Coach Willie Green enjoys his wine. I've shared some different Pinots with him. It\u2019s cool to drink with players, but I would say I enjoy drinking wine with my wife the most. We've got special occasion bottles. Birthday and celebratory bottles. Birth year bottles. We enjoy opening a bottle and sharing stories. We've had some unique experiences over the course of our life.</p>\n<p>Would you be happy if one day someone knew nothing about your sports career and said \u2018you're the guy that makes that wine?\u2019</p>\n<p>That would be cool. That\u2019s something that takes time. Maybe 15 years from now someone will say \u2018he played basketball? I thought he was the guy from that winery.\u2019 That would be a great moment. One day I\u2019ll just be Jacobi and Margaux\u2019s dad and the guy who makes wine.

            "content_html": "<p>Everyone around the league will be watching to see if the investigation by the firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz, which led the league\u2019s investigation into the Sterling tape, will, if cap circumvention is proven, lead to severe sanctions against the NBA\u2019s richest owner.</p>\n<p>You may recall when the league suspended former Suns governor Robert Sarver for a year and fined him $10 million in 2022, after a 10-month investigation by Wachtell, Lipton into allegations of a toxic work environment for women and minorities in the Suns\u2019 organization, LeBron James and Chris Paul expressed disappointment with the NBA\u2019s discipline.

Of course, the Clippers have denied they\u2019ve done anything wrong. Of course, the burden of proof is on the league to prove malfeasance up near Playa Vista, Calif., where the Clippers were headquartered in 2021, when all this began.</p>\n<p>Smoking guns tend to be hard to find, though Torre\u2019s dogged work over the last several months has unearthed quite the road map toward one.</p>\n<p>If the NBA finds the Clippers guilty, it can\u2019t do what it did in 2018 to the Mavericks, after a seven-month investigation that was initiated by the team, with league oversight, corroborated the findings of a Sports Illustrated story detailing a toxic work environment for women throughout the organization. The Mavs\u2019 \u201cpunishment,\u201d such as it was, was what the league obliquely called a $10 million \u201cdonation\u201d that Cuban would make toward organizations \u201ccommitted to supporting the leadership and development of women in the sports industry and combating domestic violence.\u201d</p>\n<p>Which was noble, and helpful, but did not include the word \u201cfine\u201d anywhere.</p>\n<p>There was no such equivocating when Silver threw Sterling out of the league in 2014, after the disclosure of the infamous audio tape between Sterling and his mistress by the website TMZ. The tape didn\u2019t detail any specific illegal action on Sterling\u2019s part. Sterling didn\u2019t break any laws with his words.</p>\n<p>They were just \u2026 disgusting.</p>\n<p>Yet the NBA and Wachtell, Lipton only needed three days to begin and conclude an investigation, which seemed to have exactly one question at its core:</p>\n<p>\u201cDonald, is this you on the tape?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, it is.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo further questions.\u201d</p>\n<p>This took, again, all of 72 hours, from start to finish.</p>\n<p>Of course, the comments and investigation also came during the first round of the playoffs, which included Sterling\u2019s Clippers, who were playing the Warriors in the first round. And Silver was faced with the likelihood of a league-wide boycott of its three playoff games the night of April 29, by players on all six teams scheduled to play that evening, if he didn\u2019t drop the hammer on Sterling. Which, he did.</p>\n<p>The Kawhi business, of course, will take longer. There is a third party involved \u2014 Aspiration, which went bankrupt earlier this year, and whose co-founder, Joe Sanberg, agreed to plead guilty to one count of wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud in August, amid allegations that Sanberg defrauded Aspiration\u2019s investors, including Ballmer, out of a collective $248 million. This appears to be the crux of Ballmer\u2019s argument: I was duped like everyone else.</p>\n<p>But Torre\u2019s reporting unearthed an unusually united recollection from people in Aspiration\u2019s financial department at the time the deal with Leonard was consummated: many former employees Torre spoke with believed, adamantly, that Leonard\u2019s deal with Aspiration was a) a \u201cno-show\u201d arrangement, in which Leonard wouldn\u2019t have to do any work to get the $28 million Aspiration agreed to pay him over four years, and b) clearly designed to circumvent the NBA\u2019s cap. There are also c), the disclosure that Leonard\u2019s deal with Aspiration would be voided if he left the Clippers, and d) evidence that Robertson, Leonard\u2019s representative, asked for similar workarounds from other teams before Leonard signed with the Clippers in 2021.</p>\n<p>Aspiration\u2019s co-founder, Andrei Cherny, told The Athletic last week via e-mail that Leonard\u2019s job was not a no-show one, though he didn\u2019t provide specifics about Leonard\u2019s job responsibilities or answer why there is no record of anything that Leonard did on behalf of the company. (And, other high-ranking executives in the company recall details about the arrangement with Leonard differently than Cherny does.)</p>\n<p>Again, this will be long and complicated. Aspiration\u2019s former C Suite does not answer to the NBA and does not have to cooperate; the NBA does not have subpoena power. Multiple people at different levels of the company will have to talk. To get the clearest picture possible, Leonard and/or Robertson will have to talk. The Clippers, of course, will have to cooperate: not just Ballmer, but any other executives who had knowledge \u2014 assuming they did \u2014 of Leonard\u2019s arrangement with Aspiration.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen they talk to the NBA,\u201d the longtime NBA exec said of the Clippers\u2019 executives, \u201cthey better come up with a better answer\u201d than Ballmer did in his interview with ESPN last month.</p>\n<p>Yet there is another, equally important principle at stake aside from whether Ballmer and the Clippers violated Article 13.1 of the NBA\u2019s Collective Bargaining Agreement.</p>\n<p>In our current times, objective truth is, far too often, smashed into bits, and is rarely put back together into a coherent whole. Our ecosystem has been poisoned by misinformation, a virus injected into every aspect of our lives. Whatever it is we believe, you can rest assured that there is someone or something \u2014 a reasonably well-paid human, or an unpaid bot \u2014 doing their level best to make you doubt that what you saw or heard is actually what you saw or heard. They do this for their own, selfish reasons; I leave it to you to determine who benefits most from such an arrangement. The assault on truth is designed to destroy our notion of shared, accepted belief.</p>\n<p>Journalism of the type Torre is providing is not designed to prove something beyond a shadow of a doubt. But journalism, good journalism, points you in a clear direction. It says, \u201cHere is what I know now. Tomorrow, I hope to know more.\u201d</p>\n<p>Al Pacino, as \u201c60 Minutes\u201d producer Lowell Bergman in the movie \u201cThe Insider,\u201d put the journalist\u2019s credo into stark relief as he pressed an official for more information: \u201cI\u2019m getting two things: pissed off, and curious.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yes, the NBA\u2019s System Arbitrator will, technically, rule on whether or not the investigation by Wachtell, Lipton proves prima facie circumvention. But it will ultimately be up to Adam Silver to decide Ballmer\u2019s fate. If he determines Ballmer and the Clippers broke the rules, he will have to unleash afterward the resolve he displayed a decade ago, when he threw the book at Sterling based not on broken laws, but righteous anger, and didn\u2019t look back. Because he knew what was true.</p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6634171/2025/09/19/kawhi-leonard-clippers-investigation-adam-silver-nba/\">https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6634171/2025/09/19/kawhi-leonard-clippers-investigation-adam-silver-nba/</a></p>",

Less than a year later, they had seemingly saved the company and were happily posing for photo-ops with Steve Ballmer celebrating the Clippers partnership and large investment. </p>\n<p>The rest of the complaint does reference events and figures more directly related to the NBA story. There is an \"Investor 1\" that is likely Ballmer and some documented correspondence between his chief investment officer and Sanberg that's interesting to read. It also lays out when the company's accounting firm resigned over fraud concerns and concerns the company's CFO had throughout.</p>",

Days later, according to reporting by \u201cPablo Torre Finds Out,\u201d Aspiration paid Leonard $1.75 million.</p>\n<p>Three months later, according to court documents in a civil suit, Ballmer invested $9,999,997.92 in the company. Aspiration had been struggling financially, with just $12.2 million in cash as of Feb. 17, 2023 and running through more than $2 million a week. The Clippers declined to comment on the March 2023 investment. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s unclear if Aspiration continued paying Leonard, who is listed as a creditor in Aspiration\u2019s bankruptcy filings for $7 million, as are two companies representing the Clippers for a combined $50 million.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6624269/2025/09/12/clippers-steve-ballmer-kawhi-leonard-aspiration-investment-sponsorship/</p>",
