KD argues these fans don\u2019t really know what they\u2019re talking about. Here is the full argument, for those that don\u2019t have Twitter: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Twitter user</strong>: Please @NBA adopt more @FIBA rules and let us see the best really think the game and play the game like it's meant to be played</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>KD</strong>: I swear yall just be yappin. What rules u wanna see man?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Twitter user</strong>: I want to see the 3 seconds back and that's it.... you disagree?  More movement less ISO / Quicker Decisions - keep 3s the same as NBA - Can't knock off the rim (that's dumb)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>KD</strong>: If u want to eliminate defensive 3 seconds then the games will be slower.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Twitter user</strong>: I don't disagree with that (i'm 40 so i'm late 90s basketball lo)  ... but more schemes &amp; quicker decisions offensively not as much holding \nNBA is fine man lol it's the best product in the world with the best players PERIOD - would love to see it ... i'm watching yall do it now</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>KD</strong>: The beauty of basketball is not callin all them sets but playing off instincts and lettin the talent dictate the game..gettin out in transition, driving and kicking, playing random basketball. U want a trick play every possession like it\u2019s football. That\u2019s not why our game is beautiful</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Twitter user</strong>: That works when your team is stacked 1-5. It does \u2018t work when you need to get the best out of every player on the floor in different aspects (screens, passes, cuts) when your team has guys all playing roles, you need play calling.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>KD</strong>: Random basketball!! U not comprehending what I\u2019m saying. U can RANDOMLY set a screen, RANDOMLY back cut, RANDOMLY make a pass to the open man. Focus on what I\u2019m saying </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So do you guys agree with KD that FIBA rules wouldn\u2019t make NBA basketball \u201cmore beautiful\u201d? </p>",

I didn\u2019t know [the timeline]. I saw it on Twitter and I was like woah, where did this come from? Because I mean from the conversation that I had with the U.S. was, \"Take as much time as you need. There\u2019s no rush. We\u2019d love to have you but it\u2019s okay if you make another decision.\" And when you got someone else putting the pressure on you, making it seem like, \u2018Oh, you gotta make the decision.\u2019\u00a0</p>\n<p>But then again, one thing that was always known was that Cameroon is the first choice. And if they qualify, I\u2019m playing for my home country because that\u2019s my dream to play in the Olympics. And I had the opportunity to talk to the French president about what was going on. And I told him, I mean, one thing that was kind of bothering me a lot was the relationship between France and Cameroon and African countries in general, historically and even right now. There\u2019s a lot of things going on over there where there\u2019s a lot of push back as far as basically kicking out the French because it\u2019s been so many years of oppression. So that was my mindset because I just knew it would be hard. I still got my family living in Cameroon and I don\u2019t want to put them through any of that stuff. I want them to be safe. And the relationship between France and Cameroon in general is not good. </p>\n</blockquote>",

I couldn\u2019t believe the look the guy gave <strong>Michael: \u2018See MJ, we take care of you.\u2019</strong> No wonder in the nine full seasons we played together, he averaged more steals than me in every year except two.\u201d</p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://hoopswire.com/nba-scorekeeper-gave-stats-michael-jordan-bulls-news-rumors/\">https://hoopswire.com/nba-scorekeeper-gave-stats-michael-jordan-bulls-news-rumors/</a></p>\n<p>Two legends of the game, working in the same building for over a decade, Jordan and Rosenberg shared a strong kinship<strong>. On the side, Rosenberg made scrapbooks for Jordan to commemorate his achievements</strong>. In the opening lines of MJ\u2019s 1999 retirement column, Chicago AP writer Jim Litke didn\u2019t mention Phil Jackson or Scottie Pippen. Instead, he raised Rosenberg\u2019s name and relayed a story about Jordan\u2019s shared obsession with stats:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cThe first week Jordan played for the Bulls, scorer Bob Rosenberg looked up to find him studying the scorebook every time he reported to the table to re-enter the game. It didn\u2019t take long to figure out why. By knowing everybody\u2019s point and rebound totals, Jordan knew how the newspaper stories the next day would begin. Then he took the floor and made sure they always began the same way: \u2018Michael Jordan \u2026\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI write down everything,\u201d reports Rosenberg. \u201cI have books that list every sporting event I\u2019ve worked or gone to, the statistics, the results, what happened so I can look back knowing I was there. I like having a record. I also get a program from every game I go to and work. I get the newspaper clippings from the next day <strong>(Rosenberg kept at Michael Jordan\u2019s request a scrap book of stories from every game Jordan played for the Bulls and says Michael rewarded him well)</strong>;\u00a0</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>The Rosenberg and Jordan dynamic was written about in the press, and reportedly at one point drew scrutiny from the league office</strong>. According to a 1989 report from the San Francisco Examiner, Rosenberg would flash hand signals to inform Jordan how close he was to a triple-double. The league reportedly stepped in and told Rosenberg to cut it out.</p>\n<p>Rosenberg admitted to signaling to help Jordan chase stats during Chicago\u2019s 1988 All-Star Game, a game in which Jordan scored a game-high 40 points, just shy of matching Chamberlain\u2019s then-record of 42. As the site\u2019s official scorekeeper, Rosenberg worked the game and remembered a postgame exchange he had with Jordan. In 2013, Rosenberg shared the following anecdote with the Chicago Tribune:</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me I was two points short of Chamberlain?\u201d Rosenberg recalled Jordan asking him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI said, \u2018Look, every time you went by, I kept putting up two fingers. You didn\u2019t understand that?\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/a-closer-look-at-michael-jordans-1988-dpoy-award-raises-questions-about-its-validity-has-lebron-james-been-chasing-a-ghost-140452567.html\">https://sports.yahoo.com/a-closer-look-at-michael-jordans-1988-dpoy-award-raises-questions-about-its-validity-has-lebron-james-been-chasing-a-ghost-140452567.html</a></p>",

With drug addiction being a major factor, he became homeless shortly after he was one of basketball\u2019s most talented players.</p>\n<p>Here are some other Marvin Barnes stories and anecdotes, originally from the book Loose Balls:</p>\n<p>In his youth, Barnes was part of a gang that attempted to rob a bus. Barnes was quickly identified, as he was wearing his state championship jacket with his name embroidered on it.</p>\n<p>Marvin just figured that everybody would take care of him. \u201cEverybody loves News,\u201d which was what he called himself. Time meant nothing to him. Rules meant nothing. Money meant nothing. For being late, they started fining him $1 a minute, then $5, then $10. I think it got up to $50 a minute, but he didn\u2019t care. They\u2019d take the money out of his paycheck, but he knew that he\u2019d usually get it back.</p>\n<p>So much of what Marvin did was counterproductive to his career. He disdained practice. He stayed up all night. He didn\u2019t listen to anyone about anything, but then he\u2019d come out and play a great game. You\u2019d see that and know that the gods had touched this man and made him a great player, only he had no idea what he had.</p>\n<p>Marvin would walk into a game 20 minutes before it was time to start. People would be taped and ready to go out for warmups, and Marvin would stroll into the dressing room with all this food\u2014 steak and gravy, black-eyed peas, greens, mashed potatoes. He would be eating it while someone taped his ankles, then he\u2019d tell the ballboy, \u201cI got some women coming in tonight. I need five tickets\u2014and get me some body lotion, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m a basketball player, not a monk. I play the women, I play the clothes, I play the cars, I play everything I can play. There\u2019s players and there\u2019s playees. The playees are the ones who get played on by the players. I\u2019m a player.\u201d Barnes also said, \u201cI\u2019m 22 and a 22-year-old kid ain\u2019t no genius.\u201d And he said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to act like an old man of 30 when I\u2019m 22. But they keep telling me, \u2019You can\u2019t make any more mistakes, Marvin. Don\u2019t miss any more planes. Be on time, Marvin. Drink your milk, Marvin. Eat your vegetables, Marvin.\u2019 I\u2019m tired of being \u2019the franchise,\u2019 and all those responsibilities.\u201d</p>\n<p>Marvin had a great night, 48 points. After the game, I saw him in the dressing room and he started giving me his State of the Spirits speech. He told me, \u201cBro, you know what\u2019s wrong with this team? We don\u2019t have any team play. We don\u2019t care about each other.\u201d</p>\n<p>I thought, \u201cMaybe Marvin is starting to see what the problem is\u2014this team has no unity.\u201d\nThen Marvin continued, \u201cLet me give you an example. Tonight, I had 48 points with two minutes to go. Did anybody pass me the ball so I could get 50? Huh? No, they just kept the ball to themselves and I got stuck at 48. Stuff like that; that\u2019s what\u2019s wrong with these guys.\u201d</p>\n<p>TLDR: Marvin Barnes was awesome</p>",
