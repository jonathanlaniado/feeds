KD argues these fans don\u2019t really know what they\u2019re talking about. Here is the full argument, for those that don\u2019t have Twitter: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Twitter user</strong>: Please @NBA adopt more @FIBA rules and let us see the best really think the game and play the game like it's meant to be played</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>KD</strong>: I swear yall just be yappin. What rules u wanna see man?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Twitter user</strong>: I want to see the 3 seconds back and that's it.... you disagree?  More movement less ISO / Quicker Decisions - keep 3s the same as NBA - Can't knock off the rim (that's dumb)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>KD</strong>: If u want to eliminate defensive 3 seconds then the games will be slower.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Twitter user</strong>: I don't disagree with that (i'm 40 so i'm late 90s basketball lo)  ... but more schemes &amp; quicker decisions offensively not as much holding \nNBA is fine man lol it's the best product in the world with the best players PERIOD - would love to see it ... i'm watching yall do it now</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>KD</strong>: The beauty of basketball is not callin all them sets but playing off instincts and lettin the talent dictate the game..gettin out in transition, driving and kicking, playing random basketball. U want a trick play every possession like it\u2019s football. That\u2019s not why our game is beautiful</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Twitter user</strong>: That works when your team is stacked 1-5. It does \u2018t work when you need to get the best out of every player on the floor in different aspects (screens, passes, cuts) when your team has guys all playing roles, you need play calling.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>KD</strong>: Random basketball!! U not comprehending what I\u2019m saying. U can RANDOMLY set a screen, RANDOMLY back cut, RANDOMLY make a pass to the open man. Focus on what I\u2019m saying </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So do you guys agree with KD that FIBA rules wouldn\u2019t make NBA basketball \u201cmore beautiful\u201d? </p>",

I didn\u2019t know [the timeline]. I saw it on Twitter and I was like woah, where did this come from? Because I mean from the conversation that I had with the U.S. was, \"Take as much time as you need. There\u2019s no rush. We\u2019d love to have you but it\u2019s okay if you make another decision.\" And when you got someone else putting the pressure on you, making it seem like, \u2018Oh, you gotta make the decision.\u2019\u00a0</p>\n<p>But then again, one thing that was always known was that Cameroon is the first choice. And if they qualify, I\u2019m playing for my home country because that\u2019s my dream to play in the Olympics. And I had the opportunity to talk to the French president about what was going on. And I told him, I mean, one thing that was kind of bothering me a lot was the relationship between France and Cameroon and African countries in general, historically and even right now. There\u2019s a lot of things going on over there where there\u2019s a lot of push back as far as basically kicking out the French because it\u2019s been so many years of oppression. So that was my mindset because I just knew it would be hard. I still got my family living in Cameroon and I don\u2019t want to put them through any of that stuff. I want them to be safe. And the relationship between France and Cameroon in general is not good. </p>\n</blockquote>",
