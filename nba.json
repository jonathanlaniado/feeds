In his first month, he was given a mandate from owner Robert Sarver: Shed enough salary to escape the luxury tax.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe were, like, exactly eight million over the tax,\u201d Kerr recalled recently to The Athletic. \u201cJust trading Kurt Thomas got us under the tax. And there was only one team, literally one team in the entire league, that could absorb his salary into a slot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSam knew exactly what he was doing,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cI knew how smart he was and how well-prepared for the job he was just from being with (Gregg Popovich) and R.C. (Buford) and learning the ropes from them. I was a young GM. I\u2019m put in this position that I have to make this deal. Business is business. We ended up giving up two unprotected firsts.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kerr traded Phoenix\u2019s 2008 and 2010 first-round picks along with Thomas\u2019 contract. The Suns finished that next season 55-27, delivering Presti and the Thunder not a premium asset, but a valuable tool if utilized correctly.</p>\n<p>Presti used the 24th pick on Serge Ibaka, a young power forward flashing some upside in Europe. </p>\n<p>After Ibaka\u2019s seventh season, on draft night of 2016, Presti sent him to the Magic for Victor Oladipo and the 11th pick. He\u2019d immediately use that draft pick on Domantas Sabonis, bringing in a young starting shooting guard and what appeared to be Ibaka\u2019s long-term replacement at power forward.</p>\n<p>Presti pulled the trigger on a trade the following summer (2017) for Paul George, the replacement co-star next to Westbrook. To acquire George, he sent Oladipo and Sabonis to the Indiana Pacers, the exact package he received for Ibaka.</p>\n<p>Presti traded George to the LA Clippers for a package that included Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and a war chest of draft assets. One of those picks, the No. 12 pick in 2022, was used on Jalen Williams.</p>\n</blockquote>",

That evening, the Indiana Pacers were facing the New York Knicks in Game 2 of the NBA\u2019s Eastern Conference Finals, a game that the Pacers won 114-109 at Madison Square Garden in New York City.</p>\n<p>Initially, police were called because of an alleged fight involving a man, later identified as Jarrett Funke. However, once Funke left the brewery, the caller stated that police did not need to respond.</p>\n<p>Minutes later, an employee of the brewery called police, stating that Funke had reportedly returned to the brewery\u2019s patio. The caller stated that Funke reportedly stabbed a man in the back and was attempting to leave.</p>\n<p>When police arrived, they found two individuals with wounds. The court documents said that one had a stab wound in the back while the other had a laceration in his lower leg.</p>\n<p>In interviews with the two victims, they alleged that Funke approached them at the bar. Funke reportedly \u201csmacked\u201d the Knicks hat off of one of the victims onto the ground. Funke was then reportedly taken outside as he yelled \u201cf\u2014 you, you still have a f\u2014\u2014 problem. Take this outside.\u201d to the two individuals.</p>\n<p>Around five minutes later, the two Knicks fans were outside on the patio when Funke reportedly \u201cstormed through the fence\u201d of the brewery and began attacking the two individuals. One of the victims told police that he \u201cbriefly displayed a black folding pocket knife to deter (Funke) but repocketed it, as he had no intention of using it.\u201d</p>\n<p>A verbal altercation reportedly evolved into a physical one, ending with the two victims being allegedly stabbed by Funke. In an interview with Funke, he reportedly told police that the two Knicks fans were \u201ctalking s\u2014\u201d and claimed that they were the ones who began the altercation.</p>\n<p>Funke claims that one of the Knicks fans pushed him to the ground and \u201cbegan punching him in the face.\u201d The documents said that Funke claims that he \u201cretrieved his pocketknife from his hoodie and swung it around towards (one of the Knicks fans) back with his right hand.\u201d</p>\n<p>However, the documents said that there were multiple witnesses who stated that Funke was the \u201cprimary aggressor in this incident.\u201d</p>\n<p>According to court documents, Funke\u2019s initial hearing is scheduled for Tuesday afternoon in Hamilton County.</p>\n<p>As of this story\u2019s publication, the Indiana Pacers lead the NBA Eastern Conference Finals against the New York Knicks 2-1, with Game 4 scheduled for 8 p.m. on Tuesday at Gainbridge Fieldhouse in downtown Indianapolis.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I can see why - any time someone slightly dips into a high voice, or dresses different,  they are ostracized. I have seen multiple clips of NYC street interviews, 'give us your best KAT impression,\" they're doing the same gay voice that was a played joke 10 years ago when I was in high school. You can hear the hate dripping from it. Just got a clip of Lonzo Ball getting interviewed by Cameron Brink - egging him on to make fun of KAT and he won't and Brink just starts doing the voice. What the hell is wrong with people? Do they just not understand how fucking rude they seem? it's funny to see clips of Kat, whatever, but the entire media apparatus is borderline bullying bro right now for something he doesn't even publicly identify as. It's disgusting.</p>\n<p>edit: all the replies too scared to say some real choice words and catch a reddit ban. we used to have a word for \"zesty\" online in the 2010s too, and it wasn't necessarily coming from a place of bigotry - we just used it to keep other guys in check about what was acceptable behavior. same thing happening here, just being typed by way softer hands who can't stand behind what they're actually making fun of.</p>",
