It was never like we went to one of our ATMs, took out a player, used him until he was most useful, and then threw him away.\u201d</p>\n<p>While Nowitzki was celebrated with a farewell tour and ultimately had a statue erected outside American Airlines Center, Don\u010di\u0107 \u2014 who became the face of the franchise and an international superstar under Nelson\u2019s leadership \u2014 was traded at age 25 in the prime of his career.</p>\n<p><strong>\u201cOf course, this is the NBA, and trades can happen; players come and go,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cBut with all due respect, you have to understand that some players are different, special, and even more important to the environment and the community. It\u2019s important to treat those players with respect.\u201d</strong></p>\n<p>Nelson didn\u2019t directly criticize the front office but clarified that Don\u010di\u0107\u2019s exit didn\u2019t reflect the values that had defined the Mavericks during his tenure.</p>\n<p><strong>\u201cThat\u2019s why there was so much disappointment after what happened to Luka,\u201d he said. \u201cNot just my disappointment, but a universal disappointment. Could this happen to Real [Madrid]? Never. And it wouldn\u2019t have happened when I was in Dallas.\u201d</strong></p>\n<p>Nelson served as the Mavericks\u2019 general manager and president of basketball operations during Nowitzki\u2019s entire career and was the driving force behind the trade that brought Don\u010di\u0107 to Dallas in 2018. He parted ways with the organization in 2021 but has publicly supported both players.</p>\n<p>Don\u010di\u0107 is now focused on the Lakers for the next chapter of his career. At the same time, Nelson has re-entered the international basketball world as a strategic advisor for the Slovenian national team ahead of EuroBasket 2025.</p>\n<p>\u201cThese things \u2014 the relationships, the values \u2014 they last forever,\u201d Nelson said.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>Source: https://intheno.substack.com/p/queens-gambit-inside-the-pelicans</p>\n<p>Interesting article on the disastrous Pelicans Front Office:</p>\n<p>From that moment on, text after text rolled in from league execs, agents, and friends. The friends were simply conducting a wellness check. The execs and agents? They were less friendly.</p>\n<p>\u201dThat is the worst draft trade I have seen in over a decade,\u201d one Eastern Conference executive lamented.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey should all be fired next year when that becomes a top 5 pick,\u201d relayed another.</p>\n<p>One after another\u2014 it was a ruthless bombardment. \u201dAre they not aware of how good that pick is gonna be?\u201d This line of questioning from one high level executive left me searching for answers across the next few days. Here is what I was able to dig up.</p>\n<p>The League Does Not Respect Pelicans\u2019 Decision Makers:</p>\n<p>The league wide skepticism on the Pelicans started when Joe Dumars was named the head of basketball operations and only grew when Troy Weaver was brought into the fold. When the Pelicans traveled up to Chicago for the NBA Draft Combine a month prior, the league had already placed a target on their back.</p>\n<p>\u201dMan they were killing them up there,\u201d one agent told me, referring to rival front offices. \u201cThey think they (the Pelicans) got F\u2014in idiots in charge. It got so bad, I just felt sorry.\u201d Teams were already jockeying for the privilege to conduct the first trade with the Pelicans as more than one executive jokingly expressed to me that the Pelicans are going to be their first call.</p>\n<p>It was the Indiana Pacers that ended up gaining the privilege of being first. When the Pelicans traded the lightly protected 2026 pick from the Pacers for the rights to pick 23 in this draft, rival executives raised their eyebrows. What was the rush to conduct this move while the Pacers were still in the finals? Just hours after Shams broke the trade, the Pacers announced Haliburton has been diagnosed with a calf strain. The optics pointed to a team that had been duped.</p>\n<p>Haliburton would go on to tear his Achilles tendon just a few days later, lending credibility to criticisms being levied by rival teams regarding the Pelicans\u2019 decision making. The trade should have been executed after the finals. There was no reason the same deal would not have been on the table. The miscalculation was not a grave one, but it was one big enough to reinforce the priors for other teams\u2014 the Pelicans are a mark and do not understand risk.</p>\n<p>Sure enough, the league\u2019s collective belief on the Pelicans\u2019 lack of risk assessment would be proven true. The Pelicans would trade the unprotected 2026 draft pick which was the better of their own and Milwaukee to move up 10 spots in the draft\u2014 to draft a player Troy Weaver was fixated on in Derik Queen. In totality, the Pelicans traded away three shots at top 10 pick for the 13th overall pick. All three shots featured a team with a starting point guard who had suffered a torn Achilles.</p>\n<p>One league executive would tell me their internal models valued the traded pick as having the second highest probability for becoming number one overall next season. Suffice to say\u2014 the league was stunned, and so was Atlanta.</p>\n<p>The Hawks could not believe their good fortune. While the Pelicans would spend the next 24 hours facing enormous backlash for their reckless decision making, Hawks executives weren\u2019t shy about sharing the details behind deal\u2019s lopsided structure with rival teams.</p>\n<p>One Eastern executive with knowledge of how the conversation went from Atlanta\u2019s perspective described a perplexing scene. When Senior Vice President Troy Weaver made the call to Atlanta\u2019s Bryson Graham, Graham couldn\u2019t believe what was actually being offered. Graham asked for clarification multiple times to confirm the unprotected pick was indeed part of the deal. It got to the point where Hawks General Manager, Onsi Saleh, called Joe Dumars directly to confirm for himself. The Hawks waited nervously for Dumars to confirm, hoping he would not realize what was going on and walk the trade back. But the Pelicans persisted and the Hawks got their steal.</p>",

Zhou Qi thought for a moment and said:</p>\n<p>\"If I were to give any advice, I think the most important thing is to maintain a balanced mindset. The U.S. and Australia are quite different. In the U.S., there are a lot of Black players. Their playing style, physicality, and ways of expressing themselves are all very different from ours. Once you get to the NBA, to be honest, they don't really respect us deep down. They may not say it outright, but they'll express it in other ways.\"</p>\n<p>Hearing this, Yang Yi immediately said, \u201cSo he\u2019s definitely going to get bullied!\u201d</p>\n<p>Zhou Qi nodded and continued,<br />\n\"Exactly. That\u2019s why mindset is especially important at that point. How you perceive your own role or position will shape your mentality over there.\"</p>\n<p>Zhou Qi then added,<br />\n\"Later on, I spent some time in Australia, and it was only after coming back to China that I truly felt the difference. There aren\u2019t many Black players in Australia, and I also played there for a while.\"</p>\n<p>--</p>",

Certainly, Smith and his tag team partner Skip Bayless contributed the rings-above-all mindset to the NBA and trashed multiple generations of stars along the way. Certainly, they have disparaged and demeaned, ranted and raged, all under the guise of \u2018debate.\u2019 What else?</p>\n<p>He takes far more from the NBA than he has ever given; the only time he gives as good as he gets is when he is exchanging barbs with the league\u2019s biggest stars. That includes just this week during the NBA Finals, when he made a point of diminishing Pacers G Tyrese Haliburton over a perceived slight. He went further earlier in the year, threatening to air dirty laundry of LeBron James and then making references to disputed claims about James\u2019 attendance at Kobe Bryant\u2019s 2020 memorial service \u2014 an insinuation for which he later apologized.</p>\n<p>Smith\u2019s threats are a particularly bizarre character trait. Whether Kevin Durant years ago or James earlier this season, Smith appears to believe he has something on these players \u2014 that his bully pulpit is one he can weaponize to not just criticize players when warranted, but to shame them; to harm their public standing, perceptions of their ability, and their careers.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Don\u2019t know how to explain it other than shock. Words cannot express the pain of this letdown. The frustration is unfathomable. I\u2019ve worked my whole life to get to this moment and this is how it ends? Makes no sense.</p>\n<p>Now that I\u2019ve gotten surgery, I wish I could count the number of times people will tell me I\u2019m going to \u201ccome back stronger\u201d. What a cliche lol, this shit sucks. My foot feels like dead weight fam. But what\u2019s hurting most I think is my mind. Feel like I\u2019m rambling, but I know this is something I\u2019ll look back on when I\u2019m through this, as something I\u2019m proud I fought through. It feels good to let this shit out without y\u2019all seeing the kid ugly cry.</p>\n<p>At 25, I\u2019ve already learned that God never gives us more than we can handle. I know I\u2019ll come out on the other side of this a better man and a better player. And honestly, right now, torn Achilles and all, I don\u2019t regret it. I\u2019d do it again, and again after that, to fight for this city and my brothers. For the chance to do something special.</p>\n<p>Indy, I\u2019m sorry. If any fan base doesn\u2019t deserve this, it\u2019s y\u2019all. But together we are going to fight like hell to get back to this very spot, and get over this hurdle. I don\u2019t doubt for a second that y\u2019all have my back, and I hope you guys know that I have yours. I think Kobe said it best when in this same situation. \u201cThere are far greater issues/challenges in the world then a torn achilles. Stop feeling sorry for yourself, find the silver lining and get to work with the same belief, same drive and same conviction as ever.\u201d And that\u2019s exactly right. I will do everything in my power to get back right.</p>\n<p>My journey to get to where I am today wasn\u2019t by happenstance, I\u2019ve pushed myself every day to be great. And I will continue to do just that. The most important part of this all, is that I\u2019m grateful. I\u2019m grateful for every single experience that\u2019s led me here.

You turned on the TV, flipped to the game and cheered or booed \u2014 with your family, your neighborhood, your city. Being a fan was simple. It was community.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis community is dying, because some of its shared moments are disappearing. Take the N.B.A. playoffs. Wanted to watch the Denver Nuggets? </p>\n<p>You needed to shell out at least $8.99 a month for NBA TV \u2014 unless you happened to live in Denver, in which case you had to spend an additional $20 a month for a regional basketball streaming subscription.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFor decades, our national sports leagues \u2014 the National Football League, the National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball, the National Hockey League \u2014 operated more like civic institutions. </p>\n<p>These organizations may have always chased the mighty dollar, but they also wanted their sports to last. </p>\n<p>And as such, they cared about strengthening such powerful intangibles as local pride, generational fandom and public ritual. Tradition was good business. Community built loyalty. Loyalty built value.</p>\n<p>Then came the streaming wars. Starting in the early 2010s, live sports events were one of the last types of programming that guaranteed hundreds of thousands if not millions of real-time viewers, and the leagues began to be flooded with requests from streamers, such as Amazon Prime, Peacock and Max, begging for a piece of the pie. </p>\n<p>At the same time, the leagues were looking for a way to raise the cash required to invest in the lucrative opportunities offered by overseas expansion. </p>\n<p>And that\u2019s when the business of sustaining sports in America took a back seat, and our country\u2019s sports leagues stopped acting like caretakers and started thinking like asset managers.</p>\n<p>The result is that dozens if not hundreds of games that make up America\u2019s national pastimes are being sliced and diced and sold off to the highest bidder \u2014 be that a cable giant, or a streaming upstart, or a regional sports network or a subscription app. </p>\n<p>Games jump from one service to another with so little notice or apparent logic that even some of the biggest superfans struggle to track what\u2019s available where.\u201d</p>",

In his first month, he was given a mandate from owner Robert Sarver: Shed enough salary to escape the luxury tax.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe were, like, exactly eight million over the tax,\u201d Kerr recalled recently to The Athletic. \u201cJust trading Kurt Thomas got us under the tax. And there was only one team, literally one team in the entire league, that could absorb his salary into a slot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSam knew exactly what he was doing,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cI knew how smart he was and how well-prepared for the job he was just from being with (Gregg Popovich) and R.C. (Buford) and learning the ropes from them. I was a young GM. I\u2019m put in this position that I have to make this deal. Business is business. We ended up giving up two unprotected firsts.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kerr traded Phoenix\u2019s 2008 and 2010 first-round picks along with Thomas\u2019 contract. The Suns finished that next season 55-27, delivering Presti and the Thunder not a premium asset, but a valuable tool if utilized correctly.</p>\n<p>Presti used the 24th pick on Serge Ibaka, a young power forward flashing some upside in Europe. </p>\n<p>After Ibaka\u2019s seventh season, on draft night of 2016, Presti sent him to the Magic for Victor Oladipo and the 11th pick. He\u2019d immediately use that draft pick on Domantas Sabonis, bringing in a young starting shooting guard and what appeared to be Ibaka\u2019s long-term replacement at power forward.</p>\n<p>Presti pulled the trigger on a trade the following summer (2017) for Paul George, the replacement co-star next to Westbrook. To acquire George, he sent Oladipo and Sabonis to the Indiana Pacers, the exact package he received for Ibaka.</p>\n<p>Presti traded George to the LA Clippers for a package that included Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and a war chest of draft assets. One of those picks, the No. 12 pick in 2022, was used on Jalen Williams.</p>\n</blockquote>",

That evening, the Indiana Pacers were facing the New York Knicks in Game 2 of the NBA\u2019s Eastern Conference Finals, a game that the Pacers won 114-109 at Madison Square Garden in New York City.</p>\n<p>Initially, police were called because of an alleged fight involving a man, later identified as Jarrett Funke. However, once Funke left the brewery, the caller stated that police did not need to respond.</p>\n<p>Minutes later, an employee of the brewery called police, stating that Funke had reportedly returned to the brewery\u2019s patio. The caller stated that Funke reportedly stabbed a man in the back and was attempting to leave.</p>\n<p>When police arrived, they found two individuals with wounds. The court documents said that one had a stab wound in the back while the other had a laceration in his lower leg.</p>\n<p>In interviews with the two victims, they alleged that Funke approached them at the bar. Funke reportedly \u201csmacked\u201d the Knicks hat off of one of the victims onto the ground. Funke was then reportedly taken outside as he yelled \u201cf\u2014 you, you still have a f\u2014\u2014 problem. Take this outside.\u201d to the two individuals.</p>\n<p>Around five minutes later, the two Knicks fans were outside on the patio when Funke reportedly \u201cstormed through the fence\u201d of the brewery and began attacking the two individuals. One of the victims told police that he \u201cbriefly displayed a black folding pocket knife to deter (Funke) but repocketed it, as he had no intention of using it.\u201d</p>\n<p>A verbal altercation reportedly evolved into a physical one, ending with the two victims being allegedly stabbed by Funke. In an interview with Funke, he reportedly told police that the two Knicks fans were \u201ctalking s\u2014\u201d and claimed that they were the ones who began the altercation.</p>\n<p>Funke claims that one of the Knicks fans pushed him to the ground and \u201cbegan punching him in the face.\u201d The documents said that Funke claims that he \u201cretrieved his pocketknife from his hoodie and swung it around towards (one of the Knicks fans) back with his right hand.\u201d</p>\n<p>However, the documents said that there were multiple witnesses who stated that Funke was the \u201cprimary aggressor in this incident.\u201d</p>\n<p>According to court documents, Funke\u2019s initial hearing is scheduled for Tuesday afternoon in Hamilton County.</p>\n<p>As of this story\u2019s publication, the Indiana Pacers lead the NBA Eastern Conference Finals against the New York Knicks 2-1, with Game 4 scheduled for 8 p.m. on Tuesday at Gainbridge Fieldhouse in downtown Indianapolis.</p>\n</blockquote>",

You can hear the hate dripping from it. Just got a clip of Lonzo Ball getting interviewed by Cameron Brink - egging him on to make fun of KAT and he won't and Brink just starts doing the voice. What the hell is wrong with people? Do they just not understand how fucking rude they seem? it's funny to see clips of Kat, whatever, but the entire media apparatus is borderline bullying bro right now for something he doesn't even publicly identify as. It's disgusting.</p>\n<p>edit: all the replies too scared to say some real choice words and catch a reddit ban. we used to have a word for \"zesty\" online in the 2010s too, and it wasn't necessarily coming from a place of bigotry - we just used it to keep other guys in check about what was acceptable behavior. same thing happening here, just being typed by way softer hands who can't stand behind what they're actually making fun of.</p>",
