Less because I'm interested in dunks, more because I'm interested in this weird sorta data anomaly.</p>\n<p>Officially, Rudy Gobert holds the single-season dunk record with 308 dunks in his 2018-2019 season.</p>\n<p>Dig a little deeper and you discover that the NBA only started recording dunk stats in 1996. You may note that Shaq was drafted to the Magic in 1992. This means that Shaq's first 4 seasons of dunks don't count.</p>\n<p>And then I found this <a href=\"https://hoopsong.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Screenshot-2023-10-14-at-8.57.17-PM.png\">Topps Frequent Flyer basketball card</a> that lists Shaq's rookie season dunk total as 322. Seems kinda bonkers. He blew away the record in his rookie season, and it was just mostly forgotten to time? I figured the card was a misprint or something. </p>\n<p>Curious though, I tracked down a copy of the 1993 Sixers Media Guide on EBay. Sure enough, <a href=\"https://hoopsong.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Untitled-design-2-1-jpg.webp\">on page 146</a>, it lists Shaq's 1992 dunk total as 322. It also lists his season high single-game dunk total as 13 (debatably, another record). If you're not familiar with the Sixers Media Guide and Harvey Pollack, this stuff is very reliable.</p>\n<p>So now, Dwight Howard is typically credited as the career all-time dunk leader with 2,950 dunks. If you take Shaq's official career dunk total and add just that rookie season total, you get 2,948 dunks. Pretty sure he knocked down those 3 dunks and then some in the 3 additional seasons he played before dunk stats were introduced.</p>\n<p>I just find this super interesting. We're awfully obsessed with data these days. It's getting to the point where we can analyze an entire playing field at specific timestamps. But for the majority of pro sports history you had to scrape together what you could from newspapers, books and memory. </p>\n<p>And yet, in an attempt to frame discussion and debate in NBA media, it's convenient to just dismiss the numbers that you can't bring up on bballreference. And I get that we have to draw the lines somewhere, but this is data collected and printed by a very highly regarded NBA employee who basically set the bar for statistical analysis in the NBA. </p>\n<p>There's a similar story that comes up with the triple-double debate. Long story short, Wilt probably had more triple-doubles than Westbrook by a lot, and they were almost all on blocking. But there's much less proof of that one.</p>",

Lillard said he was in the eighth grade when LeBron made his NBA debut and to this day marvels at how James exceeded the expectations placed upon his career while under unprecedented scrutiny.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was watching him on ESPN back then, so to have that type of hype and to live up to it and then some,\u201d Lillard said, \u201cto come out as your all-time leading scorer in this league, to win how he\u2019s won, to be as scrutinized as he is and has been. \u2026 I can just respect how he (has handled the pressure).\u201d</p>\n<p>Antetokounmpo\u2019s first season was James\u2019 last in Miami.

Then James left for Los Angeles, where he became the first player in NBA history to be the best player on title teams in three cities.</p>\n<p>Giannis now has two MVPs and one championship to his name. He said James has provided the \u201cblueprint\u201d for any star seeking longevity atop the sport.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor 21 years, you never get in trouble, to be able to take in his family, protect this family, raise his kids the right way, you know, be happily married, all those things, it\u2019s perfect,\u201d Antetokounmpo said. \u201cHe\u2019s kind of like setting the blueprint for the rest of us to go forward. That\u2019s what I want. I want to be able to do what I do on the court consistently, be good, be healthy, be available for my team, be able to, you know, raise my family in a bubble away from what I do on the court for them to have a normal life as much as I can. Stay out of trouble.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd hopefully one day, you know, when I\u2019m done from the game of basketball \u2026 maybe you mention me? I don\u2019t know.

He will run Mosaic, a $200 million venture capital fund that he just raised with his longtime business partner, Rudy Cline-Thomas.</p>\n<p>Iguodala\u2019s disclosure ends years of speculation. The 39-year-old had suggested that last year\u2019s season would be his last, only to shoot down rumors about it earlier this year. But now is the time to hang up his sneakers. \u201cIt\u2019s been a blessing to play for that long,\u201d he told DealBook. (He hasn\u2019t fully come to grips with it yet: \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s actually hit me yet,\u201d he said.)</p>\n<p>He\u2019s embracing his next act. Though he and Cline-Thomas had begun buying tech stocks in 2010, the two dived deeply into start-ups when he joined the Warriors in 2013. \u201cWhen I initially went out to the Bay Area, it was my intent to have success on and off the court,\u201d Iguodala said. \u201cI thought about how to get access.\u201d</p>\n<p>That led to meetings with venture capital firms like Andreessen Horowitz, and then to taking stakes in start-ups, including Zoom and the cybersecurity provider Cloudflare.</p>\n<p>It is a model now followed by many pro athletes, from the N.F.L.\u2019s Patrick Mahomes and Aaron Rodgers to Iguodala\u2019s longtime Warriors teammate Steph Curry. \u201cAthletes are becoming smarter and smarter,\u201d Iguodala said, asserting that their competitiveness and an ability to speak to audiences help to sell and scale products.</p>\n<p>Mosaic is now his focus. The firm will home in on seed- and early-stage investments in enterprise software, fintech health care and sports companies. Iguodala and Cline-Thomas closed Mosaic\u2019s first fund \u2014 whose investors included endowments, institutions and founders of companies they have already backed \u2014 in May.</p>\n<p>Mosaic\u2019s investments include Vessel, a builder of modular multifamily homes, and Athletes First, an N.F.L. talent agency and management firm.</p>\n<p>Sports franchise ownership is another focus. Iguodala is a co-owner of Leeds United, an English soccer club; Bay Area F.C., the National Women\u2019s Soccer League team; and, along with former teammates Curry and Klay Thompson, the San Francisco branch of TGL, the upstart golf league co-founded by Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy.</p>\n<p>Iguodala\u2019s highest aspiration? Owning an N.B.A. team. \u201cThe timing has to be right,\u201d he said, but \u201cthat\u2019s definitely the ultimate goal.\u201d</p>\n<p>https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/20/business/dealbook/middle-east-israel-economy.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare</p>",

We just don't want to see what makes it personal.</p>\n<p>I've debated writing anything. But, being vulnerable helps me heal. This isn't new. We've been traded before. Each time we've felt something different but this time it crushed me.</p>\n<p>Our daughter started 1st grade a month ago. Our son started preschool. Our kids go to school with other Bucks children. Their dads walk them in and walk out together. The other women on the Bucks have been my workout partners, my confidants, and my support system. We have had Bible studies, and retreats and shared so many laughs and tears. Not to mention the relationships we have built through our church, our community, and our JLH grantees. All of this is personal to us. It's our life. There's no business to any of that.</p>\n<p>Milwaukee was home.</p>\n<p>\"On Wednesday, my husband took a nap. He woke up to news that he had been moved. No warning, no heads up, not even a conversation that it could be a possibility. Just, it's done. Now move on because 'it's not personal, it's business'. </p>\n<p>I'm not sharing this to say we are entitled to anything. I'm sharing this to say we are human beings whose kids develop friendships with other kids in our community, we are people who value family and friendships and invest in the cities we play in. We don't just take from the city we play in, we give to the city we play in and we give our all.</p>\n<p>So, yes, this is more than business. Not because we're offended by it but, because we are people, we're humans, we have relationships, dreams, and a connection to where we play.</p>\n<p>As I write this, we are grieving the loss of that while celebrating the hope and the joy of what's ahead. The growth is in allowing ourselves to feel this pain now and turn it into power for how we move forward. That's who we are and that's who we always will be</p>\n<p>Imagine a world where we didn't hide behind the business of things, where we didin't treat one another like commodities, instead we saw each other as valuable pieces of a human community meant to serve one another in a mosaic of ways.</p>\n<p>Imagine if we didn't just put dollar signs on athletes. Imagine if we invested in them as humans, as incredible forces for good, if we had the same expectations for ourselves i our everyday lives that we have for every athlete that steps into their sarena. We expect effort. We expect focus. We expect integrity. We expect greatness. What if our standard for business was the same? In other words, imagine if it was personal AND business. That's the world I want to create.</p>\n</blockquote>",
