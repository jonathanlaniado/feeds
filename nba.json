Beginning the following summer, if the Warriors are still into that second level of the tax bracket (where they currently live), they\u2019ll be hit with a handful more punitive penalties, which include the loss of the mini midlevel exception, an inability to add buyout players in-season and frozen draft picks.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s been viewed as a no go for the Warriors internally. They\u2019re remodeling their roster with the intention of ducking the second apron next summer and maintaining flexibility. It was a core reason for the Poole-for-Chris Paul trade. Poole is owed $30.1 million for the 2024-25 season. Paul\u2019s $30 million that season is fully non-guaranteed until June 28, able to be completely shed, if needed.</p>\n<p>That Poole-for-Paul swap should be viewed (among other things) as a clear sign of the Warriors\u2019 commitment to keeping Thompson. He\u2019s owed $43.1 million this upcoming season. An alternate path to duck under the second apron would\u2019ve been to let Thompson\u2019s contract expire and allow him to walk. But they\u2019ve been firm in their intent to eventually extend him, and Thompson has maintained a desire to return.</p>\n</blockquote></div>",

I think that Dra\u017een, Dino, Divac, and Sabonis have done things that he hasn't touched yet, although I believe he will. But, realistically, if Sabonis was now in the NBA at the age of 24, or Dra\u017een, or Dino, or me... My people, if we used to watch the NBA on TV, we would certainly be much better than then.

Every player with 34,000 minutes is also either 35 years old or has played 1000 games.</p>\n<p>Jrue Holiday (975 career games) will qualify at some point this season, while Draymond Green (913 games) and Paul George (901 games ) will likely qualify at some point next season.

He had a handle and could pass but was very very unrefined. Embiid was trained under American AAU training and had just started playing basketball when he came to america yet is never used as an example of American training.

So I expect the whole you know what debate to ensue, but let\u2019s just try to appreciate some of these numbers I\u2019ve observed.</p>\n<p>LeBron will play into the 2024-2025 season. There is no doubt about it. If there is any slither of a chance that LeBron can play with his son Bronny in the NBA, he\u2019ll make it happen. This season is not being treated as a farewell parade, this is just another final chance at a championship with the Lakers.</p>\n<p>So with that made clear, LeBron will <em>almost certainly</em> break the 40,000 total career points mark, and will be on the court as a 40 year old in his 22nd NBA season.</p>\n<p>40,000 points, 40 years of life.</p>\n<p>If LeBron was drafted to the NBA out of the womb (stay with me), he would have averaged 1000 points per year for every year of his life. Over 82 games in a season, that\u2019s 12.2 points per game.</p>\n<p>It would take a newborn baby 40 years at 12.2 ppg to touch his record. How many NBA players have averaged over 12 points in their career? How many averaged over 12 points in a single season?</p>\n<p>I can\u2019t give you the exact number unfortunately, consider the average points per game for the average NBA player is around 9, 1 career year of LeBron\u2019s life would be worth <em>more</em> than at least 50% of the entire history of the NBA\u2019s player bases career. But I can put it into another perspective</p>\n<p>If you split LeBron\u2019s life into two 21 year stints in the NBA at 12.2 ppg, 82 games, he would have 2 careers with 21,000 total points.</p>\n<p>There have been 50 players in the history of the NBA to reach 20,000 total points over their career.</p>\n<p>LeBron reaches the top 50 all time points in 2 seperate lives.</p>\n<p>And while we play fantasy with these obviously absurd reaches, we need to remember that LeBron didn\u2019t play 82 games a year, nor did he / has he played for 40 years in the NBA</p>\n<p>He will play 22 seasons. Averaging no less than the 20.9 ppg in his rookie season. The fastest to reach every single 1000 point milestone for his time.</p>\n<p>Oh, and he\u2019ll do this all while also finishing with well over 10,000 rebounds AND assists. That\u2019s a 40 point triple double\u2026 x1000.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s appreciate greatness while we still can.</p></div>",
