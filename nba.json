During Monday's episode of The Hoop Collective, ESPN's Tim Bontemps explained that Davis' trade value isn't as high as many would expect for a player of his caliber. \"The idea of trading Anthony Davis has everyone trained to think, well, they're gonna get three firsts, two swaps, they're gonna get two young players and they're gonna get all this stuff,\" Bontemps said around the 33:00 mark. \"I shouldn't say it's not gonna happen... but, you talk to people in the league, there's not a lot of teams that are lining up to take on a 35-year-old Anthony Davis making $63 million, and you have to assume that he's gonna opt into that deal.</p>",
