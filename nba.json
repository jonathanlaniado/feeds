            "content_html": "<p>Source: https://open.spotify.com/show/4mOLvZqMud0JromeBgLpIh</p>\n<p>The Dallas Mavericks are reportedly facing a conundrum when it comes to potentially trading star big man Anthony Davis. During Monday's episode of The Hoop Collective, ESPN's Tim Bontemps explained that Davis' trade value isn't as high as many would expect for a player of his caliber. \"The idea of trading Anthony Davis has everyone trained to think, well, they're gonna get three firsts, two swaps, they're gonna get two young players and they're gonna get all this stuff,\" Bontemps said around the 33:00 mark. \"I shouldn't say it's not gonna happen... but, you talk to people in the league, there's not a lot of teams that are lining up to take on a 35-year-old Anthony Davis making $63 million, and you have to assume that he's gonna opt into that deal.</p>",

Two LeBron associates are among those cooperating</p>\n<p>As a result of the charges filed against Damon Jones, a former NBA player and LeBron James\u2019 former shooting coach who had special access to the Lakers, Wachtell investigators are expected to seek documents, including cell phones and phone records, from at least 10 Lakers employees. Per league sources, Lakers assistant trainer Mike Mancias and executive administrator Randy Mims are among the employees who are already cooperating and who voluntarily handed their cell phones over to investigators.</p>\n<p>Both Mancias and Mims are employed by the Lakers because of their ties to James. The fresh scrutiny is expected to examine their relationship with Jones.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe NBA engaged an independent law firm to investigate the allegations in the indictment once it was made public,\u201d an NBA spokesman told The Athletic in a statement. \u201cAs is standard in these kinds of investigations, a number of different individuals and organizations were asked to preserve documents and records. Everyone has been fully cooperative.\u201d</p>\n<p>Prosecutors say that Jones used information disclosed to him by a team trainer on one occasion.</p>\n</blockquote>",

            "content_html": "<p>How big of a problem is the Clippers controversy for the NBA?</p>\n<p>If you ask Pablo Torre, who first broke the story of Kawhi Leonard\u2019s $28 million \u201cno-show\u201d endorsement deal with green-banking company Aspiration about a month ago on his podcast Pablo Torre Finds Out, it\u2019s \u201cthe defining scandal of Adam Silver\u2019s tenure as commissioner.\u201d </p>\n<p>If you ask Mark Cuban, it\u2019s no problem at all. \u201cI don\u2019t think the Clippers did anything wrong,\u201d he told Front Office Sports on Thursday over email. \u201cSo zero problem.\u201d </p>\n<p>Torre has certainly uncovered compelling evidence that raises many questions. Why did Clippers owner Steve Ballmer continue putting money in Aspiration\u2014and also in the personal charity of cofounder Joe Sanberg\u2014even after news broke that Aspiration was under investigation by the feds? Why did his Clippers co-owner Dennis Wong invest in it, too? In what world is a $28 million player endorsement deal involving no ads or appearances normal? </p>\n<p>The NBA has initiated an investigation to attempt to answer these questions. Such investigations take months, not weeks, and the league knows the public\u2019s attention span is short. Here\u2019s an easy prediction: This one won\u2019t end with the NBA making Ballmer sell the team like the Donald Sterling investigation did. Depending on what the league finds, it could yield anything from a major to a minor punishment to nothing at all. The NBA could conclude it buys Ballmer\u2019s thin explanation that Aspiration \u201cconned me.\u201d</p>\n<p>I\u2019m more interested in how a little-known carbon-credits fintech company secured a $300 million deal as an official \u201cfounding sponsor\u201d of an NBA team\u2014a price and designation that required NBA approval.</p>\n<p>The situation reminds me very much of FTX, the fraudulent crypto exchange that launched in 2019, surged to a $32 billion valuation by early 2022, and collapsed by the end of that same year. Along the way, FTX cozied up to Tom Brady and Gisele B\u00fcndchen, plus a slew of athlete endorsers. (Aspiration had Drake and Leo DiCaprio.) In March 2021, FTX entered a 19-year, $135 million stadium naming rights deal with the Miami Heat. </p>\n<p>Why did the Heat, NBA, and city of Miami trust that a company that had existed for less than two years would be around for 19 years? In an interview with FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried\u2014now serving a 25-year sentence in a California prison\u2014in May 2021, I asked him that. He smiled and said, \u201cIt\u2019s been a pretty good year for us. To the point where, frankly, we don\u2019t need to rely on the other 18 years to have the funds for this.\u201d By January 2023, the company was dead and its logo stripped from the Heat arena.</p>\n<p>I asked Silver about the league\u2019s approval process for team sponsors onstage at our Tuned In summit in New York on Sept. 16. \u201cThis was not something that was on our radar to even be thinking about,\u201d he responded. \u201cWhen this concludes, we\u2019ll take a fresh look at our rules in terms of companies that players are investing in, and owners.\u201d</p>\n<p>But then he argued that the NBA can\u2019t fully look into every team sponsor. </p>\n<p>\u201cThere are literally thousands of deals that cover all our teams,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd these are brands that have major investors, major funds\u2014that was certainly clear of the crypto world at the time. And so, yes, there\u2019s a league approval process, but it doesn\u2019t go deep into interviewing executives for every deal that comes through the league office.\u201d</p>\n<p>And in response to my mention of FTX, Silver appeared to suggest that because crypto prices are up right now, little-known crypto companies look less shady.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s go back to those [crypto] deals,\u201d he said. \u201cNow crypto\u2019s back up. We have deals with some of the crypto companies now, and now the market is killing, going crazy on crypto. So is there a different view now? I\u2019m just saying, we live in a market economy, there is a government that regulates these industries, there are teams and team owners that are risking their reputations and brands.\u201d </p>\n<p>I am certainly not suggesting the NBA needs to interview executives from every team sponsor to ensure they\u2019re honest and aboveboard. That would not be realistic. But clearly it should more closely scrutinize sponsors at the $300 million level. Because you have to wonder how many more Aspirations there are across the NBA\u2014and other leagues, too.</p>\n<p>Source:\u00a0https://frontofficesports.com/clippers-aspiration-fiasco-recalls-another-doomed-nba-sponsorship/</p>",

The auditory hallucinations, diagnosed in 2021 as schizophrenia, turned the big-hearted, caring side of his personality his family loved into a hypervigilant, protective paranoia that his parents, Elisabeth and Jeffrey, tried to de-escalate. As a last resort, they would call in Marta, a licensed therapist, and Duncan, who was Eli's \"whisperer.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<blockquote>\n<p>The voices were \"all about us being in danger,\" Marta said.</p>\n<p>Duncan said: \"The real challenge of that was the volatility. He would call me, he would make sure I was safe. He made sure I was OK. ... And then he could hang up. And sure enough, maybe, you know, 15 to 20 minutes later, he called me again.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo of course, in that stretch, I think, probably the greatest challenge was finding ways to compartmentalize and still try to perform. I always kept in perspective, like he\u2019s the one going through it. And obviously it impacts us as a family. We were all sort of constantly anxious and on edge, but that was never the priority, making sure we were OK. It was always making sure he was OK.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"It was this weird juxtaposition that I was sort of living my dream, really our dream, because it\u2019s what my brother wanted, too,\" he said. \"And then going 35 miles up the road and seeing this totally different experience of what my own flesh and blood, you know, my big brother was going through.</p>\n<p>\"Those are really some of the most challenging aspects in years for me, because he was so close. But in reality, it felt like he was so far. I would try to always have these points of contact, but it was really hard.\"</p>\n</blockquote><div><br></div><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0px; position: relative; padding-bottom: 177.778%;\"><iframe class=\"streamable-embed\" src=\"https://streamable.com/o/wii4b1\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>",
