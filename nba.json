The Complaint says that Paul, knowing that Noel was represented by Walters in 2017, told Noel that he \u201cwas a 100 million man\u201d and that Paul could get Noel a max deal if he terminated his relationship with Walters.</p>\n<p>This all allegedly went down at Simmons\u2019 birthday party in Los Angeles, where Paul was sitting next to Noel during the dinner portion of the event. Following the party, Noel parted ways with Walters and signed a Standard Player Agent Contract (SPAC) with Paul. Noel also purportedly took Paul\u2019s advice and ended prior ongoing negotiations with the Dallas Mavericks that would have paid him $70 million over 4-years, in favor of accepting a single-year, $4.1 million qualifying offer with the intention of later seeking a max deal on the free agent market. Paul earned a 4% commission on the qualifying offer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The situation became sour when Noel tore a ligament in his thumb, had surgery to repair the injury, and was forced to miss 42 games that season. According to the Complaint, Paul began to lose interest in Noel as a client.</p>\n<p>\u201cDuring the free agent season which began on July 1, 2018, and after Noel\u2019s one-year contract with Dallas expired, neither Paul nor anyone at Klutch Sports presented any real proposals to Noel in terms of strategies or ideas on how Noel might secure a long-term contract or even a significant contract for the following season,\u201d states the Complaint. \u201cIndeed, as the 2018 NBA free agent season began, no real offers or deals were presented to Noel on the first day of free agency.\u201d</p>\n<p>Noel says that Paul had nothing to do with Noel then signing with the Oklahoma City Thunder and that, instead, Russell Westbrook and Paul George recruited him to join them for that franchise. Noel signed a 2-year, $3.75 million league-minimum deal with the team, and Paul was paid a 2% commission.</p>\n<p>Paul is criticized for failing to make an effort to try to secure contracts or deals on Noel\u2019s behalf during the 2018-19 NBA season he spent with the Thunder and thereafter. Noel declined a player option on the second year of his deal with the Thunder and instead hit the free agent market. He received no offers from any other teams and was forced to sign another one-year league minimum contract with the Thunder.</p>\n<p>Noel allegedly learned from Brett Brown, who was coaching the Philadelphia 76ers at the time, that the 76ers front office had been trying to contact Paul to discuss a potential deal and that Paul refused to respond. This was purportedly the case with other team representatives who were reaching out as well.</p>\n<p>Eventually, Noel says that he contemplated terminating his representation relationship with Klutch Sports; however, he was persuaded by Lucas Newton of the company that they were working on a 3-year deal with the Thunder that should compensate Noel to the tune of $7 million to $10 million annually. Thus, Noel decided to stay in place with his agency of record.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Then, free agency hit and the first day was quiet. Noel says that he later learned that representatives from the Houston Rockets and Los Angeles Clippers wanted to discuss opportunities with Paul, but that they could not make contact. Leon Rose (who was formerly an agent at Creative Artists Agency but then the President of the New York Knicks) reached out about a deal and Noel ultimately signed a 1-year contract for $5 million.</p>\n<p>Noel finally terminated his relationship with Paul and Klutch Sports in December 2020 and says that the final straw was Noel learning that Paul \u201chad a history of mismanaging and ignoring other clients and costing them significant money.\u201d He believed that Paul and Klutch Sports were only focused on serving their marquee clients, and did not have the capacity to serve Noel as well as players such as Norris Cole or Shabazz Mohammad. After Noel\u2019s first season with the Knicks, he signed a 3-year deal for roughly $32 million and was represented by basketball agent George Langberg on that contract.</p>\n<p>Noel wants to be made whole for losing what he says is $58 million in lost earnings after being led to leave Walters and pass up an offer from the Mavericks for $70 million over 4 years. He says that Paul breached his fiduciary duty by inducing Noel to terminate his representation agreement with Walters and then by failing to do any meaningful work on Noel\u2019s behalf in terms of securing contracts, new endorsement deals, or by offering strategies to Noel on how to maximize his value and earnings.</p>\n</blockquote></div>",

You sign free agents, draft players, make trades, manage the finances, and try to build a dynasty without getting fired.</p>\n<p>Also, it's free. Actually free. That means no microtransactions, no virtual currency, no loot boxes, etc. <a href=\"https://play.basketball-gm.com/\">Click here to play in your web browser</a>, no download/install/login needed.</p>\n<p>I first posted a link here <a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1j1e6q/i_made_a_singleplayer_basketball_management/\">back in 2013</a>, and that's where I got my initial userbase from. The mods have graciously allowed me to post a link here every offseason since then, so I am very appreciative of this community for supporting me.</p>\n<p>Since last year, Basketball GM has kind of taken on a life of its own. During the lockdowns in 2020, I spent basically all my free time working on it. And earlier this year, I <a href=\"https://zengm.com/blog/2021/01/full-time-job/\">quit my day job</a> to focus on Basketball GM full time.</p>\n<p>The end result has been an incredible amount of new features. <a href=\"https://zengm.com/changelog/\">Here's a big giant list of them.</a> It's hard to even summarize the improvements since last year, but I'll try:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://zengm.com/blog/tag/real-players/\">Built-in rosters of real teams/players</a>, going all the way back to 1947. This includes expansion drafts, contraction (in the very old days), relocation, and real players in draft classes up to today. It also optionally includes all historical player stats. At least in some ways, you get a better UI to view real historical data in Basketball GM than on actual basketball websites!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>New features that enhance gameplay and add a lot of depth. A <a href=\"https://zengm.com/blog/2020/09/player-mood/\">new player mood system</a>, a <a href=\"https://zengm.com/blog/2020/08/smarter-contract-generation/\">fancy algorithm to set player contracts</a> (no more players going unsigned because AI teams ran out of money), <a href=\"https://zengm.com/blog/2020/08/jersey-numbers/\">jersey numbers and retired jerseys</a>, tracking of <a href=\"https://zengm.com/blog/2020/08/game-highs/\">game highs</a>, <a href=\"https://zengm.com/blog/2021/05/auto-ticket-prices/\">automatic ticket price optimization</a>, a new <a href=\"https://zengm.com/blog/2021/05/trade-finding-algorithm/\">trade finding algorithm</a>, <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/oQhZenq.png\">new advanced stats</a> (BPM and VORP), players can <a href=\"https://zengm.com/blog/2021/05/play-through-injuries/\">play through minor injuries</a>, <a href=\"https://zengm.com/blog/2020/07/game-sim-realism/\">more realistic game simulation</a>, and more.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Added a bunch of new pages to let you view your league in new ways. <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/GUsHCOS.png\">League stats</a>, your <a href=\"https://zengm.com/blog/2020/08/gm-history/\">GM history</a> across multiple teams, <a href=\"https://zengm.com/blog/2020/11/trade-details/\">trade summaries</a> to see who won or lost a trade, <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/Pl5ITWR.png\">award races</a>, <a href=\"https://zengm.com/blog/2021/02/head-to-head/\">head-to-head team results</a>, <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/9EzWXVK.png\">player game logs</a>, leaguewide <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/NW6UNxO.png\">injuries overview</a>, the <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/pqlZaGf.png\">daily schedule</a>, a <a href=\"https://zengm.com/blog/2020/06/news-feed/\">news feed</a>, and <a href=\"https://zengm.com/blog/tag/frivolities/\">tons of new frivolities</a>, including my personal favorite <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/NEmdu7e.png\">the GOAT Lab</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>There is a <a href=\"https://zengm.com/blog/2020/11/settings-redesign/\">new settings UI</a>, and a ton of new settings: the <a href=\"https://zengm.com/blog/2020/08/elam-ending/\">Elam Ending</a>, more <a href=\"https://basketball-gm.com/manual/customization/schedule-settings/\">schedule</a>/<a href=\"https://zengm.com/blog/2021/08/playoff-settings/\">playoff</a> customization, <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/kjuwN4S.png\">inflation</a>, <a href=\"https://zengm.com/blog/2021/02/customizable-tiebreakers/\">customizable tiebreakers</a>, <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/OiGm4FC.png\">customizable injuries</a>, <a href=\"https://zengm.com/blog/2020/05/beta-real-rosters-back-to-1956/\">gameplay settings</a> (like how often players shoot 3 pointers), the <a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/ivlhui/new_god_mode_option_to_set_the_number_of_players/\"># of players on the court</a> (you can make a 3v3 league), and many more.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://zengm.com/blog/2020/06/league-creation-options/\">Added tons of new \"game modes\".</a> Challenge modes like \"no draft picks\" can be fun to try to overcome. \"Groundhog Day\" lets you play the same season over and over. <a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/gq13b4/new_option_random_debuts_when_creating_a_real/\">\"Random debuts\"</a> lets you shuffle all current and historical real players and randomly puts them in future draft classes. <a href=\"https://zengm.com/blog/2020/08/spectator-mode/\">\"Spectator mode\"</a> lets you just sit back and watch a league, without having to control a team.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>New God Mode stuff to let you exert complete control over your league. For example, you can now <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/juatTlV.png\">rig the draft lottery</a>, <a href=\"https://zengm.com/blog/2020/10/force-win/\">force a win/loss</a> in a specific game, <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/zNqPE0K.png\">regenerate draft classes</a>, <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/arCkswN.png\">clone players</a>, and <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/qrWQRvM.png\">edit award winners</a>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Basically... if you played Basketball GM before but haven't in a little while, <a href=\"https://play.basketball-gm.com/\">give it another shot</a>. Or <a href=\"https://hockey.zengm.com/\">try the hockey version, which is also new this year</a>. So much new stuff!</p>\n<p>Feedback is always welcome, either here or on /r/BasketballGM. Most of the new features mentioned above were suggested by users, and I'm always looking for more ideas to make Basketball GM even better!</p></div>",

I\u2019m like, \u201cYo, man, how did you get here?\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cYeah, man, I was hanging out at this bar, some people asked me where I was going, they said they were going to the same place, so, shit, I just hopped in the cab and split a cab with them.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat people?\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cThat couple over there.\u201d And it was like two married, middle-aged White people.</p>\n<p>DeGregorio: Klay\u2019s first contract, they were negotiating, and in the middle he had to leave.

During the next timeout, I remember Monta Ellis just ripped into this rookie: \u201cYou\u2019re taking too many shots. Pass the ball. You\u2019re just a rook.\u201d That type of deal. I remember watching Klay the whole time, and he never flinched. He never wavered. The very next offensive possession, ball swings, goes to Klay. He takes the first shot and makes a 3. I\u2019m thinking, \u201cThis kid is an ice-cold killer.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ezeli: One game, I think we were up three with about 15 seconds left and somebody threw the ball to Klay. At this point, you just hold the ball, right? As soon as it touches his hands, Klay shoots it. I can\u2019t remember if he made it or not, but I remember his conversation with Draymond afterwards. Draymond was like, \u201cYo, what were you doing?! Why would you shoot that?\u201d And Klay said, \u201cDog, they pay me to shoot the ball.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote></div>",

This is from tweets by @FakeTJHawke, linked where applicable.</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/FakeTJHawke/status/1424849460543295499</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But the Bucks were struggling, dropping a game to Charlotte on December 23, right before Christmas. Players returned to the locker room dejected, silent. Everyone was ready for the next two days off with their families.</p>\n<p>\"Zaza,\" Kidd said, turning to Pachulia but addressing the group, \"do you think this was a winnable game?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes it was a winnable game,\" Pachulia said.</p>\n<p>\"And do you think we deserve the next two days off?\"</p>\n<p>Pachulia couldn't believe Kidd had put him in that situation, threatening to ruin Christmas. Pachulia tried to strike a diplomatic tone: \"You know what, Coach\u2013I understand the frustration. We're all frustrated because this was a game we were supposed to win. We didn't give enough effort. But at the same time, this is a holiday. Christmas is important to our families. It's not about us; it's about our families. Guys have made plans.\"</p>\n<p>Kidd then turned to Dudley. \"What do you think? Should we take these next two days off?\"</p>\n<p>Dudley, too, gave a diplomatic answer.</p>\n<p>But Kidd wasn't satisfied. \"See you guys tomorrow at 9:00 a.m.\"</p>\n<p>\"Whoa, whoa, whoa,\" players said. \"What do you mean?\"</p>\n<p>\"We're going to have practice tomorrow.\"</p>\n<p>\"We booked flights to different places!\"</p>\n<p>\"I don't care. You guys get paid to do a job, so you're doing your job tomorrow. Things change.\"</p>\n<p>Practice the next morning was <em>ugly</em> . Kidd <em>went</em> at Sanders. Called him a \"piece of shit,\" a \"terrible player.\" The team ran and ran and ran and ran, like a college team would. \"I don't think I've done that since I left J-Kidd,\" Knight says. \"It was not normal.\"</p>\n<p>Players had to finish a fast-break drill in twenty-two seconds, but twenty-seven was the team's best record. They did it over and over until they made it. Some were bent over, panting, cramping. Practice lasted three hours, and then Kidd made players lift weights and do pool exercises. Half the team didn't know how to swim, but Kidd made everyone run in the pool\"</p>\n<p>\"Everybody was so tired that nobody was thinking about Christmas,\" Pachulia says. \"We didn't have energy left to open gifts.\" </p>\n<p>Kidd continued to berate Sanders, though, calling him \"pathetic.\" Sanders couldn't handle it. Where he was in his life, his career, this <em>practice</em>, all his mistakes, all his frustrations, he felt his entire body turn to jelly as he cramped up from head to toe. \"I had a full-body convulsion,\" Sanders says. \"My body broke down. Physically I couldn't take it, and mentally I really couldn't take it.\"</p>\n<p>Sanders asked to be excused to the bathroom. \"Oh, don't worry,\" Kidd said as Sanders walked away. \"We'll wait, then run some more.\" Sanders left the facility and took himself to the hospital, spending the night there. Few knew what happened in the aftermath, and he didn't have the energy then to talk about it.</p>\n<p>\"I don't think he's a bad person,\" Sanders says about Kidd, \"but mentally, he kind, like, brain fucked me a little. It was a lot of, I love you, kiss you on the cheek, now it's all about money, who cares about your mental health, your body breaking down.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm happy. I'm in a much better place now,\" he says. \"I'm sorry it had to go out the way it did.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>More quotes about Kidd</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FakeTJHawke/status/1424869328084680705\">Benching Giannis to prove a point he was wrong about</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FakeTJHawke/status/1424873717310664704\">Punishing the team because Thon Maker had the wrong kind of phone</a></p>\n<p>Seems like a peach.</p></div>",

Cade is an unathletic bust, Scottie Barnes is the next Scottie Pippen, and probably one or two Kevin Knox strays here and there as well.</p>\n<p>As frequent as the overreactions is the flood of people who come in screaming \"Summer League doesn't matter, REMEMBER TRAE YOUNG!!???\" </p>\n<p>So if you're a new or old NBA fan, you might be asking yourself, what can I even get out of watching summer league? </p>\n<p>I wrote a small guide a couple of summers ago that I think is still relevant. I've updated it with current examples for the post below. I'm also linking the original post so you can all clown me for things I said that aged like milk. I hope you all enjoy.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/cblgoj/oc_so_if_playing_well_or_poorly_in_summer_league/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/cblgoj/oc_so_if_playing_well_or_poorly_in_summer_league/</a> </p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><strong>Disclaimer: I am far from an expert. But I\u2019m a tape and tactics junky who has dabbled in some VERY LOW level coaching. If you are a very experienced X/O basketball fan, most of what I\u2019m saying will be obvious. Hell most of it is logical anyway. But hopefully even ya\u2019ll can get something out of this, and please feel free to chime in with thoughts and suggestions (or disagreements!) to help everyone get the most out of their summer league experience</strong></p>\n<p>I love summer league. Besides the first week of Free Agency, it\u2019s the best part of the offseason. Watching everyone from highly touted young players, to low level G-League long shots is an exciting and high stakes event. And while many top players often sit out, they are only a small part of what makes summer league fun. Summer league has just started, and so my examples are only from short spurts of watching on Day One, so look out for examples moving forward.</p>\n<p>The problem is, we still don\u2019t really know what we can learn from summer league. Is it predicative of season performance? Can we learn if players will be good NBA players?</p>\n<p>The first thing to understand is that the answer to those questions has usually been a pretty resounding \u201cno\u201d. Playing well in summer league does not mean you will play well in the NBA. Similarly, performing poorly in summer league is far from a death sentence. And yet, part of summer league, outside of total performance, can actually be incredibly helpful to understand if the player will make an impact during their rookie year, so long as you don\u2019t forget the context in which a player is playing. (Rookie, some NBA experience? 19 years old or 22 years old? These things are always important to keep in mind.)</p>\n<p>So what do we look for in summer league that can be relevant to the players career?</p>\n<p>The key to understanding summer league is that we are looking predominantly at a few traits, which mostly cannot be found in a box score. These traits can be predicative of <em>early</em> NBA success. They are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Does the player understand the feel of the NBA game</li>\n<li>Does the player possess projectionable NBA skills</li>\n<li>Does the player have a repeatable and efficient shooting form</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Each of these can be strong indicators of whether the player can have early value in the NBA. <strong>It is important to note that because these players are so raw, this can tell you a lot about their immediate value. It will tell us much less (if anything at all) about their long term value. Players improve or regress</strong> It is also important to not live at the summer league box scores. Because of the tiny sample size, and differing levels of experience, and over relevancy of teammates, stats really don\u2019t give us a particularly good summer league picture. So put your statistics, both advanced as well as basic, aside for the time being and let\u2019s dive into some skill evaluation.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s get into the big 3:</p>\n<p><strong>Does the player understand the feel of the NBA game</strong></p>\n<p>The NBA operates predominantly as a spread offense league. Spacing is valued, attacking the basket becomes critical, and a mid-range game (not necessarily shooting, but occupying that space as a roller/facilitator/cutter) and most importantly the pick and roll, becomes a staple of most league offenses. On defense, NBA teams play comparatively very little zone over the course of the season  (I know, I know Raptors/Mavs fans. I'm just saying in comparison to some other leagues.) They have extremely complex, help heavy schemes that require quick rotations. These are waaay more complex than anything these players have seen before (with the partial exception of guys who have played high level Euroleague ball, or in certain other overseas leagues. Lookin at you Alperen) Most colleges and many international teams don\u2019t have the same style of play as the NBA. (exceptions like the old Dribble Drive Motion Kentucky Offense have given prospects from UK an advantage during summer league and during their initial NBA seasons. But even those pro style offenses are far from the choreographed dance combined with improv, that define modern NBA offense and defense)</p>\n<p>Watch for prospects that seem to understand NBA movement. Look for shooters who move with the ball to create passing lanes on the dribble drive (When the Wizards get going, watch for Kispert and for the Magic Franz Wagner here. Last night Nesmith couldn't hit a damn thing, but moved really well with the ball. Grimes looks fun too even if he may not enough to stick in the league.) The guys who understand that when a player drives baseline, you either cut weakside, crash to the corner for the spot up, or find space elsewhere, they often retain these skills in the NBA. Similarly, if a player is NOT moving with the dribble drive, that\u2019s a red flag.</p>\n<p>Look for ball handlers in the pick and roll. Get excited about the big ball handlers who can make plays in space and use their size for finishing and passing over the defense. (Cade had some excellent moments here as well as some disappointing moments. Cade showed some of the same concerns as he had in college last night. Looking forward to seeing how he develops over these few games). For smaller ball handlers, do they know how to change speed, attack, keep defenders on their back, and finish over length. (Shariff Cooper is so far ahead of the game on understanding where guys are and how to engage defenders at weird angles, but is really struggling for daylight finishing.) Defensively, are guards dying on picks or are they staying with the play? Are bigs hedging hard every time, or are they dropping low, or do they get caught in the middle (no man\u2019s land)?</p>\n<p>Ask yourself, are the players moving well away from the ball? Or do they just stand there besides a cut here and there? Do they end up running into other players on drives? Do they get in the way of their teammates attacking the rim? (This is a big one for rookies. Players attack the basket so quickly in the NBA, rookies frequently forget to get out of the way.) How are players finishing? Athletes should be leveraging their ability to finish above or around the defense. If they aren't that's a red Are smaller and less athletic players finding ways to avoid the defense by being clever? Maybe that means fakes. Maybe it\u2019s misdirection of which hand or side of the rim they will finish on. Creativity is one of the most important things to look for. Does a player react well and make plays when the offense goes bad (especially look for clever passing and timely off ball cutting, and steals on defense). Do players stay close to their man on defense, or do they lose them off ball because they get caught ball watching? (Jalen Green has deliciously tantalizing potential but is still a classic ball watcher who has some tunnel vision on D.)</p>\n<p>If you are watching closely, you will see a hilariously clear difference between players with NBA experience and those who are young rookies. (Look at, for example, the difference between Payton Pritchard and Theo Maledon, vs. someone like Tre Mann. The NBA experience really makes a difference.)</p>\n<p>One last bonus piece: Do they play fast? Are they decisive? So many players catch the ball and think about what they are going to do with it. They ball stop like crazy. If your name is James Harden or LeBron James, ball stop all you damn please. But if you are going to be a productive NBA role player, you need to be used to immediately dribbling, passing or shooting as soon as you get the ball. The NBA is a game of inches and milliseconds. You can\u2019t give up any advantage. The all time great at this is Iguodala. Dude knows what he wants to do 15 seconds before anyone else on the court. He fidgets as he waits for the ball, seeing an opening that isn\u2019t there yet, and immediately attacking so that as soon as an opportunity to pass, or drive or screen presents itself, he\u2019s already there. In my original post a few years ago I said \"One player who did this so well in summer league and then went on to continue doing so in the NBA is Kyle Kuzma. One of the first clues that he was going to succeed was how quickly he played, attacking closeouts, and using defender\u2019s momentum against them.\"  This didn't age so well, but it did give a good indicator on a player who made an early impact.</p>\n<p><strong>Does the player possess projectionable NBA skills</strong></p>\n<p>How is the player\u2019s ball handling in small spaces? Especially for the bigger players, summer league is a great opportunity to see them handle the ball on the break. Watch the PnR in particular. Do guards keep the ball low? Do they have a high dribble frequency? Do the players slide their feet well on defense? Watch closely for player footwork, both offensively and defensively in the post and on the wings. Do they close out with good form, chopping their feet and staying low as long as they can as they reach the shooter? Do they trip over themselves in the post? Are they getting turned around? (Rui I love you but we gotta get those issues ironed out) These are some of the questions to ask because those are skills that directly translate to the NBA immediately. If a guy is good at boxing out and playing big on the boards, he\u2019s probably going to be pretty damn good at it in the NBA. Check the box outs. Do they play big? Are they physical? When they roll on cuts or after screen, do they create a wide powerful passing target with their shoulders? (Unsurprisingly, Sengun is excellent at creating a wide target and recognizing angles to leverage his otherwise just above average frame. He's one of the most instinctive rebounders I've seen in years. Evan Mobley, while an excellent player, is still very unrefined with little things like these. Also Jeremiah Robinson Earl is an absolute treat to watch move around the court. He so swift in his movement, and is constantly in the right spot.)</p>\n<p><strong>Does the player have a repeatable shooting form</strong></p>\n<p>This is of course, related to the previous trait, but it\u2019s so important and unique it deserves its own category. Shooting is quite possibly the most important part of the NBA. And we can get a great look at it with summer league. Here is the catch: <strong>DO NOT FOCUS ON SHOOTING PERCENTAGE</strong> Summer league is not long enough, and features too many variables to make shooting data reliable. I'm a stats head, but 5 thrown together games of players who have never played together just isn't so helpful. Instead, look at the players shot mechanics. The biggest red flag? The release speed. If a player wants to be a good shooter in the NBA, they almost always need a quick release. They won\u2019t be able to get their shot off otherwise. (One excellent example of a guy the jury should still be out on is Jalen Johnson. An excellent game yesterday, but he had some awkward releases on a few of his shots. If he can really knock down from range in a fluid motion from the catch the way he occasionally showed last night, then the other parts of his game can really come alive. That's a story to watch for this week.)</p>\n<p>Are shooters shooting in a compact way? Are big men able to catch smoothly and go into their shot in one motion? Do players shooting off the dribble gather well as they transfer the ball to their shooting pocket? Are elbows being kept tight, and does anyone have a hitch in their shot? You can succeed with atypical shot mechanics (Someone put in that \u201cHiiii Kevin\u201d thing from SpongeBob, but with KD instead.) but it\u2019s certainly less likely, so it\u2019s something worth watching.</p>\n<p>So there ya go. It\u2019s just a small amount of the many things worth watching in summer league, but hopefully if you were wondering to yourself \u201cWell if being good or bad in summer league doesn\u2019t matter, how can we learn anything?\u201d this can hopefully be a partial answer to that question. There is so much to watch for when we view young prospects, tons of which can give us insight into how they will preform as rookies. I'd love to hear peoples thoughts on what they've seen from summer league yesterday, which players have stood out, and what skill sets they have demonstrated.</p>\n<p><strong>TL:DR</strong> **Summer league can tell you a lot about how players will play in the NBA. It won\u2019t tell you if they will be successful or not, but if you watch these things, you can spot early red flags or areas of promise that will often transfer over to the NBA regular season. Don\u2019t worry about stats. Don\u2019t worry about performance. Watch skill development and see how they adjust to NBA style offense and defense. It is my belief that if you do so, you can have a more fulfilling and productive summer league watching experience.**</p></div>",
