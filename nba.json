The game flows so much better - with teams focusing on fluid ball movement as opposed to isolation scoring. I have never seen basketball be played in such a beautiful way - apart from the 2014 Spurs. The refs are almost too reluctant to blow the whistle. Very rarely do you see players foul hunting for ridiculous calls (looking at you Harden + Trae). Overall, the international rules need to be adopted by the NBA. It would vastly improve their product and make for a better viewing experience.</p></div>",

When faced with the prospect of losing Alex Caruso, the 27-year-old guard whose Bird rights they carried and could thus pay whatever they wanted, they didn't put up any free-agency fight en route to him agreeing to a four-year, $37 million deal with Chicago. According to a source with knowledge of the situation, Caruso's camp went back to the Lakers after the Bulls made their offer and were told that there would be no counter.  </p>\n<p>Considering the many roster holes that remain around the LeBron James/Anthony Davis/Russell Westbrook superstar trio, with only the taxpayer midlevel exception ($5.9 million) and minimum-salary slots at their disposal, it's quite a surprise to hear they didn't make a more spirited push -- or any push, really -- to hold onto Caruso. Forget the part about him being a fan favorite -- that only matters, well, to the fans. But on this team that had such a strong defensive identity, he had grown into a very strong perimeter defender and a valuable rotation player (21 minutes per game in the regular season; 20.1 in the first round against Phoenix).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I have honestly have no idea WTF the Lakers are doing considering he was our best  defender and we have zero way to replace him. Not doing everything to maximize LeBron's last years is stupid as fuck.</p></div>",

A man of action, the saying goes. When there is no shot, he will create one. When there is no path to the basket, he will find one -- through sheer force of will or chutzpah.</p>\n<p>So in the summer of 2019, while the rest of the NBA world fretted over who reigning NBA Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard would choose between the Toronto Raptors and his hometown Los Angeles Lakers or LA Clippers, Westbrook was coming up with a plan to collaborate with him on a homecoming.</p>\n<p>Westbrook had become a father of three the previous November, and while he'd made a home and carved a Hall of Fame legacy in Oklahoma City, the chance to live and play in Los Angeles, where grandparents and his large extended family and friends could visit every day, held deep appeal.</p>\n<p>Teaming up with Leonard would be the fastest way there, so he placed the call, according to multiple sources. But Leonard didn't just take the call as one native son of Los Angeles to another, ponder it and file it away.</p>\n<p>He used it.</p>\n<p>According to multiple sources, Leonard then called Westbrook's teammate in Oklahoma City, Paul George, and told him he'd rather team up with him on a homecoming.</p>\n<p>George had always longed to play in front of his family as well but had formed a close bond with Westbrook in their two seasons together in Oklahoma City and was content to stay.</p>\n<p>Leonard's call upended all of that, though. And within a week, Leonard was teaming up with George -- not Westbrook -- for their hometown LA Clippers.</p>\n<p>While Westbrook began a journey that would take him to three new teams over the next two seasons, each time moving farther from both the NBA championship he'd been chasing his whole career -- and his hometown of Los Angeles. But he never gave up hope of fulfilling those goals.</p>\n<p>His longtime agent Thad Foucher helped guide him through each of those massive trades, which seemed independent of each other until you consider the previously unknown prologue between Leonard and Westbrook, which began the entire chain of events and now looms as a delicious subplot to all future Lakers-Clippers games.</p></div>",

From a free market angle, LeBron will always be underpaid due to the salary cap, but he's a billionaire so nobody should cry for him. And from a cap perspective, AD is on a crazy good contract assuming he can stay healthy(5 yr(s)/$189,903,600). </p>\n<p>For comparison, <a href=\"https://www.spotrac.com/nba/philadelphia-76ers/ben-simmons-20206/\">Ben Simmons</a> signed a 5 year / $177,243,360 rookie contract extension in Summer '19 that kicked in last season. However AD has more flexibility w/a 24/25 ETO, while Ben is locked in through the 24/25 season.</p></div>",

But what do you take away from the Phoenix Suns' run to the Finals before losing to the Milwaukee Bucks?</p>\n<p>Barkley: \u201cIt was amazing. I was really happy for Chris Paul and happy for my city. Living in Arizona, those people were awesome. But Milwaukee was the better team. When I picked Milwaukee to win the series, it was painful for me. I wanted to pick the Suns. But I just didn\u2019t see how the Suns can beat those guys. If you\u2019re not happy for Giannis Antetokounmpo, there\u2019s something wrong with you. He represents everything that is great about basketball.\"</p>\n<p>Q: Giannis has already been a two-time MVP. But how did you see Giannis take his game even to another level more during the Bucks\u2019 championship run?</p>\n<p>Barkley: \u201cI don\u2019t think he took his game to another level. I think the other guys stepped up. I thought the addition of Jrue Holiday, PJ Tucker and Bobby Portis were huge. Those guys are mentally tough. Giannis did Giannis things, and he obviously was special in that close-out game. But the guy won back-to-back MVP\u2019s for a reason. He\u2019s great.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Despite being regarded as a weaker USA team, they were still led by 2 MVPs in Tim Duncan and Allen Iverson.</p>\n<p>Despite the proclamations from r/nba that \"world fucked\", Team USA appears to be very much beatable, having dropped exhibition games to Australia and Nigeria and now a real one to France. Of course, those that follow international basketball knew the USA was vulnerable when they finished <a href=\"https://www.nba.com/news/team-usa-postmortem-world-cup\">7th</a> at the 2019 FIBA World Cup.</p>\n<p>USA still plays the Czech Republic and Iran, both of which are guaranteed wins.

Where\u2019d you get that from?\u201d They assumed he\u2019d learned the scowl from YouTube\u2014where he learned everything in those days.</p>\n<p>Giannis laughed. \u201cOh,\u201d Giannis said casually in a \u201cthis old thing?\u201d kind of tone, \u201cI took it from Westbrook.\u201d</p>\n<p>Giannis\u2019s scowl seemed out of place. Manufactured. \u201cWe\u2019d be like, \u2018Oh, he must have practiced that at home today,\u2019\u201d Knight says. The scowl was coming along, but it still wasn\u2019t loud enough, mean enough.

We\u2019re about to start the Olympics with Team USA undergoing some changes. Bradley Beal is off the team. Kevin Love is off the team. Keldon Johnson and JaVale McGee joined the team. How do you see the Olympics playing out for Team USA?</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Metta World Peace: \u201cFor me, the Olympics is a bitter situation for me. I love the Olympics, and I feel like I\u2019ve been shortchanged. Even though I was a head case and a real volatile player when I did play, I just always felt like I should have had an opportunity to play [for Team USA]. The year I was going to play, I got suspended - and when you talk about legacy, that gold medal is very important to legacy. And I was a player, third-team All-NBA. I should have had a tryout. I remember when I didn\u2019t get called for the Olympics, and I thought at least I\u2019d play on the team that played against the people who got selected (the Select Team). And when that didn\u2019t happen, I called my agent and said, \u2018What the hell is going on here?!\u2019 And we could not get no response. So then, I had to call the Olympic office myself. And I got no return call. And I was like, \u2018Just let me try out.\u2019 I understand I wasn\u2019t the greatest player to be around at that time and some players did not want to play with me, but I was like, \u2018Give me a chance to take that player\u2019s spot.' At that time, in that era, my defense was so incredible, I was going to take someone\u2019s spot. I\u2019m 100 percent sure.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>That would have been the 2004 Olympics in Athens when the U.S. lost to Puerto Rico by 19 in the opener and ended up taking home the bronze.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Metta World Peace: \u201cYeah, you see what I\u2019m saying? We [wouldn\u2019t have] taken home a bronze. We\u2019d have a gold. I wasn\u2019t on that team. The USA had a goal in 2004 and there\u2019s no way we lose with me on that team. There\u2019s no way. How? I\u2019m averaging 24 and the best defender in the world at that point in time. I got Defensive Player of the Year in between sharks and blue whales, Ben Wallace and Duncan and Garnett. This is who I had to navigate through in order to get that award. Hall of Famers. With that being said, I understand why. But I just want people to hear: If I could rewind time, that is something that is supposed to be on my resume. Now, granted, a lot of things are not on my resume because of me, but I got Defensive Player of the Year, I was close to being MVP one year, I got champion, All-Star, everything but the Olympics. But I\u2019ve been to the Olympics in high school. I got the USA high school history. One day, I hope they pick me. Sometimes they pick veterans, they pick guys who don\u2019t play [anymore]. I hope I can play in the Olympics; I deserve it just as much as anybody, I believe. Some people would argue that other people deserve it also. That\u2019s true, but I am the one yapping about it. So hopefully one day an honorary jersey, end of the bench. I even told them I would get the water. I literally called the office. I told my agent, \u2018Can I even be the water boy? Something?\u2019 So every time someone brings up the Olympians, I rant, I rant I rant. I am an Olympian, for sure. I am an Olympian, a gold medalist, and I truly believe that.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen you look at it from a basketball standpoint, in terms of being that professional at that age, I wasn\u2019t. But I was a hell of a basketball player, and I felt like a hell of an American basketball player, one of the best American basketball players in the world. And although I\u2019m very much from Queensbridge and as urban as it gets in the NBA, at the same time I always wanted to represent the USA. And another reason why I wanted to represent the USA: Chris Mullin was an Olympian, I went to St. John\u2019s. Vern Fleming was a gold medalist Olympian, and Vern Fleming is from my neighborhood and everybody knows where I\u2019m from. Vern Fleming experienced all the things I talked about, just picture those situation with Vern Fleming, and he was an Olympian. He\u2019s from the same block, the same exact block as me. There\u2019s a lot of reasons why I wanted to be an Olympian. No matter what anybody says, I am an Olympian, I am a gold medalist. I didn\u2019t cut myself from that team.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>",

The commenter doesn't go into much detail about Middleton, only briefly including him as a prospect to play backup SG/SF. Despite that, its the very first comment including him whatsover on r/nba so it earns a place here.</p>\n<p>The first comment actually <em>focused</em> on Middleton is from two weeks before the draft, where what I assume was a Thunder fan comments on a post asking about what player they think their team will draft: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/v5ix1/who_do_you_think_your_team_will_draft/c51n4e6?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">\"We really need someone who can come off the bench for KD who is an actual SF. Not a tweener, but a swingman. </a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/v5ix1/who_do_you_think_your_team_will_draft/c51n4e6?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">I'm thinking Khris Middleton from Texas A&amp;M. He appears that he would fit pretty well in this system.\"</a></p>\n<p><strong>AFTER THE DRAFT</strong></p>\n<p>The first mention of him after the draft is someone confused about <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/vqrxl/game_thread_2012_nba_draft/c573ozl?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">\"Why Khris Middleton with Doron Lamb, Tyshawn Taylor, and Darius Miller still on the board?\"</a></p>\n<p>In case you're wondering about the fate of those players, Doron Lamb was waived in 2014 and is playing basketball in Europe, Tyshawn Taylor was used by legendary Mavs coach Jason Kidd to get a free timeout by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEqU7JHkfu0\">bumping into him</a> and then waived, and Darius Miller was infamously a walking TPE, although probably the best player out of the three.</p>\n<p>Some more serious draft analysis had him pegged as <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/vsvmf/can_someone_post_this_insider_draft_grades/c57bun6?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">\"a smooth scorer with a great midrange game\"</a>. It's a nice read and seeing the optimism about MKG was a blast of nostalgia.</p>\n<p><strong>THE TRADE</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1jdllz/knight_middleton_and_krastov_to_be_traded_to_the/\">The trade thread</a>.</p>\n<p>To sum up the comments in a nutshell - the name Middleton is mentioned six times and half of those are jokes about Kate Middleton.</p>\n<p>If you ever needed proof Middleton was a throw-in in the trade here it is. Pretty much all of the discussion being had is about Knight/Jennings, although there are a few takes that have aged alarmingly well.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1jdllz/knight_middleton_and_krastov_to_be_traded_to_the/cbdm1b7?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">\"I have a feeling this one is gonna bite the Pistons in the ass.\"</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1jdllz/knight_middleton_and_krastov_to_be_traded_to_the/cbdu1l3?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">\"I think the steal of this trade might have been Khris Middleton. He had flashes last year as a rookie in limited minutes, and if the Bucks learned anything from losing Tobias Harris, it's gonna be to play their youngsters like John Henson and Khris very heavily to see what they are truly capable of.\"</a></p>\n<p>Funnily enough the person who made the comment, /u/noworldforeric also had <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1euzhs/here_is_my_first_round_2013_nba_mock_draft_rnba/ca40cgd?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">a great take on Giannis</a> that ended up in my last post as well, what a visionary.

So basically just BK and 2 guys who won't make the Bucks roster.\"</a></p>\n<p>Funnily enough, once again both these takes are from a user that also featured in my Giannis post <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1fnklc/2013_rnba_mock_draft_15_picks_milwaukee_bucks/cac9lny?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">who predicted that he would be a huge star</a>.</p>\n<p>Honestly I'd say this is the perfect example of how much luck goes into these predictions. Someone with one of the best takes on Giannis also had terrible takes on Middleton, just because of how variable and random trying to predict the potential/ceiling of a player is.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1jtpea/brandon_knight_and_khris_middleton_pose_in_front/cbiwype?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">\"I honestly don't know how Middleton made to the NBA.

Either way first part is just weird given he was on the watchlist for the Wooden Award in college and unanimous addition to the All-Big 12 team.</p>\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> An explanation from /u/nibbinoo8 and /u/BEE_REAL_ :</p>\n<p>Deandre Jordan also went to Texas A&amp;M and was seen as a complete disappointment, but managed to be a great player anyways, so he was suggesting that there was a chance Middleton would have a similar career path. </p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1jlyth/what_move_has_your_team_made_in_the_past_few/cbg7nwz?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">\"I loved that trade. We didn't give up any picks or expiring contracts, and Middleton and Kravstov weren't going to do much of anything. It was effectively a straight up Knight for Jennings trade, and Knight's super turnover prone. Sure, Jennings is immature, but he's still an upgrade over what we had before. It's like Joe D's brain is finally working again\"</a></p>\n<p>Well uh, he was right about Kravstov I guess?</p>\n<p><strong>NEXT UP</strong></p>\n<p>The next players I'll be doing (in order of appearance according to requests) are Jokic, Draymond, Steph, Gobert and then finally a brief compilation of meme/fan favourite players like Caruso and Tacko.</p>\n<p>Any other suggestions/feedback are welcome!</p>",

There have been reports in recent weeks that Houston has interest in trading up with Detroit to take Cunningham, but the vast majority of speculation from other teams has centered on Green as the presumptive fit at No. 2. His ability to create his own shot gives him a chance to be a legitimate offensive fulcrum, and the Rockets are positioned to take a swing on upside. For what it\u2019s worth, Green\u2019s camp is thought to prefer Houston as a destination, rather than landing in Cleveland one pick later. Devin Booker\u2019s evolution from promising scorer into a well-rounded perimeter centerpiece provides a blueprint for Green\u2019s development, with his exceptional athleticism giving him major upside.</p>\n</blockquote>",
