Daigneualt has a new starting lineup playing every other game. And yet, I feel this is the best Thunder team since 2016! Our defense is able to flip a switch and play some of the best defense I've seen in recent memory. The Thunder THRIVE in the chaos they create, and it truly does not matter who is on the court right now - they will create deflections and turnovers and make you play to their pace.   |\n2   |   <a href=\"/BOS\"></a> Celtics    |   -1  |   -   |   What an absolute week and a half for Payton Pritchard. Shooting 46.9% from deep, and that's including the first game of the season where he went 1-9. Since that game he's shot nearly 50% from deep, including 4 games where he shot 50% or better from three. Not to be outdone, Neemias Queta, the first Portuguese player in the NBA, has established himself as a legitimate plug and play backup big man. After years of seemingly being a backup big man short of perfection, it seems like the Celtics now have an abundance of them with Luke Kornet, Neemias Queta, and Xavier Tillman. The Celtics took care of business to start the season, with their only loss being in overtime against the Pacers in a game that they should've lost by 15 or 20 in regulation. Between now and the next power rankings the Celtics have 7 games with matchups against the Hawks and Nets both twice, the Warriors, Bucks, and Raptors.    |\n3   |   <a href=\"/CLE\"></a> Cavaliers  |   +7  |   -   |   You should get to know these Cavs, as this core is locked up through 2027, when we will again have a decent sized chest of picks to deal. With the resurgence of Darius Garland and the improvements in Evan Mobley\u2019s game, and Atkinson staggering minutes, we\u2019re now getting all 48 minutes with an all star level pick and roll attack. As Atkinson figures out his favorite lineups, no one on the team has averaged more than 29 mpg, and any 3 of Wade, Merrill, LeVert, Okoro, Niang and Jerome are getting run with Atkinson\u2019s favorite pairings of Mitchell/Mobley and Garland/Allen. Our second most used 5 man combination, after our starting lineup, is Mitchell/Merrill/LeVert/Niang/Mobley, and they\u2019re netting +45.8 points per 100 possessions so far on the year. While that rate is unsustainable, everything we\u2019ve seen so far is summed up simply with Kenny Atkinson\u2019s stated plan for the team: keep the defensive identity, but revamp the offense to ask more of the role players. So far, it\u2019s undeniably working as we are rocking the #2 offensive rating and #5 defensive rating.  |\n4   |   <a href=\"/PHX\"></a> Suns   |   +5  |   -   |       |\n5   |   <a href=\"/GSW\"></a> Warriors   |   +12 |   -   |   Welcometothefuckingshow.gif On paper the Warriors depth looked better than last year but no one thought it would be this good. Warriors are winning games they would have lost last year and doing it without Steph even playing. Obviously expectations are tempered by the cake walk schedule, but a lot to be excited about with the Water Buddies, PodzGod, and DPOYmond really gelling. Even Two Way Wiggs has made an appearance a couple of games. Not saying \"we gonna be schampionship\" but this start has more of a 21-22 or 22-23 feeling than 23-24.    |\n6   |   <a href=\"/NYK\"></a> Knicks |   -3  |   -   |   Imagine for a moment you are a Viennese citizen in 1808. Life is not so simple. The Napoleonic wars have ravaged Europe, Austria has declared itself an Empire, and there is economic and social instability as the population comes to terms with the end of the Classical age and the coming of the Baroque period. Mozart has been dead over a decade, and Haydn is on death's door. You decide to visit the <em>Theatre an der Wien</em> to escape the uncertainty. Ludwig van Beethoven, that half-deaf madman, is premiering his new Symphony. His Fifth Symphony, in fact. The lights are dim, the orchestra has tuned, and quiet sets. Those first four notes are played and you realize all at once you're witnessing an artistic revelation. The scales are the same, the instruments are the same, but never before have you heard them used in such a way. Genius at work; poetry in motion. This is how I feel watching the Knicks play defense. Make sure to vote.   |\n7   |   <a href=\"/DAL\"></a> Mavericks  |   -2  |   -   |   Luka Doncic has gotten off to a slow start after missing the entire preseason, but found rhythm Sunday night against Orlando, which hopes to give the Mavs some more fluid chemistry into the month. Klay Thompson looks the part of the top free agent signing for Dallas as a sniper, especially given how his shot diet changes the offense for everyone else around him. Everyone is playing defense in Dallas, including new acquisitions Quentin Grimes, Naji Marshall, and Klay Thompson, which has led to the Mavs having the number three defense in the NBA. The next two weeks' schedule will be a great litmus test on where Dallas truly belongs on power rankings.    |\n8   |   <a href=\"/LAL\"></a> Lakers |   +10 |   -   |   The Lakers' performance is pretty much the ceiling of their current roster with competent coaching: the tier of contenders outside looking in and can dominate games that fit their style of play. Conversely, when they play teams with perimeter athleticism, their weaknesses are severely exposed, allowing them to exploit their poor transition defense and lack of size and athleticism in the perimeter. The absence of Vando and Wood is a little overlooked as they would provide JJ some additional tools to salvage the poor contribution from the bench (dead last in scoring). Anthony Davis has stood out in the early season with averages of 31.8/12.0/2.8/2.0/1.8, while LeBron continues his All-NBA form. Lakers face a pretty favorable schedule for the next couple of weeks which hopefully allows the team to continue building good habits and welcome the guys sidelined back to the court gauge their potential. |\n9   |   <a href=\"/MEM\"></a> Grizzlies  |   +4  |   -   |   Well our injury woes continued in <em>checks notes</em> three games into the season with Desmond Bane and Marcus Smart bot having injuries sidelining them for a few weeks. Despite blowing multiple leads the team finds themselves over .500, but what we need more than anything is chemistry.  Rookies are looking incredibly solid with Edey doing a lot of the dirty work and Jalen Wells looking like a fantastic 3 &amp; D prospect.   |\n10  |   <a href=\"/MIN\"></a> TWolves    |   -4  |   -   |   This Wolves team is not the one you remember from last season. The defense is porous and struggles to end opponent possessions. Wolves need to find their footing fast because it will be a long season if they don't.  |\n11  |   <a href=\"/DEN\"></a> Nuggets    |   -7  |   -   |   While it's certainly too early to panic, the Nuggets' play so far has highlighted some glaring deficiencies with how this team is constructed. Russ has done nothing to beat the allegations of being wildly inefficient thus far, but the bench unit as a whole has struggled to provide any productivity for the 1..2..3..5th year in a row? On the bright side, the starters have looked phenomenal since dropping the first two games of the season, and they managed to come out of two straight sets of back-to-backs with a 3-1 record.  |\n12  |   <a href=\"/MIA\"></a> Heat   |   +4  |   -   |   Started off the season good enough and not much to complain about yet. As expected, the team is a little top heavy in terms of scoring but should be good defensively this season. Our biggest issue will be if/when injuries hit the starting line up because our bench is pretty shallow. We might as well enjoy being full health until that happens though.     |\n13  |   <a href=\"/SAC\"></a> Kings  |   +1  |   -   |   The Kings are definitely feeling those early-season growing pains. De'Aaron Fox is such a dynamic scorer, and while he's got a decent jumper, his elite speed and finishing ability are what set him apart. Like you said, when his shots aren\u2019t falling, it can really sting in a close game like the OT loss to Toronto. Attacking the rim could be the better approach, especially since it opens up more kick-outs and high-percentage looks for teammates. Plus, getting to the line can keep the offense flowing and keep defenses honest. Their shooting as a whole has been hit-or-miss, but once they get a rhythm and players like Keegan Murray and Kevin Huerter start finding consistency from deep, things should balance out. If Fox goes into attack mode, it might shift the pressure off their shooting, giving them a chance to settle in. Here's hoping they can find that early groove soon!   |\n14  |   <a href=\"/HOU\"></a> Rockets    |   +5  |   -   |   Jalen Green's March Madness continues as he has taken over this team for the start of the season. That being said, Sengun has been inconsistent at best (especially in scoring), and FVV seems over the hill. Udoka will be reflecting on how bad of a \"fit\" Harden could have been for his system when he had the choice.  |\n15  |   <a href=\"/ORL\"></a> Magic  |   -3  |   -   |   Life is pain. Basketball is pain.   |\n16  |   <a href=\"/SAS\"></a> Spurs  |   +4  |   -   |   It's been a promising start to the year. The Spurs have taken some bona fide contenders and <em>not</em> been absolutely embarrassed off the floor (though make no mistake, were thoroughly outclassed), split games with the Rockets, and have won B2B games against the Jazz and Timberwolves. Wemby's offensive game has been mostly dormant to start the season, and while a growing number of fans seem frustrated with his 3PT volume, <a href=\"https://x.com/SpursReporter/status/1852202897989083346\">Pop (a man who famously once said he wishes the NBA would abolish the 3 point line again) has encouraged him to keep letting them fly to develop that part of his game</a> The standout performer for the start of the season has been Jeremy Sochan, who seems to be benefitting tremendously from CP3's presence and is fulfilling his potential as an offensive slasher/defensive menace to the tune of 17.3/8.5 averages. The Spurs fanbase seems to be oscillating significantly between doom &amp; gloom (after the Rockets/Thunder losses) to \"we are so fucking back\" (after the Jazz/Timberwolves wins) and my big take: try not to get carried away in either direction. Convincing yourself the Spurs are hopeless and that Wemby's gonna force his way out sounds miserable while convincing yourself that we're destined for 45+ wins and a playoff spot is just setting yourself up for disappointment; enjoy the ride. The Spurs have an interesting stretch in the schedule coming up with an opportunity to really establish who they're gonna be this season, @LAC, @HOU, POR, UTA, SAC, WAS, LAL, @DAL coming up. (PS: Late breaking news, but it looks like Pop is out indefinitely with an undisclosed illness that first popped up on Saturday. Hoping he has a swift recover and that everything\u2019s okay!)    |\n17  |   <a href=\"/CHI\"></a> Bulls  |   +6  |   -   |       |\n18  |   <a href=\"/IND\"></a> Pacers |   -7  |   -   |   It has been an ugly start to the season for Indiana, especially considering the expectations. After a tough opening win against Detroit, Indiana proceeded to get waxed by New York, and squander wins away against Philadelphia, Orlando, and New Orleans. The anti-clutch illness has persisted with this team ever since they contracted it in the postseason, and All-NBA point guard Tyrese Haliburton looks like a shell of his former self. And to top it all off, Indiana lost BOTH of its backup centers to Achilles injuries. |\n19  |   <a href=\"/NOP\"></a> Pelicans   |   -4  |   -   |   Well, for one game it was really nice to see us have a real point guard. His shooting wasn't great, but to see Dejounte Murray actually execute the offense, run a pick-and-roll, and manage the game in the clutch was refreshing. He finished his first game with 14/8/10 in 30 minutes. And then not 30 minutes after the game was over did we learn he suffered a left hand fracture and will be out for 4-6 weeks. By game four All-Defensive wonder Herb Jones suffered a right shoulder tear to sideline him for 2-4 weeks and veteran presence CJ McCollum suffered a right groin strain to sideline him for 2-3 weeks. Trey Murphy has yet to be cleared for contact this season with his hamstring injury. Zion's revenge tour is on hold for as long as he is shooting his body fat percentage. The good news? Rookie center Yves Missi is showing promise and expected to climb the rookie ladder in a week class. Second year player Jordan Hawkins has improved his defense enough such that he can really show off his scoring prowess. As always, its the hope that kills you. And the Pelicans are looking dead on arrival in what is surely a make or break season for this core.     |\n20  |   <a href=\"/LAC\"></a> Clippers   |   +2  |   -   |   The Intuit Dome era begins with a 0-4 home start, with all games sans the OKC one being heartbreakers. Despite this, there are some good things to come from the Clippers' start to the season. For starters, Ivica Zubac has taken the slight offensive leap I hoped he would, scoring 20+ points in 4/6 games in this stretch, while currently being tied with Saboner for most rebounds per game. Norman \"Addition by Subtraction\" Powell has been on a heater as the starting 2 (25 PPG on 51/42/85 splits), while both Derrick Jones Jr. and Kris Dunn have been absolute DEMONS on-ball and in the passing lanes. All of this shined through in our 2 road wins against Denver and Golden State, while all of our losses, on the other hand, have showcased our biggest flaw: the offense is quite shit. High-usage Harden is back, but his shot has been off to start the season, and him routinely being gassed by the 4th quarter has cost us some games already. The Kevin Porter Jr. minutes have pretty much been the Westbrook minutes 2.0 (both of them even dressed as The Joker for Halloween), while both Terance Mann and Amir Coffey look routinely lost on offense as the fanbase increasingly clamors for rookie/preseason standout Jordan Miller to get some run in lieu of them. With Kawhi still out (I genuinely think no one has a clue when he will be back), we still look like a pesky .500 team at our best as we continue our search for an offensive spark off the bench.   |\n21  |   <a href=\"/ATL\"></a> Hawks  |   --  |   -   |   Hawks fans have been successfully talked off of the ledge with Dyson's return. While two losses to Washington are rough, whenever this team has Trae, Dyson, and Jalen they've looked pretty good. Hopefully that will continue over the next couple weeks as the rest of our perimeter rotation gets healthy.  |\n22  |   <a href=\"/BKN\"></a> Nets   |   +7  |   -   |   The Nets have come out with some life this year, they aren't a good team by any means but they play hard basketball and are looking like a modern offense with head coach Jordi Fernandez. This may have something to do with hot starts from Schroder and Cam Thomas - I expect the team to cool off as the season goes on but it has been exciting watching the development of young players. |\n23  |   <a href=\"/MIL\"></a> Bucks  |   -16 |   -   |   The first two weeks have been a nightmarish start for the bucks. Hopefully things improve and Khris comes back soon, otherwise this is a play-in team.  |\n24  |   <a href=\"/PHI\"></a> 76ers  |   -16 |   -   |   Oh boy. I don't think in my worst nightmares I could have drafted a worse start to the season. Positives for now? Yabusele looks really solid in his return to the NBA post-Olympics and Jared McCain looks like quite a good pick for the Sixers. Besides that, one word can be used to describe the Sixers\u2026 underperforming. I think everyone should be aware that all of these role players were made to complement Embiid/George and not play such heavy minutes on their own, but they also have been underperforming relative to the roles they've been given anyway. This is all not to even mention the ongoing saga of what is actually wrong with Embiid. Thankfully, Paul George should be making his return tonight, hopefully turning this clown show around soon. Oh, and one finger salutes to a certain Philadelphia reporter.  |\n25  |   <a href=\"/CHA\"></a> Hornets    |   +1  |   -   |   The Hornets started the season with a bang, winning an 18-point comeback in Houston led by the stupendous LaMelo Ball. Since then, all downhill - Brandon Miller got injured, now Nick Richards, leaving us with zero centers, and Mark Williams is still out indefinitely. I'm beginning to get Greg Oden vibes from him - back and foot injuries on a 7'1\" guy is terrifying. Still, we are nowhere near as hopeless as last year. Good news is that Lee is a great coach, pushing Mazzulla to the limit in the B2B against Boston, and LaMelo looks every bit the all star we knew he was in 21-22. He is by far the most entertaining player in the NBA and along with the amazingly shifty Tre Mann, a great reason to watch us. I can't move us much higher in power rankings, but in terms of league pass rankings, this team is infinitely better than under Clifford.      |\n26  |   <a href=\"/TOR\"></a> Raptors    |   -2  |   -   |   It's been a fun rollercoaster. A few close games thrown but great for development. However there are many bright spots so far with Dick leading the way, and RJ being star-J so far.    |\n27  |   <a href=\"/DET\"></a> Pistons    |   --  |   -   |   Turnovers are the story of the season. Through seven games we have +43 turnovers compared to our competition. The only game we had less turnovers to date was vs the Pacers. I appreciate Cade as much as anyone, but I think the experiment with him at PG has reached the point where it is a failure. We should really try to move him to the 3 as he is averaging 5.1 TO per game. He just can't protect the ball. At this point in his career I don't think that's something you can just turn the lightswitch on and fix. Don't get me wrong, he's a good player, but he's playing out of position for his skillset   |\n28  |   <a href=\"/WAS\"></a> Wizards    |   +2  |   -   |   This is a complicated task because on one hand, you want to highlight how impressive of a start this has been for the Wizards' young talent but also temper expectations given this is a bad basketball team. Back-to-back wins against the ailing Atlanta Hawks inspired confidence and a high that fans aren't necessarily coming down from -- even the Heat comfortably winning the game in Mexico City. And while not trying to sound like a senile, old man, calling the cops on kids who are having fun in the street, there also needs to be this expectation setting when it comes to the Wizards. Alex Sarr has become a legitimate candidate for Rooke of the Year but also the concern of if he can consistently produce on the offensive end. Bub Carrington has been great to start the season but really can't be a point guard and is best suited coming off the bench as a combo guard. Kyshawn George is a great 3-and-D threat but also has a much lower ceiling compared to his other two counterparts. And the \"Bilal Coulibaly leap\" feels somewhat similar to the recent propaganda pushes that come to young Washington Wizards' forwards, calling for more utilization when better suited as foils. Don't get me wrong, this season has been a fun start and optimism for the future is certainly there. And the pain I would feel if Coulibaly ever wears another jersey is palpable. But there is still so much wrong to the franchise -- the coaching, the lack of a point guard and just how bad their halfcourt offense is. It has been nice to find out that the Wizards' won't be an embarrassment for 48 minutes every night. But averaging -20 deficits in losses this season still is great.  |\n29  |   <a href=\"/POR\"></a> Trail Blazers  |   -1  |   -   |   Portland is playing shockingly well early, propelled mostly by their defense. The stats don't back it up yet, but that's mostly because their third quarters have been historically bad. That sort of inconsistency is expected of a young team, but they've been competitive in all their games so far. On the down side, the offense has been concerning across the board. Even though the team isn't stocked with shooters, you should expect some regression to the mean.   |\n30  |   <a href=\"/UTA\"></a> Jazz   |   -5  |   -   |   We literally had the worst 5 game stretch in franchise history with a -110 point differential our last 5 games. We might be one of the worst teams in the last decade. Taylor Hendricks snapped his leg in half, while Lauri Markkanen and Jordan Clarkson have already missed multiple games. There is hardly any good. Our rookies and second year players all look bad, we don't have a good facilitator, and let Keyonte George take an exuberant amount of 3's. The tank is on! TANK NOTE. PLANT THE FLAGG!    |</p>",

That\u2019s so much cooler than just blasting somebody. Thanks to my fans and my new sponsors at [sword and knife retailer] Cold Steel for helping me turn this corner in my life.\u201d At press time, Morant had received a 25-game suspension after an Instagram video showed him intoxicated and performing the forbidden Whirlwind Slash technique outside a Salt Lake City nightclub.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>https://theonion.com/reformed-ja-morant-more-into-swords-now/</p>",

No pressure. We\u2019re all going to be dead soon, and it really doesn\u2019t matter anymore</strong>. So, zero pressure. You\u2019re either going to win or you\u2019re not. And <strong>when you win, you try to forget about it a week later, and when you lose, you try to forget about it a week later.</strong> It\u2019s not pressure. It\u2019s an opportunity. We have an opportunity here for the next few years, however long we\u2019re together \u2014 I\u2019ve said this in the past \u2014 we have an opportunity to carry the organization forward, to double down on the tradition and the history of what this organization has.</p>\n<p>And what else would you expect than somebody expecting you to win all the time? I wouldn\u2019t want someone expecting me to lose all the time. That would be debilitating. So we have an expectation to win. We have great character, great talent, and we just have to work to maximize that and try to rely on the players to do that</p>\n<p>I just don\u2019t look at it as pressure. <strong>A Boston media member or somebody expecting me to win, they don\u2019t have a weapon. They\u2019re not going to come after me if I don\u2019t win.</strong> It\u2019s just people saying words, and they don\u2019t mean anything. They\u2019re just words. You\u2019re just saying them because you have to say them. <strong>You\u2019re contractually obligated to write a 500-word article afterward. They\u2019re just words. You can\u2019t do anything.</strong></p>\n<p>So it\u2019s just a made-up word. We don\u2019t have a pressure. <strong>If we lose, we\u2019re not losing our life. We\u2019re not surgeons. We\u2019re not in the military. We coach basketball for a living</strong>. No one\u2019s putting more pressure and \u2018expectations\u2019 than we are on ourselves. We have a responsibility. \u2026 I ask guys all the time: <strong>Would you rather have someone expect you to lose or win?</strong></p>\n<p>If you came up here and were like, \u2018Man, I really expected you to lose that game,\u2019 I would be pissed. But if you come up here and are like, \u2018You should have won that game,\u2019 it\u2019s like, yeah, that\u2019s what we signed up for. So I think it\u2019s just the perspective of how you look at it and the truth of it.</p>\n<p>If you allow words to take your personal power, then yes. So I don\u2019t allow words to take my personal power. That\u2019s just important. Words don\u2019t have \u2014 they only have power if you allow them to. <strong>That\u2019s what I try to teach my kids, like, I don\u2019t give a shit what someone says to me. Did you allow that to have an impact on you?</strong> He didn\u2019t put his hands on you, he didn\u2019t touch you, he didn\u2019t do anything. He said something to you. So now you have a choice to decide how you\u2019re going to interpret that.</p>\n<p>So, it\u2019s not pressure. There\u2019s nothing anyone in this (press conference) circle can do to me that\u2019s going to impact my identity and who I am as a person and a coach. <strong>We\u2019re either going to win or we\u2019re not, and 40 years from now, none of you are invited to my funeral, and that\u2019s it. That\u2019s it.</strong></p>\n<p>Tweet: <a href=\"https://x.com/zm_cox/status/1848411360599633974\">https://x.com/zm_cox/status/1848411360599633974</a></p>\n<p>Full Quote: <a href=\"https://www.bostonherald.com/2024/10/21/joe-mazzulla-not-feeling-celtics-pressure-because-were-all-going-to-be-dead-soon/\">https://www.bostonherald.com/2024/10/21/joe-mazzulla-not-feeling-celtics-pressure-because-were-all-going-to-be-dead-soon/</a></p>",
