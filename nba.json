            "content_text": "[Source](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ted-lasso-nba-coaches-11626232223)\n\n>Utah Jazz coach Quin Snyder needed some help dealing with a tricky situation at work not long ago. He took advice from one of his favorite television shows. \n\n>\u201cI don\u2019t know if you watch \u2018Ted Lasso,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cBut sometimes your favorite animal is a goldfish because it has a memory of 10 seconds. That\u2019s where we need to be.\u201d \n\n\n>There was something curious about one of the NBA\u2019s brightest minds borrowing a Ted Lasso pep talk. He could have leaned on decades of experience to get his basketball team past a stressful moment in the playoffs. He decided to invoke the folksy wisdom of a fictional American football coach managing an English soccer club. \n\n>It turns out he\u2019s not the only person in professional sports channeling his inner Ted Lasso these days.\n\n>\u201cIt should be required watching for coaches,\u201d Snyder said. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n>The model for modern coaches evolving from Lombardi to Lasso is a reflection of the shifting power dynamics in sports and how much has changed in management strategies over the past decade. Not every coach is relentlessly cheerful or comes to the office with freshly baked cookies for his boss. But it\u2019s hard to look around the business world and not see hints of Jason Sudeikis\u2019s character. \n\n>\u201cI think it used to be an accepted leadership tactic to essentially abuse people,\u201d said Brendan Hunt, one of the show\u2019s creators and writers who also plays Coach Beard, Lasso\u2019s sidekick. \u201cI\u2019m sure there are people who are, like, Now we\u2019re soft. We\u2019re not soft. We\u2019re just not morons. We see better ways to get the best out of people. Humiliating them in front of their peers is probably not high on the list.\u201d \n\n>Tyranny is out. Empathy is in. Coaches are getting the most of players by relating to them, not dictating to them, while keeping them accountable without coddling them. They are behaving more like Ted Lasso. \n\n>There is a takeaway from the series, now in its second season on Apple TV+, that applies to any line of work: The best coaches are the best managers of people.\n\n>It doesn\u2019t matter that Lasso doesn\u2019t know anything about the sport. What happens on the pitch is the least demanding part of his job. He soothes the neuroses of his star players. He injects his role players with confidence. He uses his superpower of emotional intelligence to balance competing personalities, foster an environment where everyone is capable of good work and build the culture of a team initially resistant to his charms. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n>The show found an early supporter in someone else who believes that winning should be fun, Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr, who tweeted his praise for the series when most people were ready to dismiss it. He also has another reason to be a fan: One of his children happens to work at \u201cTed Lasso.\u201d\n\n>\u201cIf there is a lesson on the show, it is that culture beats scheme,\u201d Kerr said in an email. \u201cThe guy knows nothing about soccer but he has created a great atmosphere with the club that leads to winning.\u201d \n\n>Chris Paul was binging the show between film sessions as the overachieving Phoenix Suns made the NBA Finals. Meanwhile his coach sounded like he was interviewing for Lasso\u2019s staff as he discussed the bond he\u2019s developed with his players. \u201cWhen they make fun of me,\u201d Monty Williams said, \u201cthat\u2019s a sign that we\u2019re tight.\u201d \n\nI'm glad to see Ted has fans in the NBA",

Especially impressive watching Holiday in [slow motion](https://streamable.com/vhp207) time his strip to make sure he starts with ball and makes it clean. Many players would not have the discipline to time it properly and would have reached early and committed a foul.\n\n>Holiday (MIL) strips the ball from Booker (PHX). As Booker turns to expose the ball, there is incidental contact to his arm during the steal, which is not what dislodges the ball. ([Video](http://official.nba.com/last-two-minute-report/?gameNo=0042000405&eventNum=2334))\n\nAlso notable is that they deemed Booker's [reach on Middleton at 1:47.9](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/omisnu/highlight_middleton_fouled_by_booker_with_under_2/) an incorrect non-call, which was basically the [same play he did](https://youtu.be/ZUVtWZPmQvQ?t=29) on Holiday at the end of Game 4 (I have seen arguments about that not being a foul either due to it occurring in the low block). Both should have been fouls.\n\n>Booker (PHX) places a hand to Middleton's (MIL) opposite hip on his drive and affects his SQBR before he is able to reach and dislodge the ball. [(Video)](http://official.nba.com/last-two-minute-report/?gameNo=0042000405&eventNum=2325)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn my opinion the officiating in this series has been pretty rough, though Game 5 was *mostly* good. I'm just happy that so far, bad calls have not affected the outcome of the games (at least how I think what the outcome should be).",
