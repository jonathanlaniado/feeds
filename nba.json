He had a handle and could pass but was very very unrefined. Embiid was trained under American AAU training and had just started playing basketball when he came to america yet is never used as an example of American training.

So I expect the whole you know what debate to ensue, but let\u2019s just try to appreciate some of these numbers I\u2019ve observed.</p>\n<p>LeBron will play into the 2024-2025 season. There is no doubt about it. If there is any slither of a chance that LeBron can play with his son Bronny in the NBA, he\u2019ll make it happen. This season is not being treated as a farewell parade, this is just another final chance at a championship with the Lakers.</p>\n<p>So with that made clear, LeBron will <em>almost certainly</em> break the 40,000 total career points mark, and will be on the court as a 40 year old in his 22nd NBA season.</p>\n<p>40,000 points, 40 years of life.</p>\n<p>If LeBron was drafted to the NBA out of the womb (stay with me), he would have averaged 1000 points per year for every year of his life. Over 82 games in a season, that\u2019s 12.2 points per game.</p>\n<p>It would take a newborn baby 40 years at 12.2 ppg to touch his record. How many NBA players have averaged over 12 points in their career? How many averaged over 12 points in a single season?</p>\n<p>I can\u2019t give you the exact number unfortunately, consider the average points per game for the average NBA player is around 9, 1 career year of LeBron\u2019s life would be worth <em>more</em> than at least 50% of the entire history of the NBA\u2019s player bases career. But I can put it into another perspective</p>\n<p>If you split LeBron\u2019s life into two 21 year stints in the NBA at 12.2 ppg, 82 games, he would have 2 careers with 21,000 total points.</p>\n<p>There have been 50 players in the history of the NBA to reach 20,000 total points over their career.</p>\n<p>LeBron reaches the top 50 all time points in 2 seperate lives.</p>\n<p>And while we play fantasy with these obviously absurd reaches, we need to remember that LeBron didn\u2019t play 82 games a year, nor did he / has he played for 40 years in the NBA</p>\n<p>He will play 22 seasons. Averaging no less than the 20.9 ppg in his rookie season. The fastest to reach every single 1000 point milestone for his time.</p>\n<p>Oh, and he\u2019ll do this all while also finishing with well over 10,000 rebounds AND assists. That\u2019s a 40 point triple double\u2026 x1000.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s appreciate greatness while we still can.</p></div>",

It\u2019s a stance that Irving has explained to close teammates. To him, this is about a grander fight than the one on the court and Irving is challenging a perceived control of society and people\u2019s livelihood, according to sources with knowledge of Irving\u2019s mindset. It is a decision that he believes he is capable to make given his current life dynamics. \u201cKyrie wants to be a voice for the voiceless,\u201d one source said.</p>\n<p>However, the nation\u2019s top doctors and science have cleared the vaccine as safe and effective. The Center for Disease Control (CDC), American Medical Association (AMA) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) state clearly that COVID-19 vaccines are effective at helping protect against severe disease and death, including from variants of the virus, while also being safe. In fact, multiple studies showed that 99 percent of people who are in intensive care units in hospitals are unvaccinated. Sources say 96 percent of NBA players are currently vaccinated. More than 3.75 billion people worldwide have received a vaccine dose. <strong>To be clear, Irving\u2019s stance is not believed to be anti-science, according to sources.</strong></p>\n<p>Rival teams believe the Nets would be open to a significant trade offer for Irving, but his openness to playing for other franchises is unclear. Irving will be fully eligible in all markets except New York City and San Francisco. Brooklyn is on a championship chase, wanting the commitment of every player on their roster, now dealing with the cloud of uncertainty regarding a member of its big three.</p>\n</blockquote></div>",

I hate that I can\u2019t take my daughter to the zoo because everyone wants to talk basketball or take a photo. To my daughter, I\u2019m just her dad, she doesn\u2019t know any different. I hate that I can\u2019t take her to the park because there are kids who are out playing basketball and [they say], \u201cHey, let\u2019s go play.\u201d I love you kids, but I literally just want to be a dad right now. A lot of times I just try to do a lot of things with her around the house, or I\u2019ll get on my bike and put her on the back of it, stuff like that, where it can just be us.</p>\n<p>What\u2019s changed since I\u2019ve become a dad is I\u2019m always thinking, How can I be better for my child? </p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>What\u2019s the best style advice you\u2019ve received, or a style rule or trick you rely on?</strong></p>\n<p>The best I\u2019ve ever heard is from, his name\u2019s Keith, he\u2019s one of my stylist\u2019s assistants, and he said, \u201cJimmy, you can wear whatever you want to wear. Just be you when you wear it.\u201d I was like, Yep! Nobody tell me anything, I can wear whatever I want. [It] made Khalilah, my stylist, so mad. </p>\n<p>I take that in all aspects of my life. I\u2019m going to be me and encourage everyone else: Be you. Be yourself. You\u2019re the only one who knows how to do it. You can do it at a high level.</p>\n<p><strong>What have you been reading and watching lately?</strong></p>\n<p>We\u2019ve been watching a lot of TV shows. If I\u2019m being brutally honest, my daughter takes over the TV more often than not. What she\u2019ll do is, in the middle while you\u2019ll be watching TV and she wants to dance, she\u2019ll make you change the TV and put on music so she can do that. I guess it\u2019s the same type of entertainment, because it\u2019s just so funny to watch her do her thing. And you have to watch whatever she wants to watch. Spirit, the movie about the wild horse, had me researching where I can go see wild horses. They\u2019re in Oregon, Nevada, southern Arizona, Washington state. Maybe one of these days I\u2019ll be able to take her in the wild and see some horses.</p>\n</blockquote></div>",
