It\u2019s your turn to do what needs to be done. . . . But if you don\u2019t get me the money tomorrow we are all f\u2026ed. Get me the money. Your turn to figure it out like I have for so long.

The whole thing is surprisingly understandable to a layperson</p>\n<p>The quote pre-dates known interactions with Ballmer/Clippers/Kawhi so it's not directly related to the NBA story in that way, but it is a look behind the curtain at the company at the center of this. They were always running out of money and the co-founders were not on good terms. Less than a year later, they had seemingly saved the company and were happily posing for photo-ops with Steve Ballmer celebrating the Clippers partnership and large investment. </p>\n<p>The rest of the complaint does reference events and figures more directly related to the NBA story. There is an \"Investor 1\" that is likely Ballmer and some documented correspondence between his chief investment officer and Sanberg that's interesting to read. It also lays out when the company's accounting firm resigned over fraud concerns and concerns the company's CFO had throughout.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>Source: https://www.commondreams.org/opinion/media-billionaires</p>\n<p><strong>Ballmer\u2019s career at Microsoft is often painted as the story of a bold leader guiding a tech giant through the new millennium. In reality, it was a case study in how to crush rivals and protect a monopoly. Under his watch, Microsoft racked up record fines from regulators; perfected its notorious strategy of \u201cembrace, extend, extinguish;\u201d and enforced a cutthroat internal culture that stifled collaboration. This wasn\u2019t innovation. It was domination dressed up as genius.</strong></p>\n<p>When Ballmer became Microsoft\u2019s CEO in 2000, the company was already facing a bruising US antitrust case over its efforts to crush competitors like Netscape and RealNetworks. European regulators soon followed, hitting Microsoft with record fines for abusing its monopoly. The Commission found that Microsoft had deliberately abused its dominant position by tying Windows Media Player to its operating system and undermining competition in server software.</p>\n<p>At the center of these cases was a clear pattern: Microsoft used its dominance not to compete fairly but to block competitors, extend its monopoly, and extract rents from consumers and developers.</p>\n<p><strong>Internally, Ballmer presided over the now-notorious \u201cstack ranking\u201d system, in which managers were forced to rank employees against each other, ensuring that some were always labeled failures regardless of performance. Vanity Fair reported that this system was described by employees as \u201cthe most destructive process inside of Microsoft.\u201d It encouraged backstabbing, punished collaboration, and destroyed morale.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Yet Ballmer\u2019s reputation in the business press was rarely tarnished. Microsoft\u2019s aggressive tactics and toxic culture were downplayed as part of the \u201crough and tumble\u201d of the tech industry. Instead of being recognized as symptoms of a deeply flawed corporate ethos, they were cast as evidence of toughness, discipline, or even strategic brilliance.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Ballmer\u2019s career is a perfect case in point. Few in the press asked whether Microsoft\u2019s dominance strangled innovation or whether his leadership undermined workers and consumers. Instead, the coverage painted him as a colorful eccentric, a lovable billionaire, and above all a success story\u2014as if his rise were earned brilliance rather than brute monopoly power.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Pablo Torre\u2019s remarkable reporting on the Aspiration scandal is a reminder of what real journalism can do when it asks hard questions instead of recycling corporate talking points. His work not only exposes the hidden machinery of sports business but also shows why we need the same relentless scrutiny of CEOs and executives across industries. If journalism is to serve the public, it must puncture the myths of genius and demand accountability from those who profit most from monopoly and exploitation.</strong></p>\n<p>The NBA investigation may or may not conclude that Ballmer violated the rules. But the larger scandal here is not limited to basketball. It is about how our culture treats men like Ballmer as role models\u2014how we conflate wealth with competence, market share with innovation, and ruthless opportunism with genius.</p>\n<p>The real lesson of this scandal is that we must break the spell of billionaire mythology. Ballmer is not a singular villain; he is an emblem of an age in which billionaires are lauded as saviors while their empires rest on monopoly, exploitation, and illusion. The media has played a crucial role in maintaining this fa\u00e7ade, selling the public a narrative of \u201cgenius\u201d to justify inequality.</p>\n<p>A more honest narrative would recognize that the wealth of men like Ballmer was built on systems of exclusion, not innovation. It would expose the ways that corporate culture, whether in Big Tech or in the world of \u201cethical finance,\u201d uses the language of progress to mask exploitation. And it would challenge the very legitimacy of an economy in which billionaires can fail upward, celebrated as geniuses even as their companies and investments leave wreckage behind.</p>",

According to those sources, who were granted anonymity in order to speak freely about the negotiations, Robertson\u2019s list was long, and absurd. It included a trade for George, which featured an exorbitant price tag. It included a slice of ownership of the Toronto Maple Leafs, which Robertson was told was impossible.</p>\n<p>But two details stand out, in retrospect. One, Robertson asked for ownership stakes in outside companies: not just the Leafs, which he seemed to believe was separate, but with other companies with whom MLSE had a relationship. And two, the Raptors were told they needed to match at least $10 million per year in extra sponsorship income. Teams are allowed to introduce players to team sponsors; teams cannot negotiate deals, and MLSE was aware of that fact.</p>\n<p>But it didn\u2019t end there. As one source put it, when told about all the corporate sponsors in Toronto who would be happy to have Leonard as a pitchman, his camp said, \u201cWe don\u2019t want to do anything.\u201d Raptors representatives said any sponsor would want to shoot ads or arrange appearances; Robertson reiterated Leonard didn\u2019t want to do anything for the money.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s when the Raptors realized Leonard wasn\u2019t asking to be introduced to Toronto\u2019s lucrative corporate community; they were being asked to arrange no-show jobs, and arrange no-investment investments. MLSE rejected both proposals.</p>",

I\u2019ve spent my 15 year career knowing that one day I would have to walk away, and yet actually saying goodbye to basketball today has been the hardest decision I\u2019ve ever made.</p>\n<p>It's been the honor of a lifetime to compete against the fiercest competitors under the brightest lights and to challenge what the world thought was possible for someone who looks like me. I've lived out my wildest childhood dreams to play in front of fans all around the world. I will forever be the kid who felt fully alive everytime I touched a basketball.</p>\n<p>So many people have sacrificed and poured into my journey, more than I could ever repay. Thank you all for believing in me, for walking with me, for celebrating my highs and picking me up in my lows. This is a ride I never wanted to end but I know it\u2019s time. I will forever miss playing basketball in front of you all but our time will go beyond just playing. Here\u2019s to what\u2019s ahead.</p>\n<p>Love you all \u2764\ufe0f</p>",

The point guard has clear expectations for the European Championship. \"We will win the title.

They also noted that Bryant's team immediately contacted authorities after receiving the letter.</p>\n<p>Per\u00a0Scott Schwebke\u00a0of the\u00a0Orange County Register, an undercover Los Angeles County detective spoke twice with Graber, who admitted to the murder-for-hire scheme and said he would \"execute Bryant\u2019s accuser leaving no evidence.\"</p>\n<p>In the meantime, officials also traveled to the woman's residence in Colorado to make her aware of the threat.</p>\n<p>Los Angeles County sheriff\u2019s deputies and FBI agents arrested Graber on Sept. 18, 2003 as part of a setup to collect the first $1 million, according to Schwebke.</p>\n<p>The bodybuilder reached into a car for a bag of\u00a0movie studio prop money before 30 officers surrounded him in an El Segundo, California supermarket parking lot and arrested him.</p>\n<p>The Swiss national, who was 31 years old when he sent the letter,\u00a0pleaded no contest to grand theft in 2004, per Schwebke. Prosecutors dropped other charges, including solicitation to commit murder.</p>\n<p>Graber was sentenced to three years in prison, and he was ordered to be deported upon his release.</p>\n<p>Bryant was arrested\u00a0in 2003 after a 19-year-old woman said he raped her at the Vail, Colorado, hotel where the Lakers star was staying prior to a scheduled knee surgery. He said the sexual encounter with the woman, who worked at the hotel, was consensual.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The criminal case was dropped after the woman decided not to testify. She and Bryant later settled out of court in a civil suit she filed against him.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10012061-patrick-graber-allegedly-offered-to-kill-kobe-bryants-rape-accuser-for-3m-in-2003\">Article</a></p>",

Just for context, James Harden makes $36M per year and was just All-NBA and helped lead the Clippers to 50 wins with Kawhi Leonard only playing in 37 games (half of those while he was on a minutes restriction). Could Reaves have done that? I\u2019m not so sure.</p>\n<p>Outside of his first playoff series in the 2022-23 season, Reaves has seen a significant drop statistically from his regular season averages. In the playoffs for the 2023-24 season and the 2024-25 season he was a cumulative -46 in his minutes on the court. </p>",
