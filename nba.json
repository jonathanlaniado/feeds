The Hawks made a detour there for the NBA Cup, where they advanced to the semifinals, and Lester Jones, the team\u2019s senior vice president of financial planning and analysis, wanted the bill paid. A team accountant obliged.</p>\n<p>But there was no stay at the Wynn, according to federal prosecutors, and no bill for it.

            "content_html": "<p>How big of a problem is the Clippers controversy for the NBA?</p>\n<p>If you ask Pablo Torre, who first broke the story of Kawhi Leonard\u2019s $28 million \u201cno-show\u201d endorsement deal with green-banking company Aspiration about a month ago on his podcast Pablo Torre Finds Out, it\u2019s \u201cthe defining scandal of Adam Silver\u2019s tenure as commissioner.\u201d </p>\n<p>If you ask Mark Cuban, it\u2019s no problem at all. \u201cI don\u2019t think the Clippers did anything wrong,\u201d he told Front Office Sports on Thursday over email. \u201cSo zero problem.\u201d </p>\n<p>Torre has certainly uncovered compelling evidence that raises many questions. Why did Clippers owner Steve Ballmer continue putting money in Aspiration\u2014and also in the personal charity of cofounder Joe Sanberg\u2014even after news broke that Aspiration was under investigation by the feds? Why did his Clippers co-owner Dennis Wong invest in it, too? In what world is a $28 million player endorsement deal involving no ads or appearances normal? </p>\n<p>The NBA has initiated an investigation to attempt to answer these questions. Such investigations take months, not weeks, and the league knows the public\u2019s attention span is short. Here\u2019s an easy prediction: This one won\u2019t end with the NBA making Ballmer sell the team like the Donald Sterling investigation did. Depending on what the league finds, it could yield anything from a major to a minor punishment to nothing at all. The NBA could conclude it buys Ballmer\u2019s thin explanation that Aspiration \u201cconned me.\u201d</p>\n<p>I\u2019m more interested in how a little-known carbon-credits fintech company secured a $300 million deal as an official \u201cfounding sponsor\u201d of an NBA team\u2014a price and designation that required NBA approval.</p>\n<p>The situation reminds me very much of FTX, the fraudulent crypto exchange that launched in 2019, surged to a $32 billion valuation by early 2022, and collapsed by the end of that same year. Along the way, FTX cozied up to Tom Brady and Gisele B\u00fcndchen, plus a slew of athlete endorsers. (Aspiration had Drake and Leo DiCaprio.) In March 2021, FTX entered a 19-year, $135 million stadium naming rights deal with the Miami Heat. </p>\n<p>Why did the Heat, NBA, and city of Miami trust that a company that had existed for less than two years would be around for 19 years? In an interview with FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried\u2014now serving a 25-year sentence in a California prison\u2014in May 2021, I asked him that. He smiled and said, \u201cIt\u2019s been a pretty good year for us. To the point where, frankly, we don\u2019t need to rely on the other 18 years to have the funds for this.\u201d By January 2023, the company was dead and its logo stripped from the Heat arena.</p>\n<p>I asked Silver about the league\u2019s approval process for team sponsors onstage at our Tuned In summit in New York on Sept. 16. \u201cThis was not something that was on our radar to even be thinking about,\u201d he responded. \u201cWhen this concludes, we\u2019ll take a fresh look at our rules in terms of companies that players are investing in, and owners.\u201d</p>\n<p>But then he argued that the NBA can\u2019t fully look into every team sponsor. </p>\n<p>\u201cThere are literally thousands of deals that cover all our teams,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd these are brands that have major investors, major funds\u2014that was certainly clear of the crypto world at the time. And so, yes, there\u2019s a league approval process, but it doesn\u2019t go deep into interviewing executives for every deal that comes through the league office.\u201d</p>\n<p>And in response to my mention of FTX, Silver appeared to suggest that because crypto prices are up right now, little-known crypto companies look less shady.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s go back to those [crypto] deals,\u201d he said. \u201cNow crypto\u2019s back up. We have deals with some of the crypto companies now, and now the market is killing, going crazy on crypto. So is there a different view now? I\u2019m just saying, we live in a market economy, there is a government that regulates these industries, there are teams and team owners that are risking their reputations and brands.\u201d </p>\n<p>I am certainly not suggesting the NBA needs to interview executives from every team sponsor to ensure they\u2019re honest and aboveboard. That would not be realistic. But clearly it should more closely scrutinize sponsors at the $300 million level. Because you have to wonder how many more Aspirations there are across the NBA\u2014and other leagues, too.</p>\n<p>Source:\u00a0https://frontofficesports.com/clippers-aspiration-fiasco-recalls-another-doomed-nba-sponsorship/</p>",

The auditory hallucinations, diagnosed in 2021 as schizophrenia, turned the big-hearted, caring side of his personality his family loved into a hypervigilant, protective paranoia that his parents, Elisabeth and Jeffrey, tried to de-escalate. As a last resort, they would call in Marta, a licensed therapist, and Duncan, who was Eli's \"whisperer.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<blockquote>\n<p>The voices were \"all about us being in danger,\" Marta said.</p>\n<p>Duncan said: \"The real challenge of that was the volatility. He would call me, he would make sure I was safe. He made sure I was OK. ... And then he could hang up. And sure enough, maybe, you know, 15 to 20 minutes later, he called me again.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo of course, in that stretch, I think, probably the greatest challenge was finding ways to compartmentalize and still try to perform. I always kept in perspective, like he\u2019s the one going through it. And obviously it impacts us as a family. We were all sort of constantly anxious and on edge, but that was never the priority, making sure we were OK. It was always making sure he was OK.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"It was this weird juxtaposition that I was sort of living my dream, really our dream, because it\u2019s what my brother wanted, too,\" he said. \"And then going 35 miles up the road and seeing this totally different experience of what my own flesh and blood, you know, my big brother was going through.</p>\n<p>\"Those are really some of the most challenging aspects in years for me, because he was so close. But in reality, it felt like he was so far. I would try to always have these points of contact, but it was really hard.\"</p>\n</blockquote><div><br></div><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0px; position: relative; padding-bottom: 177.778%;\"><iframe class=\"streamable-embed\" src=\"https://streamable.com/o/wii4b1\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>",

He wanted unlimited access to a private plane, a house and guaranteed off-court earnings from endorsements, The Athletic previously reported. He also wanted a slice of the team itself \u2014 just like the Lakers had given Magic Johnson 25 years earlier after HIV forced him into early retirement.</strong></p>\n<p>The asks \u2014 all considered circumvention of the salary cap in the eyes of the NBA \u2014 were turned down by the team.</p>\n<p>But Robertson asked for them again. And again. And again.</p>\n<p><strong>The Lakers repeatedly told Robertson that his requests were against the NBA\u2019s collective bargaining agreement. Outside of the negotiations, team sources said, the Lakers laughed at Robertson\u2019s audacity. And to Robertson himself, team president Jeanie Buss underscored the outrageousness of the requests by saying he should attempt to get other teams to agree to his terms in writing.</strong></p>\n<p>Leonard ultimately chose to sign with the LA Clippers in 2019, the team meeting a different demand by trading for co-star Paul George. Those 2019 negotiations led to an investigation by the NBA, which concluded there was no evidence that the Clippers granted any of Robertson\u2019s improper requests.</p>\n<p>Now, the dealings by Robertson and Leonard have surfaced again as the superstar forward, the Clippers and team owner Steve Ballmer face an investigation about whether the Clippers ran afoul of the league\u2019s salary cap rules. The investigation stems from a previously unannounced endorsement deal with Aspiration, a company with close business ties to the Clippers and Ballmer, that could have netted Leonard close to $50 million, as first reported by Pablo Torre on his \u201cPablo Torre Finds Out\u201d podcast earlier this month.</p>",
