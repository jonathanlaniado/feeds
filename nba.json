            "content_text": "[https://official.nba.com/l2m/L2MReport.html?gameId=0042000405](https://official.nba.com/l2m/L2MReport.html?gameId=0042000405)\n\nThis is not a \"swallow their whistle\" or \"playoff basketball\" non-call, it's just not a foul. Especially impressive watching Holiday in [slow motion](https://streamable.com/vhp207) time his strip to make sure he starts with ball and makes it clean. Many players would not have the discipline to time it properly and would have reached early and committed a foul.\n\n>Holiday (MIL) strips the ball from Booker (PHX). As Booker turns to expose the ball, there is incidental contact to his arm during the steal, which is not what dislodges the ball. ([Video](http://official.nba.com/last-two-minute-report/?gameNo=0042000405&eventNum=2334))\n\nAlso notable is that they deemed Booker's [reach on Middleton at 1:47.9](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/omisnu/highlight_middleton_fouled_by_booker_with_under_2/) an incorrect non-call, which was basically the [same play he did](https://youtu.be/ZUVtWZPmQvQ?t=29) on Holiday at the end of Game 4 (I have seen arguments about that not being a foul either due to it occurring in the low block). Both should have been fouls.\n\n>Booker (PHX) places a hand to Middleton's (MIL) opposite hip on his drive and affects his SQBR before he is able to reach and dislodge the ball. [(Video)](http://official.nba.com/last-two-minute-report/?gameNo=0042000405&eventNum=2325)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn my opinion the officiating in this series has been pretty rough, though Game 5 was *mostly* good. I'm just happy that so far, bad calls have not affected the outcome of the games (at least how I think what the outcome should be).",
