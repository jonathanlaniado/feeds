            "content_html": "<p><a href=\"https://www.basketballnews.com/stories/metta-world-peace-on-team-usa\">Source</a></p>\n<p><em>On the subject of international basketball, you played a season overseas and played under FIBA rules. We\u2019re about to start the Olympics with Team USA undergoing some changes. Bradley Beal is off the team. Kevin Love is off the team. Keldon Johnson and JaVale McGee joined the team. How do you see the Olympics playing out for Team USA?</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Metta World Peace: \u201cFor me, the Olympics is a bitter situation for me. I love the Olympics, and I feel like I\u2019ve been shortchanged. Even though I was a head case and a real volatile player when I did play, I just always felt like I should have had an opportunity to play [for Team USA]. The year I was going to play, I got suspended - and when you talk about legacy, that gold medal is very important to legacy. And I was a player, third-team All-NBA. I should have had a tryout. I remember when I didn\u2019t get called for the Olympics, and I thought at least I\u2019d play on the team that played against the people who got selected (the Select Team). And when that didn\u2019t happen, I called my agent and said, \u2018What the hell is going on here?!\u2019 And we could not get no response. So then, I had to call the Olympic office myself. And I got no return call. And I was like, \u2018Just let me try out.\u2019 I understand I wasn\u2019t the greatest player to be around at that time and some players did not want to play with me, but I was like, \u2018Give me a chance to take that player\u2019s spot.' At that time, in that era, my defense was so incredible, I was going to take someone\u2019s spot. I\u2019m 100 percent sure.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>That would have been the 2004 Olympics in Athens when the U.S. lost to Puerto Rico by 19 in the opener and ended up taking home the bronze.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Metta World Peace: \u201cYeah, you see what I\u2019m saying? We [wouldn\u2019t have] taken home a bronze. We\u2019d have a gold. I wasn\u2019t on that team. The USA had a goal in 2004 and there\u2019s no way we lose with me on that team. There\u2019s no way. How? I\u2019m averaging 24 and the best defender in the world at that point in time. I got Defensive Player of the Year in between sharks and blue whales, Ben Wallace and Duncan and Garnett. This is who I had to navigate through in order to get that award. Hall of Famers. With that being said, I understand why. But I just want people to hear: If I could rewind time, that is something that is supposed to be on my resume. Now, granted, a lot of things are not on my resume because of me, but I got Defensive Player of the Year, I was close to being MVP one year, I got champion, All-Star, everything but the Olympics. But I\u2019ve been to the Olympics in high school. I got the USA high school history. One day, I hope they pick me. Sometimes they pick veterans, they pick guys who don\u2019t play [anymore]. I hope I can play in the Olympics; I deserve it just as much as anybody, I believe. Some people would argue that other people deserve it also. That\u2019s true, but I am the one yapping about it. So hopefully one day an honorary jersey, end of the bench. I even told them I would get the water. I literally called the office. I told my agent, \u2018Can I even be the water boy? Something?\u2019 So every time someone brings up the Olympians, I rant, I rant I rant. I am an Olympian, for sure. I am an Olympian, a gold medalist, and I truly believe that.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen you look at it from a basketball standpoint, in terms of being that professional at that age, I wasn\u2019t. But I was a hell of a basketball player, and I felt like a hell of an American basketball player, one of the best American basketball players in the world. And although I\u2019m very much from Queensbridge and as urban as it gets in the NBA, at the same time I always wanted to represent the USA. And another reason why I wanted to represent the USA: Chris Mullin was an Olympian, I went to St. John\u2019s. Vern Fleming was a gold medalist Olympian, and Vern Fleming is from my neighborhood and everybody knows where I\u2019m from. Vern Fleming experienced all the things I talked about, just picture those situation with Vern Fleming, and he was an Olympian. He\u2019s from the same block, the same exact block as me. There\u2019s a lot of reasons why I wanted to be an Olympian. No matter what anybody says, I am an Olympian, I am a gold medalist. I didn\u2019t cut myself from that team.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>",

Harden is a former MVP, but he had only two guaranteed seasons left on his contract at the time of the trade. Portland could do even better because Lillard has four seasons remaining on his contract worth a grand total of $176 million.

The commenter doesn't go into much detail about Middleton, only briefly including him as a prospect to play backup SG/SF. Despite that, its the very first comment including him whatsover on r/nba so it earns a place here.</p>\n<p>The first comment actually <em>focused</em> on Middleton is from two weeks before the draft, where what I assume was a Thunder fan comments on a post asking about what player they think their team will draft: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/v5ix1/who_do_you_think_your_team_will_draft/c51n4e6?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">\"We really need someone who can come off the bench for KD who is an actual SF.

He appears that he would fit pretty well in this system.\"</a></p>\n<p><strong>AFTER THE DRAFT</strong></p>\n<p>The first mention of him after the draft is someone confused about <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/vqrxl/game_thread_2012_nba_draft/c573ozl?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">\"Why Khris Middleton with Doron Lamb, Tyshawn Taylor, and Darius Miller still on the board?\"</a></p>\n<p>In case you're wondering about the fate of those players, Doron Lamb was waived in 2014 and is playing basketball in Europe, Tyshawn Taylor was used by legendary Mavs coach Jason Kidd to get a free timeout by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEqU7JHkfu0\">bumping into him</a> and then waived, and Darius Miller was infamously a walking TPE, although probably the best player out of the three.</p>\n<p>Some more serious draft analysis had him pegged as <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/vsvmf/can_someone_post_this_insider_draft_grades/c57bun6?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">\"a smooth scorer with a great midrange game\"</a>. It's a nice read and seeing the optimism about MKG was a blast of nostalgia.</p>\n<p><strong>THE TRADE</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1jdllz/knight_middleton_and_krastov_to_be_traded_to_the/\">The trade thread</a>.</p>\n<p>To sum up the comments in a nutshell - the name Middleton is mentioned six times and half of those are jokes about Kate Middleton.</p>\n<p>If you ever needed proof Middleton was a throw-in in the trade here it is. Pretty much all of the discussion being had is about Knight/Jennings, although there are a few takes that have aged alarmingly well.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1jdllz/knight_middleton_and_krastov_to_be_traded_to_the/cbdm1b7?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">\"I have a feeling this one is gonna bite the Pistons in the ass.\"</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1jdllz/knight_middleton_and_krastov_to_be_traded_to_the/cbdu1l3?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">\"I think the steal of this trade might have been Khris Middleton.

We didn't give up any picks or expiring contracts, and Middleton and Kravstov weren't going to do much of anything. It was effectively a straight up Knight for Jennings trade, and Knight's super turnover prone. Sure, Jennings is immature, but he's still an upgrade over what we had before.

There have been reports in recent weeks that Houston has interest in trading up with Detroit to take Cunningham, but the vast majority of speculation from other teams has centered on Green as the presumptive fit at No. 2. His ability to create his own shot gives him a chance to be a legitimate offensive fulcrum, and the Rockets are positioned to take a swing on upside. For what it\u2019s worth, Green\u2019s camp is thought to prefer Houston as a destination, rather than landing in Cleveland one pick later. Devin Booker\u2019s evolution from promising scorer into a well-rounded perimeter centerpiece provides a blueprint for Green\u2019s development, with his exceptional athleticism giving him major upside.</p>\n</blockquote>",
