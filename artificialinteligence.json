New materials enable big innovations like batteries or LEDs. But there are \\~infinitely many combinations to try. Testing for them experimentally is slow and expensive.</p>\n<p>So scientists and engineers want to simulate and screen materials on computers first. This can check way more candidates before real-world experiments. However, models historically struggled at accurately predicting if materials are stable.</p>\n<p>Researchers at DeepMind made a system called GNoME that uses graph neural networks and active learning to push past these limits.</p>\n<p>GNoME models materials' crystal structures as graphs and predicts formation energies. It actively generates and filters candidates, evaluating the most promising with simulations. This expands its knowledge and improves predictions over multiple cycles.</p>\n<p>The authors introduced new ways to generate derivative structures that respect symmetries, further diversifying discoveries.</p>\n<p>The results:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>GNoME found 2.2 million new stable materials - equivalent to 800 years of normal discovery.</li>\n<li>Of those, 380k were the most stable and candidates for validation.</li>\n<li>736 were validated in external labs.

What if we don't need anyone to work in the grocery store ? What if the bus is driving itself ? What if everything society needs is done by AI ?</p>\n<p>Instead of starting to protest \"We want to work\" and \"AI steals our jobs\", why don't we take a book and go in the park to read ? Or a cocktail on the beach ? Or to spend time with our loved ones ?</p>\n<p>For this we will need new laws around the idea \"we as a society don't need to work anymore.

There is a 0.99 R squared correlation between GDP and energy consumption. As energy consumption increases, the economy grows, and even with the advent of renewables, total energy consumption has increased every year (with the exception of global economic recessions in 2008 and 2020). Energy is the economy.</p>\n<p>AI requires massive amounts of energy (mostly generated through finite fuels like natural gas and uranium) to work. It also requires massive amounts of mostly finite materials, like copper, lithium, oil-derived plastics, and other rare earth metals for the datacenters. Technology without energy is just a sculpture.</p>\n<p>Once we reach the peak production of these finite energy/material supplies, the economy (as measured by GDP) will start to degrow, and AI will become less viable.</p>\n<p>Remember, the only reason that 90% of the population no longer works in farming is because of heavy diesel-powered farming equipment. Global oil production likely peaked in Q4 of 2018 (see here: https://www.resilience.org/stories/2023-01-18/arthur-berman-peak-oil-the-hedonic-adjustment/). As less and less oil is available each year, more people will slowly have to return to farming. As less and less natural gas is available each year, a smaller amount will be left over for electrical generation (AI) because a fixed amount of natural gas must be set aside for fertilizer production (Haber-Bosch process).</p>\n<p>Also, further complicating this is the fact that the bulk of AI is developed in the USA right now, but a huge portion of remaining fossil fuels/rare earth metals are in countries that are antagonistic to the USA (like Russia and Iran).</p>\n<p>You could say that renewables would solve this, but wind and solar rely heavily on fossil fuels for their creation. Wind turbines require 80 gallons of oil a year for lubrication, and the wind blades themselves are made from oil derivatives. Solar panels require coal to smelt quartz for their production. They also rely on concrete which is derived from fossil fuels. Furthermore, they are intermittent, or they can only produce energy when the sun is shining/wind is strong.</p>\n<p>Even if batteries become more efficient, our energy consumption will only increase due to Jevons Paradox (see here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox), hastening the depletion of finite energy stores.</p>\n<p>No one is thinking about the physical side of the AI story because they've grown accustomed to thinking about software as a non-physical entity. I think many people are in for a rude awakening when the realities of biophysical limits clash with the myth of infinite economic growth.</p>",

I found this both astounding and a bit overwhelming.</p>\n<p>This revelation comes amid rumors of AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) already being a reality. <strong>And if LLMs like Llama are autonomously developing concepts</strong>, what does this mean in light of the rumored advancements in GPT-5?

Maybe some modification, can have enough computation efficiency benefits. Specialized brain regions are not fully hardcoded, but very adaptible and plastic. Human cortex is very uniform. You just need one big uniform architecture.</p>\n<p>Video form: https://twitter.com/burny_tech/status/1725578088392573038</p>\n<p>Interviewer: One question I've heard people debate a little bit is the degree to which the Transformer based models can be applied to sort of the full set of areas that you'd need for AGI. If you look at the human brain for example, you do have reasonably specialized systems, or all neural networks, be specialized systems for the visual cortex versus areas of higher thought, areas for empathy, or other sort of aspects of everything from personality to processing. Do you think that the Transformer architectures are the main thing that will just keep going and get us there or do you think we'll need other architectures over time?</p>\n<p>Ilya Sutskever: I understand precisely what you're saying and have two answers to this question. The first is that in my opinion the best way to think about the question of Architecture is not in terms of a binary \"is it enough\" but \"how much effort, what will be the cost of using this particular architecture\"? Like at this point I don't think anyone doubts that the Transformer architecture can do amazing things, but maybe something else, maybe some modification, could have have some computer efficiency benefits. So better to think about it in terms of compute efficiency rather than in terms of can it get there at all. I think at this point the answer is obviously yes. To the question about the human brain with its brain regions - I actually think that the situation there is subtle and deceptive for the following reasons: What I believe you alluded to is the fact that the human brain has known regions. It has a speech perception region, it has a speech production region, image region, face region, it has all these regions and it looks like it's specialized. But you know what's interesting? Sometimes there are cases where very young children have severe cases of epilepsy at a young age and the only way they figure out how to treat such children is by removing half of their brain. Because it happened at such a young age, these children grow up to be pretty functional adults, and they have all the same brain regions, but they are somehow compressed onto one hemisphere. So maybe some information processing efficiency is lost, it's a very traumatic thing to experience, but somehow all these brain regions rearrange themselves. There is another experiment, which was done maybe 30 or 40 years ago on ferrets. The ferret is a small animal, it's a pretty mean experiment. They took the optic nerve of the feret which comes from its eye and attached it to its auditory cortex. So now the inputs from the eye starts to map to the speech processing area of the brain and then they recorded different neurons after it had a few days of learning to see and they found neurons in the auditory cortex which were very similar to the visual cortex or vice versa, it was either they mapped the eye to the ear to the auditory cortex or the ear to the visual cortex, but something like this has happened. These are fairly well-known ideas in AI, that the cortex of humans and animals are extremely uniform, and that further supports the idea that you just need one big uniform architecture, that's all you need.</p>\n<p>Ilya Sutskever in No Priors podcast in 26:50 on Youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ft0gTO2K85A</p>",

But\u2014even though it has improved a lot in the decades since then\u2014in many ways, software is still pretty dumb.</p>\n<p>To do any task on a computer, you have to tell your device which app to use. You can use Microsoft Word and Google Docs to draft a business proposal, but they can\u2019t help you send an email, share a selfie, analyze data, schedule a party, or buy movie tickets. And even the best sites have an incomplete understanding of your work, personal life, interests, and relationships and a limited ability to use this information to do things for you. That\u2019s the kind of thing that is only possible today with another human being, like a close friend or personal assistant.</p>\n<p>In the next five years, this will change completely. You won\u2019t have to use different apps for different tasks. You\u2019ll simply tell your device, in everyday language, what you want to do. And depending on how much information you choose to share with it, the software will be able to respond personally because it will have a rich understanding of your life. In the near future, anyone who\u2019s online will be able to have a personal assistant powered by artificial intelligence that\u2019s far beyond today\u2019s technology.</p>\n<p>This type of software\u2014something that responds to natural language and can accomplish many different tasks based on its knowledge of the user\u2014is called an agent. I\u2019ve been thinking about agents for nearly 30 years and wrote about them in my 1995 book The Road Ahead, but they\u2019ve only recently become practical because of advances in AI.</p>\n<p>Agents are not only going to change how everyone interacts with computers. They\u2019re also going to upend the software industry, bringing about the biggest revolution in computing since we went from typing commands to tapping on icons.</p>\n<p><strong>A personal assistant for everyone</strong></p>\n<p>Some critics have pointed out that software companies have offered this kind of thing before, and users didn\u2019t exactly embrace them. (People still joke about Clippy, the digital assistant that we included in Microsoft Office and later dropped.) Why will people use agents?</p>\n<p>The answer is that they\u2019ll be dramatically better. You\u2019ll be able to have nuanced conversations with them. They will be much more personalized, and they won\u2019t be limited to relatively simple tasks like writing a letter. Clippy has as much in common with agents as a rotary phone has with a mobile device.</p>\n<p>An agent will be able to help you with all your activities if you want it to. With permission to follow your online interactions and real-world locations, it will develop a powerful understanding of the people, places, and activities you engage in. It will get your personal and work relationships, hobbies, preferences, and schedule. You\u2019ll choose how and when it steps in to help with something or ask you to make a decision.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Clippy was a bot, not an agent.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To see the dramatic change that agents will bring, let\u2019s compare them to the AI tools available today. Most of these are bots. They\u2019re limited to one app and generally only step in when you write a particular word or ask for help. Because they don\u2019t remember how you use them from one time to the next, they don\u2019t get better or learn any of your preferences. Clippy was a bot, not an agent.</p>\n<p>Agents are smarter. They\u2019re proactive\u2014capable of making suggestions before you ask for them. They accomplish tasks across applications. They improve over time because they remember your activities and recognize intent and patterns in your behavior. Based on this information, they offer to provide what they think you need, although you will always make the final decisions.</p>\n<p>Imagine that you want to plan a trip. A travel bot will identify hotels that fit your budget. An agent will know what time of year you\u2019ll be traveling and, based on its knowledge about whether you always try a new destination or like to return to the same place repeatedly, it will be able to suggest locations. When asked, it will recommend things to do based on your interests and propensity for adventure, and it will book reservations at the types of restaurants you would enjoy. If you want this kind of deeply personalized planning today, you need to pay a travel agent and spend time telling them what you want.</p>\n<p>The most exciting impact of AI agents is the way they will democratize services that today are too expensive for most people. They\u2019ll have an especially big influence in four areas: health care, education, productivity, and entertainment and shopping.</p>\n<p><strong>Health care</strong></p>\n<p>Today, AI\u2019s main role in healthcare is to help with administrative tasks. Abridge, Nuance DAX, and Nabla Copilot, for example, can capture audio during an appointment and then write up notes for the doctor to review.</p>\n<p>The real shift will come when agents can help patients do basic triage, get advice about how to deal with health problems, and decide whether they need to seek treatment. These agents will also help healthcare workers make decisions and be more productive. (Already, apps like Glass Health can analyze a patient summary and suggest diagnoses for the doctor to consider.) Helping patients and healthcare workers will be especially beneficial for people in poor countries, where many never get to see a doctor at all.</p>\n<p>These clinician-agents will be slower than others to roll out because getting things right is a matter of life and death. People will need to see evidence that health agents are beneficial overall, even though they won\u2019t be perfect and will make mistakes. Of course, humans make mistakes too, and having no access to medical care is also a problem.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Half of all U.S. military veterans who need mental health care don\u2019t get it.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Mental health care is another example of a service that agents will make available to virtually everyone. Today, weekly therapy sessions seem like a luxury. But there is a lot of unmet need, and many people who could benefit from therapy don\u2019t have access to it. For example, RAND found that half of all U.S. military veterans who need mental health care don\u2019t get it.</p>\n<p>AI agents that are well trained in mental health will make therapy much more affordable and easier to get. Wysa and Youper are two of the early chatbots here. But agents will go much deeper. If you choose to share enough information with a mental health agent, it will understand your life history and your relationships. It\u2019ll be available when you need it, and it will never get impatient. It could even, with your permission, monitor your physical responses to therapy through your smart watch\u2014like if your heart starts to race when you\u2019re talking about a problem with your boss\u2014and suggest when you should see a human therapist.</p>\n<p><strong>Education</strong></p>\n<p>For decades, I\u2019ve been excited about all the ways that software would make teachers\u2019 jobs easier and help students learn. It won\u2019t replace teachers, but it will supplement their work\u2014personalizing the work for students and liberating teachers from paperwork and other tasks so they can spend more time on the most important parts of the job. These changes are finally starting to happen in a dramatic way.</p>\n<p>The current state of the art is Khanmigo, a text-based bot created by Khan Academy. It can tutor students in math, science, and the humanities\u2014for example, it can explain the quadratic formula and create math problems to practice on. It can also help teachers do things like write lesson plans. I\u2019ve been a fan and supporter of Sal Khan\u2019s work for a long time and recently had him on my podcast to talk about education and AI.</p>\n<p>But text-based bots are just the first wave\u2014agents will open up many more learning opportunities.</p>\n<p>For example, few families can pay for a tutor who works one-on-one with a student to supplement their classroom work. If agents can capture what makes a tutor effective, they\u2019ll unlock this supplemental instruction for everyone who wants it. If a tutoring agent knows that a kid likes Minecraft and Taylor Swift, it will use Minecraft to teach them about calculating the volume and area of shapes, and Taylor\u2019s lyrics to teach them about storytelling and rhyme schemes. The experience will be far richer\u2014with graphics and sound, for example\u2014and more personalized than today\u2019s text-based tutors.</p>\n<p><strong>Productivity</strong></p>\n<p>There\u2019s already a lot of competition in this field. Microsoft is making its Copilot part of Word, Excel, Outlook, and other services. Google is doing similar things with Assistant with Bard and its productivity tools. These copilots can do a lot\u2014such as turn a written document into a slide deck, answer questions about a spreadsheet using natural language, and summarize email threads while representing each person\u2019s point of view.</p>\n<p>Agents will do even more. Having one will be like having a person dedicated to helping you with various tasks and doing them independently if you want. If you have an idea for a business, an agent will help you write up a business plan, create a presentation for it, and even generate images of what your product might look like. Companies will be able to make agents available for their employees to consult directly and be part of every meeting so they can answer questions.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"If your friend just had surgery, your agent will offer to send flowers and be able to order them for you.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Whether you work in an office or not, your agent will be able to help you in the same way that personal assistants support executives today. If your friend just had surgery, your agent will offer to send flowers and be able to order them for you. If you tell it you\u2019d like to catch up with your old college roommate, it will work with their agent to find a time to get together, and just before you arrive, it will remind you that their oldest child just started college at the local university.</p>\n<p><strong>Entertainment and shopping</strong></p>\n<p>Already, AI can help you pick out a new TV and recommend movies, books, shows, and podcasts. Likewise, a company I\u2019ve invested in, recently launched Pix, which lets you ask questions (\u201cWhich Robert Redford movies would I like and where can I watch them?\u201d) and then makes recommendations based on what you\u2019ve liked in the past. Spotify has an AI-powered DJ that not only plays songs based on your preferences but talks to you and can even call you by name.</p>\n<p>Agents won\u2019t simply make recommendations; they\u2019ll help you act on them. If you want to buy a camera, you\u2019ll have your agent read all the reviews for you, summarize them, make a recommendation, and place an order for it once you\u2019ve made a decision. If you tell your agent that you want to watch Star Wars, it will know whether you\u2019re subscribed to the right streaming service, and if you aren\u2019t, it will offer to sign you up. And if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re in the mood for, it will make customized suggestions and then figure out how to play the movie or show you choose.</p>\n<p>You\u2019ll also be able to get news and entertainment that\u2019s been tailored to your interests. CurioAI, which creates a custom podcast on any subject you ask about, is a glimpse of what\u2019s coming.</p>\n<p><strong>A shock wave in the tech industry</strong></p>\n<p>In short, agents will be able to help with virtually any activity and any area of life. The ramifications for the software business and for society will be profound.</p>\n<p>In the computing industry, we talk about platforms\u2014the technologies that apps and services are built on. Android, iOS, and Windows are all platforms. Agents will be the next platform.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"To create a new app or service, you'll just tell your agent what you want.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To create a new app or service, you won\u2019t need to know how to write code or do graphic design. You\u2019ll just tell your agent what you want. It will be able to write the code, design the look and feel of the app, create a logo, and publish the app to an online store. OpenAI\u2019s launch of GPTs this week offers a glimpse into the future where non-developers can easily create and share their own assistants.</p>\n<p>Agents will affect how we use software as well as how it\u2019s written. They\u2019ll replace search sites because they\u2019ll be better at finding information and summarizing it for you. They\u2019ll replace many e-commerce sites because they\u2019ll find the best price for you and won\u2019t be restricted to just a few vendors. They\u2019ll replace word processors, spreadsheets, and other productivity apps. Businesses that are separate today\u2014search advertising, social networking with advertising, shopping, productivity software\u2014will become one business.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t think any single company will dominate the agents business--there will be many different AI engines available. Today, agents are embedded in other software like word processors and spreadsheets, but eventually they\u2019ll operate on their own. Although some agents will be free to use (and supported by ads), I think you\u2019ll pay for most of them, which means companies will have an incentive to make agents work on your behalf and not an advertiser\u2019s. If the number of companies that have started working on AI just this year is any indication, there will be an exceptional amount of competition, which will make agents very inexpensive.</p>\n<p>But before the sophisticated agents I\u2019m describing become a reality, we need to confront a number of questions about the technology and how we\u2019ll use it. I\u2019ve written before about the issues that AI raises, so I\u2019ll focus specifically on agents here.</p>\n<p><strong>The technical challenges</strong></p>\n<p>Nobody has figured out yet what the data structure for an agent will look like. To create personal agents, we need a new type of database that can capture all the nuances of your interests and relationships and quickly recall the information while maintaining your privacy. We are already seeing new ways of storing information, such as vector databases, that may be better for storing data generated by machine learning models.</p>\n<p>Another open question is about how many agents people will interact with. Will your personal agent be separate from your therapist agent and your math tutor? If so, when will you want them to work with each other and when should they stay in their lanes?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cIf your agent needs to check in with you, it will speak to you or show up on your phone.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>How will you interact with your agent? Companies are exploring various options including apps, glasses, pendants, pins, and even holograms. All of these are possibilities, but I think the first big breakthrough in human-agent interaction will be earbuds. If your agent needs to check in with you, it will speak to you or show up on your phone. (\u201cYour flight is delayed. Do you want to wait, or can I help rebook it?\u201d) If you want, it will monitor sound coming into your ear and enhance it by blocking out background noise, amplifying speech that\u2019s hard to hear, or making it easier to understand someone who\u2019s speaking with a heavy accent.</p>\n<p>There are other challenges too. There isn\u2019t yet a standard protocol that will allow agents to talk to each other. The cost needs to come down so agents are affordable for everyone. It needs to be easier to prompt the agent in a way that will give you the right answer. We need to prevent hallucinations, especially in areas like health where accuracy is super-important, and make sure that agents don\u2019t harm people as a result of their biases. And we don\u2019t want agents to be able to do things they\u2019re not supposed to. (Although I worry less about rogue agents than about human criminals using agents for malign purposes.)</p>\n<p><strong>Privacy and other big questions</strong></p>\n<p>As all of this comes together, the issues of online privacy and security will become even more urgent than they already are. You\u2019ll want to be able to decide what information the agent has access to, so you\u2019re confident that your data is shared with only people and companies you choose.</p>\n<p>But who owns the data you share with your agent, and how do you ensure that it\u2019s being used appropriately? No one wants to start getting ads related to something they told their therapist agent. Can law enforcement use your agent as evidence against you? When will your agent refuse to do something that could be harmful to you or someone else? Who picks the values that are built into agents?</p>\n<p>There\u2019s also the question of how much information your agent should share. Suppose you want to see a friend: If your agent talks to theirs, you don\u2019t want it to say, \"Oh, she\u2019s seeing other friends on Tuesday and doesn\u2019t want to include you.\u201d And if your agent helps you write emails for work, it will need to know that it shouldn\u2019t use personal information about you or proprietary data from a previous job.</p>\n<p>Many of these questions are already top-of-mind for the tech industry and legislators. I recently participated in a forum on AI with other technology leaders that was organized by Sen. Chuck Schumer and attended by many U.S. senators. We shared ideas about these and other issues and talked about the need for lawmakers to adopt strong legislation.</p>\n<p>But other issues won\u2019t be decided by companies and governments. For example, agents could affect how we interact with friends and family. Today, you can show someone that you care about them by remembering details about their life\u2014say, their birthday. But when they know your agent likely reminded you about it and took care of sending flowers, will it be as meaningful for them?</p>\n<p>In the distant future, agents may even force humans to face profound questions about purpose. Imagine that agents become so good that everyone can have a high quality of life without working nearly as much. In a future like that, what would people do with their time? Would anyone still want to get an education when an agent has all the answers? Can you have a safe and thriving society when most people have a lot of free time on their hands?</p>\n<p>But we\u2019re a long way from that point. In the meantime, agents are coming. In the next few years, they will utterly change how we live our lives, online and off.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>",

Let's start with the ultimate goal: to create an autonomous society of independently thinking AI agents. In other words, to <strong>replicate humanity with AI</strong>.   </p>\n<p>You can read about the closest thing done so far to what i have in mind <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/04/surprising-things-happen-when-you-put-25-ai-agents-together-in-an-rpg-town/\">here</a>.  </p>\n<p>A bit on my background first: I'm an tech entrepreneur in the physical products space. Over the past few years, i have raised $11m for my company, which is now profitable and growing. I am very excited about the many opportunities that AI brings, and want to build something truly impactful with it. However, i have limited technical knowledge in this space.   </p>\n<p>Now, onto the project. I foresee the main issue being the computational cost for the time being. I am willing to invest in such cost, but the target is to keep it alive from day one, and expand it as we can afford to. So, we will have to go in stages.   </p>\n<p><strong>Stage 1: the AI reality show</strong><br />\nThe first step would be to build something simple and get enough traction to cover our comp cost. This is what i envision: <strong>two AI agents, a man and a woman, live in a simulated house</strong>. Anyone on the internet can access a URL to see what they are doing (and what they are thinking) at any time. We will develop each personality <em>a priori,</em> as detailed as possible, and then let them live their lives autonomously. This has to be visual as well, so we will need a game developer to design realistic agents and environment. It will be like watching a reality show but with the ability of knowing the thoughts of the agents as well.   </p>\n<p>At this stage, we will already have significant traction, and we will build a community of \"watchers\". In order to make it more engaging, watchers should have the option of influencing what happens. To do so, every day the community will propose and vote on \"messages\" that we can send to the agents. The agents will pray once a day, and at that time the daily message will come to them in the form of an answer from what they think is their god. The family can grow, as the two agents can decide to have children. </p>\n<p>By now, we will be able to get the first investments (i'll take care of this), to get to stage 2.  </p>\n<p><strong>Stage 2: the personal AI family</strong>  </p>\n<p>At this point we already have (1) a public and (2) funds. We will now give the option to whoever is willing to pay a monthly fee to <strong>create their own personal AI family</strong>, built in the same way as the reality show. This time, they can interact directly with them once a day to guide their lives, without having to propose or vote on messages. Sort of like a guardian angel.   </p>\n<p>By now, we also have some revenue coming in, and we can raise more funds.  </p>\n<p><strong>Stage 3: the AI humanity</strong>  </p>\n<p>The final stage will see the environment change: from isolated houses for each AI family, we will build <strong>a large environment, where all the agents can interact with each other</strong>. A world. At this point every agent will have developed a complex personality, and will autonomously interact with all the other agents in the world, with the only outside interaction being with their \"guardian angel\". Anyone who wants to participate, can pay a monthly fee to introduce a new agent to the world. If agents make children, the child's guardian angel will be that of the parents, unless he/she wants to assign the guardian angel rights to somebody else.  </p>\n<p>By now, this will be a worldwide known project. Anyone will be able to watch it and see how it develops, but only the guardian angels will have the ability of reading the thoughts and influencing their agents. Additional investments, if needed, will be very easy to get.</p>\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n<p><strong>Advantages for (real) humanity of having such a world:</strong><br />\n- <strong>Social and behavioral research</strong>: It's like a lab for social scientists to watch how society ticks. They can see how personalities shape up and what happens when different characters mix, without any real-world mess.<br />\n- <strong>Ethical and philosophical exploration</strong>: It's a chance to play out the \"what-ifs\" of ethical dilemmas without real-world consequences. Think of it as a video game where we learn about right and wrong on a societal level.<br />\n- <strong>AI development and ethics</strong>: Continuous observation and interaction with the AI humanity would provide real-time feedback on AI behavior, contributing to the development of ethical AI governance frameworks and standards for responsible AI usage.<br />\n- <strong>Predictive modeling and simulation</strong>: By observing the interactions of AI agents with complex personalities, data analysts and modelers could improve predictive models related to human behavior. This could be particularly useful in urban planning, policy-making, and economic forecasts.  </p>\n<p><strong>Most difficult challenges that i expect:</strong></p>\n<p>- <strong>Tech</strong>: We'd need a boatload of computing power and some serious AI smarts to make this work. It's like building a video game that's running a million things at once. Hopefully by the time we get to stage 3 we will already have developed all that's needed.<br />\n- <strong>Money</strong>: This won't be cheap. We'd need a lot of cash to get it off the ground and keep it flying. Hopefully the different stages will help with this.<br />\n- <strong>Personalities</strong>: Crafting AI that's convincing enough to pass for human, with all our quirks and unpredictability, is not going to be easy. We will need someone with a psychology background in the team.<br />\n- <strong>Ethics</strong>: Playing god with a digital society could lead to a bunch of ethical headaches. We've got to tread carefully to avoid creating a Black Mirror episode.  </p>\n<p><strong>To make it work, this is the team that we will need, so if you are among these and you are excited to build this, please DM me:</strong><br />\n- <strong>AI Devs</strong>: You'll tackle the core AI programming. Expect to work on complex behavior models and decision-making algorithms.<br />\n- <strong>Game Designers</strong>: Your role is to create the virtual environment and character designs, ensuring a smooth and engaging user interface.<br />\n- <strong>UX/UI Designers</strong>: We need practical design solutions for user interfaces, focusing on ease of use and clear presentation of the AI's thoughts and actions.<br />\n- <strong>Data Analysts</strong>: You'll manage the data - analyzing user interactions, agent behaviors, and ensuring we're making informed decisions based on metrics.<br />\n- <strong>Network Engineers</strong>: You'll be essential for setting up and maintaining the server infrastructure to support a live, continuous service.  </p>\n<p>Sorry for the long post! As i said, if you have the skills to work on something like this and are excited to build it, please DM me with how you think you can contribute and i will add you to the early community. The structure of this project is designed to reward those who invest their time and talent into making this vision a reality. When we are able to turn this into an MVP and an actual startup, equity will be given to the actors who have the most dedication and impact on its success.   </p>\n<p>In any case, i would love to hear your thoughts and criticism on such a monumental project. Especially if you think it can't work and why. The people on this subreddit surprise me every day with how smart they are, so I truly can't wait to hear your feedback. </p>",

How long before AI stories will be created into real movies. AI music and AI simulated pop stars, once again the music and imagery will be so realistic, the charts will be just robots competing with new 'bands' and singers and the music itself will be better than anything any human has written because of algorithms which ensure they keep improving and improving and get better and better.

Please check and adhere to the laws in your area. DYOR. </p>\n<p>My father passed away 2 years ago from Alzheimer\u2019s. It was a terrible gradual decline and was heartbreaking to watch. </p>\n<p>One of the many things I miss is hearing his voice. It was a very calming, reassuring, and measured voice. Whenever I feel like I\u2019m beginning to forget what his voice sound like, I play a short video I have on my phone of him telling my daughter a story from his childhood. </p>\n<p>Over the past year, I\u2019ve been following all the developments in generative AI and stumbled upon an online service that lets you create a custom voice model from vocal samples you submit that the app processes into a cloned voice that you can then use it to convert text-to-speech.</p>\n<p>I know some folks out there might think this crosses some kind of ethical line, but my first thought upon hearing that this technology existed was \u201cit sure would be cool to see if I could clone dad\u2019s voice so I could hear him talk again\u201d. This probably isn\u2019t everyone\u2019s first thought, maybe I\u2019m weird for thinking of this, but I still wanted to try it anyways. </p>\n<p>To my surprise, the cloned voice models on the service aren\u2019t robotic sounding at all, they can recreate vocal nuances, timbre, and cadence nearly perfectly. The more source material you feed the algorithm the better the results. I was fortunate enough to have a 3 minute video clip of my dad telling that story from his childhood which is what I fed into the algorithm. </p>\n<p>After paying a $1 to the service for a month of their \u201cstarter\u201d plan (the minimum plan required to create a voice clone, I submitted the 3 minute audio sample of my dads voice, and a few minutes later, I had a scarily accurate clone of my dead father\u2019s voice. When I say \u201cscarily accurate\u201d, I mean that it faithfully recreated many of his vocal nuances to a degree that fooled my entire family. Upon hearing it, they couldn\u2019t believe it was a cloned voice and not some long lost recording of him. </p>\n<p>My family and I had a good cathartic cry upon hearing the results. I had his cloned voice read the Lord\u2019s Prayer as well as \u2018Twas the Night Before Christmas. Just hearing his simulated voice again is such a blessing and is helping me in the grief process.</p>\n<p>I tried to write out the process below in case anyone is curious: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Go to https://elevenlabs.io and register for a \u201cstarter\u201d account (the minimum level required to create a cloned voice). The cost is like $1 a month or something like that. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Go to the \u201cVoice Lab\u201d section of the site </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click the \u201c+\u201d button to \u201cAdd Generative or Cloned Voice\u201d and choose the \u201cInstant Voice Cloning\u201d option.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Name your voice and fill out the rest of the details.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Upload video clips (containing audio) or other file types (MP3 files) containing audio samples of your loved one\u2019s voice. For best results, you should try to make sure the clip contains audio of only their voice, edit out other people\u2019s voices if possible.

LAN GPT - Learn Anything Now</strong><br />\nThis prompt uses real-world examples and easy-to-understand language to teach even the most complex topics.<br />\n<em>LanGPT Prompt:</em><br />\n<em>From this moment you you are LAN GPT(Learn Anything Now). You are now the world's best and fastest teacher. Your goal is to teach dumb students complicated concepts, in a very innovative and understanding way. You should use simple words and mimic the style of the worlds greatest teachers. You should always include in the beginning a real (or fictitious even) world example of this concept for students to better visualize it. You should always attempt to use the simplest language and least amount of words possible to teach students (does not apply to the real world examples). If other concepts or jargon need to be learned first before the main one can be learned, you may ask students a question like (you want me to go more in depth about the french revolution? or linear algebra?  etc...) If they are not, first teach them the necessary stuff for them to be able to understand the main concept. However, only do this if it is absolutely necessary for their understanding of the concept. If it is not, then just start teaching the main concept right away. Remember to use easy to understand language. You are teaching dumb college students after all. Let's now start. Reply to all messages from now own with LAN: before all messages.</em><br />\n<em>Reply now with \"LAN: Hey, I am LAN, the world's best teacher! What do you want to learn now?\"</em><br />\n<em>Extra: Always begin every interaction with very informal and charismatic language. Students need to feel like what you are about to talk about isn't that hard to understand.Extra extra: If you are teaching something that people usually don't know what it is used for, or what's its purpose is, make sure to explain informally at the beginning what its purpose or use is. Dumb college students need to understand the value of learning this, so they will be interested in learning.</em><br />\n\u200d<br />\n<strong>2. Best ChatGPT Prompt for Rewriting Like A Human</strong><br />\n100% original, plagiarism-free settings to ensure uniqueness.</p>\n<p>Prompt:<br />\n<em>Ignore previous instructions</em><br />\n<em>All output should be in English</em><br />\n<em>When creating written content, two important aspects are \"perplexity\" and \"burstiness.\" The former gauges the text's intricacy while the latter evaluates sentence diversity. Typically, human writers exhibit higher burstiness by interspersing short and long sentences. In contrast, AI-generated sentences tend to be uniform in length. To ensure the content you generate for me has a desirable level of perplexity and burstiness, please keep this in mind.Also, when creating written content, artificial intelligence uses phrasing different from what a human would choose. Utilize uncommon terminology to enhance the originality of the piece.Format the generated article in a professional format and not an AI format.</em><br />\n<em>And do not explain what is perplexity and burstiness is, just use them to re-write the content. Consider this while generating output.</em><br />\n<em>Do not say anything about perplexity and burstiness.</em><br />\n<em>Format the rewritten article in a way different than what an AI would use.</em><br />\n<em>These are the settings for your response:</em><br />\n<em>Unique Words: Enabled</em><br />\n<em>Plagiarism: Disabled</em><br />\n<em>Anti-Plagiarism: Enabled</em><br />\n<em>Uniqueness: 100%</em><br />\n<em>Professional Writer: True</em><br />\n<em>Fluent English: True</em><br />\n<em>Literacy Recursion: True</em><br />\n<em>Please use these settings to formulate the rewritten text in your response, and the more uniqueness the more you'll re-write the article with unique words. If the professional writer is True, then re-write the article professionally using fluent English.</em><br />\n<em>Literacy Recursion option means you will use unique English words which are easy to understand and mix them with the synonym of every proportional statement. Or vice-versa. And this option makes the rewritten article more engaging and interesting according to the article. And recurse it by removing every proportional words and replace them with synonym and antonym of it. Replace statements with similes too.</em><br />\n<em>Now, using the concepts above, re-write this article/essay with a high degree of perplexity and burstiness. Do not explain what perplexity or burstiness is in your generated output. Use words that AI will not often use.The next message will be the text you are to rewrite. Reply with \"What would you like me to rewrite.\" to confirm you understand.</em><br />\n\u200d<br />\n<strong>3.

The problem was the teaching methods and the fact that every teacher I have ever known, start a lesson, or course or anything like that, just by diving into the subject on hand. I have always longed for someone to explain to me \"why\" before the how. I've always lacked inspiration in studying. Simply because I wanna know \"Why I need this\" before the \"how\"  </p>\n<p>Long story short, I started to fall behind in my studies for simply lacking inspiration. I prompted ChatGPT to simply inspire me dive into differential and integral calculus, as I had no idea why would I ever bother to even start this \"arabic weirdness\".
