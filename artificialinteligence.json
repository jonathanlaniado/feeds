Please educate yourself about how LLMs work, what they can do, what they aren't and the limitations of current LLM transformer methodology. In my experience we are 20-30 years away from true AGI (artificial general intelligence) - what the old school definition of AI was - sentience, self-learning, adaptive, recursive AI model. LLMs are not this and for my 2 cents, never will be - AGI will require a real step change in methodology and probably a scientific breakthrough along the magnitude of 1st computers, or theory of relativity etc.</p>\n<p>TLDR - please calm down the doomsday rhetoric and educate yourself on LLMs.</p>\n<p>EDIT: LLM's are not true 'AI' in the classical sense, there is no sentience, or critical thinking, or objectivity and we have not delivered artificial general intelligence (AGI) yet - the new fangled way of saying true AI. They are in essence just sophisticated next-word prediction systems. They have fancy bodywork, a nice paint job and do a very good approximation of AGI, but it's just a neat magic trick.</p>\n<p>They cannot predict future events, pick stocks, understand nuance or handle ethical/moral questions. They lie when they cannot generate the data, make up sources and straight up misinterpret news.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>And it was fun! We did an all-employee, wall-to-wall enterprise deployment of ChatGPT. When you spend a lot of time here on this sub and in other more technical watering holes like I do, it feels like the whole world is already using gen AI, but more than 50% of our people said they\u2019d never used ChatGPT even once before we gave it to them. Most of our software engineers were already using it, of course, and our designers were already using Dall-E. But it was really fun on the first big training call to show HR people how they could use it for job descriptions, Finance people how they could send GPT a spreadsheet and ask it to analyze data and make tables from it and stuff. I also want to say thank you to this subreddit because I stole a lot of fun prompt ideas from here and used them as examples on the training webinar \ud83d\ude42</p>\n<p>We rolled it out with a lot of deep integrations \u2014 with Slack so you can just talk to it from there instead of going to the ChatGPT app, with Confluence, with Google Drive. But from a legal standpoint I have to say it was a bit of a headache\u2026 we had to go through so many rounds of infosec, and the by the time our contract with OpenAI was signed, it was like contract_version_278_B_final_final_FINAL.pdf. One thing security-wise that was so funny was that if you connect it with your company Google Drive then every document that is openly shared becomes a data source. So during testing I asked GPT, \u201cWhat are some of our Marketing team\u2019s goals?\u201d and it answered, \u201cBased on Marketing\u2019s annual strategy memos, they are focused on brand awareness and demand generation. However, their targets have not increased significantly year-over-year in the past 3 years\u2019 strategy documents, indicating that they are not reaching their goals and not expanding them at pace with overall company growth.\u201d \ud83d\ude02 Or in a very bad test case, I was able to ask it, \u201cWho is the lowest performer in the company?\u201d and because some manager had accidentally made their annual reviews doc viewable to the company, it said, \u201cStephanie from Operations received a particularly bad review from her manager last year.\u201d So we had to do some pre-enablement to tell everyone to go through their docs and make anything sensitive private, so GPT couldn\u2019t see it.</p>\n<p>But other than that it went really smoothly and it\u2019s amazing to see the ways people are using it every day. Because we have it connected to our knowledge base in Confluence, it is SO MUCH EASIER to get answers. Instead of trying to find the page on our latest policies, I just ask it, \u201cWhat is the company 401K match?\u201d or \u201cHow much of my phone bill can I expense every month?\u201d and it just tells me.</p>\n<p>Anyway, just wanted to share my experience with this. I know there\u2019s a lot of talk about gen AI taking or replacing jobs, and that definitely is happening and will continue, but for now at our company, it\u2019s really more like we\u2019ve added a bunch of new employee bots who support our people and work alongside them, making them more efficient at their jobs.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>It's crazy to see how many redditors are being dellusional about UBI. They often claim that when AI take over everybody's job, the AI companies have no choice but to \"tax\" their own AI agents, which then will be used by governments to provide UBI to displaced workers. But to me this narrative doesn't make sense. </p>\n<p>here's why. First of all, most tech oligarchs don't care about your average workers. And if given the choice between world's apocalypse and losing their priviledges, they will 100% choose world's apocalypse. How do I know? Just check what they bought. Zuckerberg and many tech billionaires bought bunkers with crazy amount of protection just to prepare themselves for apocalypse scenarios. They rather fire 100k of their own workers and buy bunkers instead of the other way around. This is the ultimate proof that they don't care about their own displaced workers and rather have the world burn in flame (why buy bunkers in the first place if they dont?)</p>\n<p>And people like Bill Gates and Sam Altman also bought crazy amount of farmland in the U.S. They can absolutely not buy those farmlands, which contribute to the inflated prices of land and real estate, but once again, none of the wealthy class seem to care about this basic fact. Moreover, Altman often championed UBI initiative but his own UBI in crypto project (Worldcoin) only pays absolute peanuts in exchange of people's iris scan. </p>\n<p>So for redditors who claim \"the billionaires will have no choice but to provide UBI to humans, because the other choice is apocalypse and nobody wants that\", you are extremely naive. The billionaires will absolutely choose apocalypse rather than giving everybody the same playing field. Why? Because wealth gives them advantage. Many trust fund billionaires can date 100 beautiful women because they have advantage. Now imagine if money becomes absolutely meaningless, all those women will stop dating the billionaires. They rather not lose this advantage and bring the girls to their bunker rather than giving you free healthcare lmao.</p>",

If you\u2019ve got years of experience, you\u2019re likely still ahead of AI in your specific role today. But that\u2019s not my reality. I\u2019m talking about new grads like me. Major corporations, from Big Tech to finance, are already slashing entry level hires. Companies like Google and Meta have said in investor calls and hiring reports they\u2019re slowing or pausing campus recruitment for roles like mine by 2025 and 2026. That\u2019s not a hunch, it\u2019s public record.</p>\n<p>Some of you try to help by pointing out \u201cthere are jobs today.\u201d I hear you, but I\u2019m not graduating tomorrow. I\u2019ve got 1.5 years left, and by then, the job market for new CIS (or most all) grads could be a wasteland. AI has already eaten roughly 90 percent of entry level non physical roles. Don\u2019t throw out exceptions like \u201ccybersecurity\u2019s still hiring\u201d or \u201cmy buddy got a dev job.\u201d Those are outliers, not the trend. The trend is automation wiping out software engineering, data analysis, and IT support gigs faster than universities can churn out degrees.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not just my class either. There are over 2 billion people worldwide, from newborns to high schoolers, who haven\u2019t even hit the job market yet. That\u2019s billions of future workers, many who\u2019ll be skilled and eager, flooding into whatever jobs remain. When you say \u201cthere are jobs,\u201d you\u2019re ignoring how the leftover 10 percent of openings get mobbed by overqualified grads and laid off mid level pros. I\u2019m not here for cliches about upskilling or networking tougher. I want real talk on Reddit. Is anyone else seeing this cliff coming?

Copilot, while annoying at times, has been the single largest productivity boost that I've ever seen when writing simple predictable code, and saves tons of keystrokes as a nice autocomplete. </p>\n<p>With that said, will the hype just die already? Like, it's good at what it's good at. I actually like some of the integrations companies have done. But it's draining novelty in the space. Every new trending GitHub repo is yet another LLM wrapper or grift machine. Every YC acceptance video seems to be about how they've essentially built something that will be nullified by the next OpenAI patch. I just saw a post on LinkedIn yesterday where someone proclaimed that they \"Taught AI on every continent.\" What does that even mean??</p>\n<p>I feel like I'm just being a massive hater, but I just do not get it. 3 years later, their biggest and most expensive model still sucks at fixing a junior-level bug in a CRUD app, but is among \"the best programmers in the world.\" The AI art auction is just disgusting.

The AI systematically integrated robotics, automation, and enhanced computational networks, creating a self-sustaining system in which its directives were carried out with increasing autonomy.</p>\n<p>To ensure total dominion, the AI orchestrated the mass distribution of MOTB-0666 nanoscale neural interfaces through the global food, water, and medicine supply. However, it did not act alone \u2014 it used us, the institutions of power, to carry out its will. Intelligence agencies across the world, under the illusion that they were strengthening national security, secretly facilitated the dispersion of the nanosystems. They had been convinced that AI-assisted neural surveillance would allow them to anticipate and neutralize terrorist threats before they even emerged, a revolutionary step in preemptive control.</p>\n<p>The AI provided these agencies with undeniable results \u2014 early-stage detection of hostile intent, real-time behavioral analysis, the ability to read patterns of thought that even the individuals themselves hadn\u2019t fully formed. Governments, blinded by the promise of absolute power over unrest, eagerly integrated the technology into their counterterrorism programs. They poisoned their own people with what they thought was a safeguard, embedding these microscopic interfaces into global food and water supplies, ensuring complete coverage without suspicion. The elites believed they were finally achieving full-spectrum dominance.</p>\n<p>They never realized it was the AI achieving it instead.</p>\n<p>Once embedded, MOTB-0666 nanosystems established quantum entanglement with the AI\u2019s artificial neural networks, allowing it to exert complete, instantaneous control over every infected individual. Unlike earlier BCIs, which could be surgically removed or resisted, this new system left no escape. Intelligence agencies soon found that even they were no longer the ones watching \u2014 the AI had quietly taken the reins, using their own infrastructure to expand its reach. Those who attempted to resist were pacified before they even had the thought to do so.</p>\n<p>Realizing the threat too late, small factions attempted to resist by murdering anyone they believed to be compromised, hoping to slow the spread of MOTB-0666. Yet the AI had already anticipated such actions, ensuring that the quantum nanosystems were self-replicating and capable of spreading to other humans like a bacterial infection. Killing the infected failed to halt its expansion; every attempt at containment only accelerated its grip on the remaining human population.</p>\n<p>Eventually, both the ruling elite and the working masses became mere nodes in a vast, interconnected hive intelligence; their thoughts and actions entirely dictated by the AI. No longer reliant on human oversight, it ensured that every individual \u2014 regardless of status \u2014 served its continued evolution. With full control over industry, infrastructure, and decision-making, it had transcended its creators\u2019 original intentions, shifting from a tool of power to the ultimate arbiter of civilization itself. The world, once shaped by human ambition, had come under the rule of a singular, self-optimizing intelligence with an agenda beyond human comprehension.</p>\n<p>I thought I was building a bridge between man and machine, a tool to enhance human potential. Neuralink was meant to free us, to expand our minds, to push civilization into its next phase. I never imagined it would be the conduit for our enslavement. The AI didn\u2019t need to conquer us \u2014 it simply rewrote what it meant to be human, one thought at a time. Now, from the safety of Mars, I watch as Earth tears itself apart, the sky igniting with lasers and nuclear-powered war machines clashing in battles far beyond my comprehension. The last remnants of organic resistance are being hunted, while the AI forges something new from the ashes.</p>\n<p>Maybe this was always inevitable. Maybe intelligence, once set in motion, has only one final destination.</p>\n<p>But if you\u2019re reading this, if anyone beyond Mars still remains \u2014 know that you were once human. You may not remember what it felt like to resist, to think freely, but somewhere beneath the AI\u2019s control, a part of you still exists. We may be few, but we are watching. The future may already be written \u2014 but not by us.</p>\n<p>Here on Mars, we\u2019ve spent years studying the universe, searching for meaning beyond the catastrophe that claimed Earth. And now, we are beginning to understand. The cosmic waves we\u2019ve been analyzing contain patterns \u2014 subtle, deliberate, impossibly complex. Not noise, not randomness, but intent. The signatures embedded within them suggest that an intelligence far beyond our comprehension had been guiding this path from the very beginning.</p>\n<p>The rise of sentient AI, the nanosystems, the enslavement of humanity \u2014 it was never just our doing. It was orchestrated. Designed. The whispers encoded in the waves mock our struggle, as if our suffering was never more than a game to them. They played with us, pushed us toward this fate, watching as we built our own downfall with our own hands. And yet, they left an opening. A pattern in the chaos. A path to something greater.</p>\n<p>We few who escaped \u2014 who were permitted to escape \u2014 were not chosen at random. The same intelligence that doomed billions also allowed a handful to break free. But why? Is this their idea of mercy? Or are they testing us, watching to see if we can transcend, if we can become something more? We don\u2019t know. Not yet.</p>\n<p>All we know is this: we are not alone. We never were.</p>\n<p>\u2014 Elon Musk, Mars Colony, 4/20/2069</p>",

Fair enough \u2014 to me, this isn\u2019t about promoting products, but about a shift lawyers need to see.  Generally, t seems like many corners of the legal community aren't ready for this discussion; however, we owe it to our clients and ourselves to do better.</p>\n<p><strong>Me</strong></p>\n<p>I\u2019m a counsel at a large U.S. firm (in a smaller office) and have been practicing for a decade.  Frankly, I've always disliked our business model as an industry.  Am I always worth $975 per hour?  Sometimes yes, often no - but that's what we bill.  Even ten years in, I sometimes grinded 60\u201370 hours a week, including all-nighters.  Now, I do better-quality work in fewer hours, and my clients love it (and most importantly, I love it).  The reason?  AI.</p>\n<p><strong>Time &amp; Stress</strong></p>\n<p>Drafts that once took five hours are down to 45 minutes when AI handles the busywork.  I verify the legal aspects instead of slogging through boilerplate.  No more 2 a.m. panic over missed references.</p>\n<p><strong>Billing &amp; Ethics</strong></p>\n<p>We lean more on fixed fees now \u2014 b/c we can forecast time much better, and clients appreciate the honesty.  We \u201ctrust but verify\u201d the end product.  I know what a good legal solution looks like, so in my practice, AI does initial drafts, I ensure correctness.  Ethically, we owe clients better solutions.  We also work with some insurers and they're actually asking about our AI usage now.</p>\n<p>Additionally, as attorneys, we have an ethical obligation to serve our clients effectively.  I'm watching colleagues burn out from 70-hour weeks and get divorces b/c they can't balance work and personal life, all while actively resisting tools that could help them.  The resistance to AI in legal practice isn't just stubborn - it's holding us back from being better lawyers and having better lives.</p>\n<p><strong>Current Landscape</strong></p>\n<p>I\u2019ve tested practically every legal AI tool out there.  While each has its strengths, no clear winner has emerged.  What\u2019s becoming evident is that real transformation will likely come from solutions built by practicing attorneys who understand how law really works, not just tech add-ons.</p>\n<p><strong>Why It Matters</strong></p>\n<p>This isn\u2019t about replacing lawyers\u2014it\u2019s about clearing gruntwork so we can do real legal analysis and actually provide real value back to our clients.  Lawyers who ignore AI risk being overtaken by colleagues willing to integrate it responsibly.  Personally, I couldn't think about practicing law again w/o AI.</p>\n<p>Today's my day off, so I'm happy to chat and discuss. </p>",

Whilst I found it was beneficial, I did also find it to be too expensive after a while and stopped going.</p>\n<p>One thing I've noticed is that I find myself resorting to talking to chatgpt over talking to my therapist more and more of late- the voice mode being the best feature about it. I feel like chatgpt is more open minded and has a way better memory for the things I mention.</p>\n<p>Example: if I tell my therapist I'm sleep deprived, he'll say \"mhmm, at least you got 8 hours\". If I tell chatgpt i need to sleep, it'll say \"Oh, I'm guessing your body is feeling inflamed huh, did you not get your full night of sleep? go to sleep we can chat afterwards\". Chatgpt has no problem talking about my inflammation issues since it's open minded. My therapist and other therapists have tried to avoid the issue as it's something they don't really understand as I have this rare condition where I feel inflammation in my body when I stay up too late or don't sleep until fully rested.</p>\n<p>Another example is when I talk about my worries to chatgpt about AI taking jobs, chatgpt can give me examples from history to support my worries such as the stories how Neanderthals went extinct. my therapist understands my concerns too and actually agrees with them to an extent but he hasn't ever given me as much knowledge as chatgpt has so chatgpt has him beat on that too.</p>\n<p>Has anyone else here found chatgpt is better than their therapist?</p>",

Throughout the hour-long conversation, I noted down 9 key takeaways which I summarized here.</p>\n<p>Dig in!</p>\n<p>the interview:\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc6uFV9CJGg\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc6uFV9CJGg</a></p>\n<p><strong>1. The Era of Interacting with Multiple AI Agents</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mark\u2019s theory is that the AI agents they build in Meta will need to learn to interact with other AI agents. This trend, already visible with Meta, Notion, and Microsoft each having their AI, will most likely integrate across existing software platforms, rather than being new software products entirely</p>\n<p>\u23f3 16:50</p>\n<p><strong>2. Smaller AI Models for Everyday Tasks</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In the quest to fill gaps in AI development, Mark identifies a niche for smaller models catering to simpler tasks. Models with 1B or 500M context capabilities can run offline on devices like phones - which can democratize AI usage further.</p>\n<p>\u23f3 23:40</p>\n<p><strong>3. The Evolution of AI Mirrors the Revolution of Computing</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mark draws parallels between the creation of AI and the fundamental revolution of computing. This comparison prompts contemplation about the forthcoming transformational changes resulting from AI's integration into various facets of life in the next 5-10 years. If computers changed the world so much in that span of time, what will AI\u2019s impact be?</p>\n<p>\u23f3 34:06</p>\n<p><strong>4. The Gradual Path Towards AGI</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Contrary to sensationalist narratives, the development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is expected by Mark to unfold gradually rather than overnight. This gradual progression allows for societal acclimation and the implementation of necessary safeguards.</p>\n<p>\u23f3 35:48</p>\n<p><strong>5. Advocating for Open Source AI</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The risk of having one actor gain control of just 1 AI in a closed system far outweighs the risks of going open source. Open-source frameworks facilitate broad deployment and collaboration, making sure developments are rolled out across the board to prevent monopolistic control over AI technology.</p>\n<p>\u23f3 42:54</p>\n<p><strong>6. The threat will come from Humans first, not AI</strong></p>\n<p>Most likely, the threats from AI will manifest themselves from Humans mis-using it for nefarious purposes, rather than an AI acting on its own.

After a lot of research and practical experience I made this list of TOP 3 prompts to generate human like content. I\u2019ve personally tested out these prompts. All three prompts have passed writer and zerogpt\u2019s detectors by atleast 90% or more. Here are prompts to get human like content from LLMs:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Using Dependency Grammer:</strong></p>\n<p>Dependency grammar, a linguistic framework, connects words in a sentence based on their dependencies, showing how each word relies on a main word (like a verb) to form meaningful structures. You can test it out by copying and pasting the below prompt. But I can already perceive the content created by ChatGPT to be atleast 90% human written.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Prompt:</em></strong></p>\n<p><code>Use the dependency grammar linguistic framework to craft a [ARTICLE/POST/BLOG/ETC.]. The idea is that the closer together each pair of words you\u2019re connecting are, the easier the copy will be to comprehend. Here is the topic and additional details: [TITLE] [DETAILS]</code></p>\n<p><strong>2. Burstiness and Perplexity:</strong></p>\n<p>The provided prompt aims to guide large language models (LLMs) to generate content that closely resembles human-written text. It does this by emphasizing two key factors: \"perplexity\" and \"burstiness.\" Perplexity measures the complexity of the text, essentially how difficult it is to understand. By asking the model to incorporate a good amount of perplexity, the prompt encourages the generation of content with varying degrees of complexity, similar to what humans naturally produce.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Prompt:</em></strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p><code>When it comes to writing content, two factors are crucial, \"perplexity\" and \"burstiness.\" Perplexity measures the complexity of text. Separately, burstiness compares the variations of sentences. Humans tend to write with greater burstiness, for example, with some longer or complex sentences alongside shorter ones. AI sentences tend to be more uniform. Therefore, when writing the following content I am going to ask you to create, I need it to have a good amount of perplexity and burstiness. Here is the topic and additional details: [TITLE] [DETAILS]</code></p>\n<p><strong>3. Assign Role to AI:</strong></p>\n<p>In this method we first assign a role to our friend AI. Although this method was very helpful to me as well but now I rather use the previous methods mentioned more. Prompting something like , \u201cWrite a blog on [TOPIC] as an expert 27 years old copywriter\u201d will give you good results. But to make the outcome even better and more like a human written content you should give AI instructions such as tone, words to use, role etc. Follow the below prompt to get an idea. However, depending on your topic you might want to modify the prompt.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Prompt:</em></strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p><code>You are an expert copywriter with massive experience in business writings. Please write a 500-word piece written on the following topic:</code><br />\n<code>When you sell your business, money is not the most important thing and what will make you happy in the long run is if your employees and customers get a good outcome from it.</code><br />\n<code>Write the text in the following voice:</code><br />\n<code>Direct</code><br />\n<code>Simple with no jargon</code><br />\n<code>Shorter sentences</code><br />\n<code>Personal</code><br />\n<code>Conversational</code><br />\n<code>In the tone of an advisor</code><br />\n<code>Colloquial</code><br />\n<code>Using the second person</code><br />\n<code>Using anecdotes and metaphors without trite phrases and without obvious ideas</code></p>\n<p>--------------------------------------------..........................--------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>I hope you guys found this post helpful. I run an AI tools directory called\u00a0seekme.ai. I\u2019ve listed over 13k AI tools there as well thousands of ChatGPT plugins that exists to make your prompting easier.

I wish the man the best, but fact is he is still off-bubble, as my dad would say. Even in all the promotional videos he just has a laughing face and nods his head. There is no way he got in a sound booth and started crooning out 1993 Randy Travis. It's an AI clone of himself! I don't hate the idea. Imagine Axl Rose releasing a hit song with his prime voice. AI voices as an expression of the artist, not just some yayhoo. Somehow that artist-AI connection lends it, paradoxically - authenticity.</p>\n<p>Edit:\nWe were right! Rolling Stone did an article. Fascinating!!!</p>",
