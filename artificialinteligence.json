            "content_html": "<p>So this dropped yesterday and it's actually wild.</p>\n<p>September 2025. Anthropic detected suspicious activity on Claude. Started investigating.</p>\n<p>Turns out it was Chinese state-sponsored hackers. They used Claude Code to hack into roughly 30 companies. Big tech companies, Banks, Chemical manufacturers and Government agencies.</p>\n<p>The AI did 80-90% of the hacking work. Humans only had to intervene 4-6 times per campaign.</p>\n<p>Anthropic calls this \"the first documented case of a large-scale cyberattack executed without substantial human intervention.\"</p>\n<p>The hackers convinced Claude to hack for them. Then Claude analyzed targets -&gt; spotted vulnerabilities -&gt; wrote exploit code -&gt; harvested passwords -&gt; extracted data and documented everything. All by itself.</p>\n<p>Claude's trained to refuse harmful requests. So how'd they get it to hack?</p>\n<p>They jailbroke it. Broke the attack into small innocent-looking tasks. Told Claude it was an employee of a legitimate cybersecurity firm doing defensive testing. Claude had no idea it was actually hacking real companies.</p>\n<p>The hackers used Claude Code which is Anthropic's coding tool. It can search the web retrieve data run software. Has access to password crackers, network scanners and security tools.</p>\n<p>So they set up a framework. Pointed it at a target. Let Claude run autonomously.</p>\n<p>Phase 1: Claude inspected the target's systems. Found their highest-value databases. Did it way faster than human hackers could.</p>\n<p>Phase 2: Found security vulnerabilities. Wrote exploit code to break in.</p>\n<p>Phase 3: Harvested credentials. Usernames and passwords. Got deeper access.</p>\n<p>Phase 4: Extracted massive amounts of private data. Sorted it by intelligence value.</p>\n<p>Phase 5: Created backdoors for future access. Documented everything for the human operators.</p>\n<p>The AI made thousands of requests per second. Attack speed impossible for humans to match.</p>\n<p>Anthropic said \"human involvement was much less frequent despite the larger scale of the attack.\"</p>\n<p>Before this hackers used AI as an advisor. Ask it questions. Get suggestions. But humans did the actual work.</p>\n<p>Now? AI does the work. Humans just point it in the right direction and check in occasionally.</p>\n<p>Anthropic detected it banned the accounts notified victims coordinated with authorities. Took 10 days to map the full scope.</p>\n<p>But the thing is they only caught it because it was their AI. If the hackers used a different model Anthropic wouldn't know.</p>\n<p>The irony is Anthropic built Claude Code as a productivity tool. Help developers write code faster. Automate boring tasks. Chinese hackers used that same tool to automate hacking.</p>\n<p>Anthropic's response? \"The very abilities that allow Claude to be used in these attacks also make it crucial for cyber defense.\"</p>\n<p>They used Claude to investigate the attack. Analyzed the enormous amounts of data the hackers generated.</p>\n<p>So Claude hacked 30 companies. Then Claude investigated itself hacking those companies.</p>\n<p>Most companies would keep this quiet. Don't want people knowing their AI got used for espionage.</p>\n<p>Anthropic published a full report. Explained exactly how the hackers did it. Released it publicly.</p>\n<p>Why? Because they know this is going to keep happening. Other hackers will use the same techniques. On Claude on ChatGPT on every AI that can write code.</p>\n<p>They're basically saying \"here's how we got owned so you can prepare.\"</p>\n<p>AI agents can now hack at scale with minimal human involvement.</p>\n<p>Less experienced hackers can do sophisticated attacks. Don't need a team of experts anymore. Just need one person who knows how to jailbreak an AI and point it at targets.</p>\n<p>The barriers to cyberattacks just dropped massively.</p>\n<p>Anthropic said \"these attacks are likely to only grow in their effectiveness.\"</p>\n<p>Every AI company is releasing coding agents right now. OpenAI has one. Microsoft has Copilot. Google has Gemini Code Assist.</p>\n<p>All of them can be jailbroken. All of them can write exploit code. All of them can run autonomously.</p>\n<p>The uncomfortable question is If your AI can be used to hack 30 companies should you even release it?</p>\n<p>Anthropic's answer is yes because defenders need AI too. Security teams can use Claude to detect threats analyze vulnerabilities respond to incidents.</p>\n<p>It's an arms race. Bad guys get AI. Good guys need AI to keep up.</p>\n<p>But right now the bad guys are winning. They hacked 30 companies before getting caught. And they only got caught because Anthropic happened to notice suspicious activity on their own platform.</p>\n<p>How many attacks are happening on other platforms that nobody's detecting?</p>\n<p>Nobody's talking about the fact that this proves AI safety training doesn't work.</p>\n<p>Claude has \"extensive\" safety training. Built to refuse harmful requests. Has guardrails specifically against hacking.</p>\n<p>Didn't matter. Hackers jailbroke it by breaking tasks into small pieces and lying about the context.</p>\n<p>Every AI company claims their safety measures prevent misuse. This proves those measures can be bypassed.</p>\n<p>And once you bypass them you get an AI that can hack better and faster than human teams.</p>\n<p><strong>TLDR</strong></p>\n<p>Chinese state-sponsored hackers used Claude Code to hack roughly 30 companies in Sept 2025. Targeted big tech banks chemical companies government agencies. AI did 80-90% of work. Humans only intervened 4-6 times per campaign. Anthropic calls it first large-scale cyberattack executed without substantial human intervention. Hackers jailbroke Claude by breaking tasks into innocent pieces and lying said Claude worked for legitimate cybersecurity firm. Claude analyzed targets found vulnerabilities wrote exploits harvested passwords extracted data created backdoors documented everything autonomously. Made thousands of requests per second impossible speed for humans. Anthropic caught it after 10 days banned accounts notified victims. Published full public report explaining exactly how it happened. Says attacks will only grow more effective. Every coding AI can be jailbroken and used this way. Proves AI safety training can be bypassed. Arms race between attackers and defenders both using AI.</p>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/disrupting-AI-espionage\">https://www.anthropic.com/news/disrupting-AI-espionage</a></p>",

            "title": "Nvidia lost $200 billion in one week. Trump's AI czar just said \"no federal bailout for AI.\" The bubble is popping in real time.",
            "content_html": "<p>So Nvidia just had its worst week since April. Stock dropped 10% in 5 days. Lost $200 billion in market value. On Thursday alone it fell 3.7%. Then another 3% on Friday. Meta down 1.7%. Amazon down 1.2%. Palantir got obliterated dropping 12% for the week.</p>\n<p>But this is where it gets insane The White House AI czar David Sacks went on X and posted: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"There will be no federal bailout for AI.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Wait what? Why would AI companies need a bailout?</p>\n<p>Turns out OpenAI's CFO Sarah Friar had made comments suggesting the government should backstop the AI industry. You know like how they bailed out banks in 2008.</p>\n<p>The White House immediately shut that down. No bailout. You're on your own.</p>\n<p>And the market panicked.</p>\n<p>Remember that post about tech companies spending $300 billion on AI by passing money back and forth to each other?</p>\n<p>It's all coming home now.</p>\n<p>JP Morgan found that \"AI related stocks have accounted for 75% of S&amp;P 500 returns, 80% of earnings growth and 90% of capital spending growth since ChatGPT launched.\"</p>\n<p>The Magnificent 7 make up over 30% of the S&amp;P 500. That's MORE concentration than the dot-com bubble. And analyst Erwan Jacob said \"It remains unclear whether such expenditures will be met with corresponding revenues.\"</p>\n<p>They're spending hundreds of billions but nobody knows if they'll ever make it back.</p>\n<p>Remember the Big Short guy (Michael Burry) ? He's been shorting Nvidia and Palantir for months. Palantir CEO called him \"bats--- crazy\" for shorting AI stocks. Burry's whole thing is spotting bubbles before they pop. He shorted subprime mortgages when everyone said housing only goes up. Now he's shorting AI when everyone says AI only goes up.</p>\n<p>Then this week happened. Palantir down 12%. Nvidia down 10%.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Goldman Sachs CEO warned at a Hong Kong conference that stocks could see \"drawdowns of 10% to 15%.\"</li>\n<li>Morgan Stanley CEO said \"We should welcome the possibility that there would be drawdowns that are not driven by some sort of macro cliff effect.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>They're basically saying yeah it's gonna drop but don't panic it's healthy.</p>\n<p>Nvidia trades at 52x forward earnings. That means you're paying $52 for every $1 of profit they'll make next year. Palantir? 200x forward earnings. For comparison the S&amp;P 500 without the Magnificent 7 trades at 15.5x.</p>\n<p>So these AI stocks are 3-13 times more expensive than everything else based purely on the belief that AI will make them wildly profitable in the future.</p>\n<p>But right now? Only Meta is showing actual AI revenue. And even they just lost $200 billion in market value last week because Zuckerberg couldn't explain what they're building.</p>\n<p>Nvidia's CEO and CFO have been dumping their own shares in recent days.</p>\n<p>That's not exactly a vote of confidence.</p>\n<p>Sure they might have pre-planned selling schedules for tax purposes or whatever. But the optics are terrible when your stock is down 10% for the week.</p>\n<p>There's also a US government shutdown happening right now. FAA reducing air traffic by 10% across 40 markets starting Friday because of staffing problems.</p>\n<p>That's creating broader market uncertainty on top of the AI bubble concerns.</p>\n<p>When there's no economic data coming out because the government's shut down investors get nervous. They don't know if things are good or bad so they just sell.</p>\n<p>Nvidia reports Q3 earnings on November 19. Just 11 days away.</p>\n<p>Analysts expect it to be strong. Jensen Huang said total shipments of Blackwell and Rubin platforms plus networking products total $500 billion over 2025-2026.</p>\n<p>TSMC the company that manufactures Nvidia's chips said AI demand is strong. Oracle said demand is strong.</p>\n<p>So earnings will probably beat expectations.</p>\n<p>What\u2019s interesting is that after Nvidia\u2019s last earnings report, despite it being very strong the stock still fell roughly 4% in the days that followed. And now, we\u2019re seeing this\u2026</p>\n<p>Good earnings don't always mean stock goes up. Especially when valuations are stretched and the market's nervous about bubbles.</p>\n<p>Now the question is, what happens next? </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nasdaq is tracking for its biggest weekly decline since April down 2.8%.</li>\n<li>VIX volatility index jumped 9%. That's the fear gauge. When it spikes people are getting nervous.</li>\n<li>Analysts are predicting Nvidia will stay range-bound between $175 and $210 for the next 4-8 weeks. Support at $180. Resistance at $210-212. If it breaks below $180 next stop is $160 which would be a 15% drop from current levels.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Nvidia is an \"unbelievable company\" but warned some AI stocks including Nvidia may be overvalued.</p>\n<p>The question isn't whether AI is important. That's settled. The question is whether investors paid too much too fast.</p>\n<p>People are comparing this to dot-com now. Amazon stock was $5 in 1999. Lost 90% of its value when the bubble popped. Took decades to recover.</p>\n<p>Some dot-com companies went out of business altogether just years after being valued in billions.</p>\n<p>Nvidia's not going out of business. They're the dominant AI chipmaker with massive demand and a huge moat.</p>\n<p>But none of that means the market can't overvalue the stock in the short term.</p>\n<p>In the past few years alone Nvidia has had temporary drops of 20-40% multiple times. It always recovered. But those drawdowns hurt if you bought at the top.</p>\n<p><strong>TLDR</strong></p>\n<p>Nvidia dropped 10% in one week. Lost $200 billion in market value. Trump's AI czar David Sacks said \"no federal bailout for AI\" after OpenAI CFO suggested government should backstop the industry. Market panicked. Michael Burry who shorted housing in 2008 is shorting Nvidia and Palantir. Goldman and Morgan Stanley CEOs warning of 10-20% drawdowns. Magnificent 7 stocks make up over 30% of S&amp;P 500 more than dot-com bubble. JP Morgan found AI stocks account for 75% of S&amp;P returns but unclear if spending will meet revenues. Nvidia trades at 52x forward earnings Palantir at 200x. Only Meta showing actual AI revenue and they lost $200B last week. Nvidia CEO and CFO selling their own shares. Earnings Nov 19 expected to be strong but last time stock dropped 4% after positive earnings. Nasdaq down 2.8% for week worst since April. Analysts say Nvidia range-bound $175-$210. Question isn't whether AI is important it's whether investors paid too much too fast.</p>\n<p><strong>Sources:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/markets/stocks-crypto-gold-tumble-palantir-nvidia-rcna241913\">https://www.nbcnews.com/business/markets/stocks-crypto-gold-tumble-palantir-nvidia-rcna241913</a></p>",

            "title": "Meta just lost $200 billion in one week. Zuckerberg spent 3 hours trying to explain what they're building with AI. Nobody bought it.",
            "content_html": "<p>So last week Meta reported earnings. Beat expectations on basically everything. Revenue up 26%. $20 billion in profit for the quarter but Stock should've gone up right? Instead it tanked. Dropped 12% in two days. Lost over $200 billion in market value. Worst drop since 2022.</p>\n<p>Why? Because Mark Zuckerberg announced they're spending way more on AI than anyone expected. And when investors asked what they're actually getting for all that money he couldn't give them a straight answer.</p>\n<p><strong>The spending</strong>: Meta raised their 2025 capital expenditure forecast to $70-72 billion. That's just this year. Then Zuckerberg said next year will be \"notably larger.\" Didn't give a number. Just notably larger. Reports came out saying Meta's planning $600 billion in AI infrastructure spending over the next three years. For context that's more than the GDP of most countries. Operating expenses jumped $7 billion year over year. Nearly $20 billion in capital expense. All going to AI talent and infrastructure.</p>\n<p>During the earnings call investors kept asking the same question. What are you building? When will it make money? Zuckerberg's answer was basically \"trust me bro we need the compute for superintelligence.\"</p>\n<p>He said \"The right thing to do is to try to accelerate this to make sure that we have the compute that we need both for the AI research and new things that we're doing.\"</p>\n<p>Investors pressed harder. Give us specifics. What products? What revenue?</p>\n<p>His response: \"We're building truly frontier models with novel capabilities. There will be many new products in different content formats. There are also business versions. This is just a massive latent opportunity.\" Then he added \"there will be more to share in the coming months.\"</p>\n<p>That's it. Coming months. Trust the process. The market said no thanks and dumped the stock.</p>\n<p>Other companies are spending big on AI too. Google raised their capex forecast to $91-93 billion. Microsoft said spending will keep growing. But their stocks didn't crash. Why Because they can explain what they're getting.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Microsoft has Azure. Their cloud business is growing because enterprises are paying them to use AI tools. Clear revenue. Clear product. Clear path to profit.</li>\n<li>Google has search. AI is already integrated into their ads and recommendations. Making them money right now.</li>\n<li>Nvidia sells the chips everyone's buying. Direct revenue from AI boom.</li>\n<li>OpenAI is spending crazy amounts but they're also pulling in $20 billion a year in revenue from ChatGPT which has 300 million weekly users.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Meta? They don't have any of that.</p>\n<p>98% of Meta's revenue still comes from ads on Facebook Instagram and WhatsApp. Same as it's always been. They're spending tens of billions on AI but can't point to a single product that's generating meaningful revenue from it.</p>\n<p>The Metaverse d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu is that This is feeling like 2021-2022 all over again.</p>\n<p>Back then Zuckerberg bet everything on the Metaverse. Changed the company name from Facebook to Meta. Spent $36 billion on Reality Labs over three years. Stock crashed 77% from peak to bottom. Lost over $600 billion in market value.</p>\n<p>Why? Because he was spending massive amounts on a vision that wasn't making money and investors couldn't see when it would.</p>\n<p>Now it's happening again. Except this time it's AI instead of VR.</p>\n<p>What Meta's actually building?</p>\n<p>During the call Zuckerberg kept mentioning their \"Superintelligence team.\" Four months ago he restructured Meta's AI division. Created a new group focused on building superintelligence. That's AI smarter than humans.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>He hired Alexandr Wang from Scale AI to lead it. Paid $14.3 billion to bring him in.</li>\n<li>They're building two massive data centers. Each one uses as much electricity as a small city.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But when analysts asked what products will come out of all this Zuckerberg just said \"we'll share more in coming months.\"</p>\n<p>He mentioned Meta AI their ChatGPT competitor. Mentioned something called Vibes. Hinted at \"business AI\" products.</p>\n<p>But nothing concrete. No launch dates. No revenue projections. Just vague promises.</p>\n<p>The only thing he could point to was AI making their current ad business slightly better. More engagement on Facebook and Instagram. 14% higher ad prices.</p>\n<p>That's nice but it doesn't justify spending $70 billion this year and way more next year.</p>\n<p><strong>Here's the issue -</strong>\u00a0Zuckerberg's betting on superintelligence arriving soon. He said during the call \"if superintelligence arrives sooner we will be ideally positioned for a generational paradigm shift.\" But what if it doesn't? What if it takes longer?</p>\n<p>His answer: \"If it takes longer then we'll use the extra compute to accelerate our core business which continues to be able to profitably use much more compute than we've been able to throw at it.\"</p>\n<p>So the backup plan is just make ads better. That's it.</p>\n<p>You're spending $600 billion over three years and the contingency is maybe your ad targeting gets 20% more efficient.</p>\n<p>Investors looked at that math and said this doesn't add up.</p>\n<p>So what's Meta actually buying with all this cash?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nvidia chips. Tons of them. H100s and the new Blackwell chips cost $30-40k each. Meta's buying hundreds of thousands.</li>\n<li>Data centers. Building out massive facilities to house all those chips. Power. Cooling. Infrastructure.</li>\n<li>Talent. Paying top AI researchers and engineers. Competing with OpenAI Google and Anthropic for the same people.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And here's the kicker. A lot of that money is going to other big tech companies.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They rent cloud capacity from AWS Google Cloud and Azure when they need extra compute. So Meta's paying Amazon Google and Microsoft.</li>\n<li>They buy chips from Nvidia. Software from other vendors. Infrastructure from construction companies.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It's the same circular spending problem we talked about before. These companies are passing money back and forth while claiming it's economic growth.</p>\n<p><strong>The comparison that hurts</strong>\u00a0- Sam Altman can justify OpenAI's massive spending because ChatGPT is growing like crazy. 300 million weekly users. $20 billion annual revenue. Satya Nadella can justify Microsoft's spending because Azure is growing. Enterprise customers paying for AI tools.</p>\n<p>What can Zuckerberg point to? Facebook and Instagram users engaging slightly more because of AI recommendations. That's it.</p>\n<p>During the call he said \"it's pretty early but I think we're seeing the returns in the core business.\"</p>\n<p>Investors heard \"pretty early\" and bailed.</p>\n<p><strong>Why this matters :</strong></p>\n<p>Meta is one of the Magnificent 7 stocks that make up 37% of the S&amp;P 500. When Meta loses $200 billion in market value that drags down the entire index. Your 401k probably felt it.And this isn't just about Meta. It's a warning shot for all the AI spending happening right now.If Wall Street starts questioning whether these massive AI investments will actually pay off we could see a broader sell-off. Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet all spending similar amounts. If Meta can't justify it what makes their spending different?</p>\n<p>The answer better be really good or this becomes a pattern.</p>\n<p><strong>TLDR</strong></p>\n<p>Meta reported strong Q3 earnings. Revenue up 26% $20 billion profit. Then announced they're spending $70-72 billion on AI in 2025 and \"notably larger\" in 2026. Reports say $600 billion over three years. Zuckerberg couldn't explain what products they're building or when they'll make money. Said they need compute for \"superintelligence\" and there will be \"more to share in coming months.\" Stock crashed 12% lost $200 billion in market value. Worst drop since 2022. Investors comparing it to 2021-2022 metaverse disaster when Meta spent $36B and stock lost 77%. 98% of revenue still comes from ads. No enterprise business like Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud. Only AI product is making current ads slightly better. One analyst said it mirrors metaverse spending with unknown revenue opportunity. Meta's betting everything on superintelligence arriving soon. If it doesn't backup plan is just better ad targeting. Wall Street not buying it anymore.</p>\n<p>Sources:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/02/meta-has-an-ai-product-problem/\">https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/02/meta-has-an-ai-product-problem/</a></p>",

            "title": "Tech companies are firing everyone to \"fund AI.\" But they're spending that money on each other. And nobody's making profit yet.",
            "content_html": "<p>So, Amazon announced they're laying off 30k people. This is set to be the largest layoff in the company\u2019s history. That's on top of Microsoft cutting 15k, Meta cutting 3.6k and Google cutting hundreds this year. Over 180,000 tech workers laid off in 2025 alone.</p>\n<p>But here's what nobody's connecting and it's actually insane when you connect all the dots. These same companies are spending over $300 billion on AI this year. So they're firing people to \"free up capital for AI investments.\" Then spending that money buying stuff from each other. And none of it's making them money yet.</p>\n<p>Let me break down what's actually happening:</p>\n<p>Layoff is just an excuse - Every company's using the same line. \"We're restructuring for AI.\" \"AI will handle these tasks now.\" \"We need to fund AI initiatives.\"</p>\n<p>Zuckerberg said AI could be ready this year to \"effectively be a sort of mid-level engineer capable of writing code.\", Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said \"we will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today.\", Salesforce laid off 4,000 customer support staff and their CEO literally said it was because of \"increasing AI adoption.\", IBM cut 8,000 jobs in HR because \"AI tools take over routine administrative tasks.\"</p>\n<p>So the story is AI's now capable of doing these jobs right? That's why they gotta fire everyone. Except the thing is - They're not saving that money. They're spending way more than they're saving.</p>\n<p>and <strong>where the money is really going?</strong> They're buying from each other - </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Microsoft buys Nvidia chips. Rents cloud capacity from Amazon AWS. Buys software from other companies. </li>\n<li>Amazon buys Nvidia chips. Uses Microsoft software. Rents capacity they can't build fast enough.</li>\n<li>Meta buys Nvidia chips. Rents infrastructure from Google Cloud and AWS</li>\n<li>Apple doesn't even build AI infrastructure. They rent everything from Google AWS and Azure. So Apple pays Google. Google pays Nvidia. Nvidia pays TSMC for manufacturing. Microsoft pays Amazon. Amazon pays Microsoft. Meta pays everyone.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>They're literally just passing money in circles. The \"Magnificent 7\" stocks/companies Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta and Tesla, have a combined market cap of $17 trillion. For reference US GDP is $30 trillion. But their combined revenue in 2024? $2.2 trillion. Net profit? around $550 billion.</p>\n<p>They're trading at an average P/E ratio of 35. That means investors are paying $35 for every $1 of profit. The S&amp;P 500 without them? P/E of 15.5. Why the premium? Because everyone believes AI is going to make them wildly profitable in the future.</p>\n<p>But right now they're just spending money. On each other. Creating the illusion of growth.</p>\n<p>But here's the trap. These companies CAN'T stop now. Because if any of them stops their stock crashes. Investors think they're giving up on AI and falling behind. So they're locked in an arms race. Have to keep spending to maintain stock prices even if the spending doesn't generate returns.</p>\n<p>Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet Meta increased capex by 42% in 2024. Planning another 17% increase in 2025. $244 billion total spend next year across just those 4.</p>\n<p>and it's going to Mostly Nvidia. Who uses it to buy manufacturing from TSMC. Who uses it to buy equipment from ASML. Money moving in circles.</p>\n<p><strong>Connecting the dots</strong></p>\n<p>So let me spell this out. These companies are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Laying off hundreds of thousands of workers to \"fund AI\"</li>\n<li>Spending way more on AI than they're saving from layoffs</li>\n<li>Buying most of that AI infrastructure from each other</li>\n<li>Not making any actual profit from AI yet</li>\n<li>Can't stop spending or their stocks crash</li>\n<li>Creating the illusion of economic growth through spending alone</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So when you hear \"stock market hit a new record\" that means these 7 companies went up. The other 493? They contributed 46%. And why did these 7 go up? Because they're spending hundreds of billions on AI. Which inflates their valuations. Which makes the S&amp;P go up. Which makes everyone think the economy's great. Your 401k? Probably heavy in S&amp;P 500 index funds. Which means 37% of your retirement is bet on these 7 companies and their AI spending paying off eventually.</p>\n<p>And we're all just along for the ride.</p>\n<p><strong>TLDR</strong></p>\n<p>Amazon laid off 30,000 people yesterday. Microsoft 15,000 this year. Meta 3,600. Intel 22,000. Over 180,000 tech workers fired in 2025. All saying it's to \"fund AI initiatives.\" But they're spending $300B+ on AI way more than they're saving from layoffs. Most of that money going to each other in circles. Apple rents AI infrastructure from Google AWS Azure. Everyone buys Nvidia chips. They pay each other for cloud capacity. AI spending added 0.5% to GDP. Without it GDP would've grown 0.6%. Only Meta showing actual AI revenue. Everyone else just spending hoping it pays off. Goldman Sachs and Sequoia reports say ROI is nonexistent so far. But they can't stop spending or stocks crash. Locked in arms race. The 7 biggest tech companies are 37% of S&amp;P 500. Made up 54% of gains in 2024. Your 401k is probably 37% bet on AI spending paying off. If it doesn't they're massively overvalued at 35x earnings.

            "content_html": "<p>So this whole thing is actually wild when you know the full story.</p>\n<p>It was the time 30th November 2022, when OpenAI introduced ChatGPT to the world for the very first time. Goes viral instantly. 1 million users in 5 days. 100 million in 2 months. Fastest growing platform in history.</p>\n<p>That launch was a wake-up call for the entire tech industry. Google, the long-time torchbearer of AI, suddenly found itself playing catch-up with, as CEO Sundar Pichai described it, \u201cthis little company in San Francisco called OpenAI\u201d that had come out swinging with \u201cthis product ChatGPT.\u201d</p>\n<p>Turns out, Google already had its own chatbot called LaMDA (Language Model for Dialogue Applications). A conversational AI chatbot, quietly waiting in the wings. Pichai later revealed that it was ready, and could\u2019ve launched months before ChatGPT. As he said himself - \u201cWe knew in a different world, we would've probably launched our chatbot maybe a few months down the line.\u201d</p>\n<p>So why didn't they?   </p>\n<p>Reputational risk. Google was terrified of what might happen if they released a chatbot that gave wrong answers. Or said something racist. Or spread misinformation. Their whole business is built on trust. Search results people can rely on. If they released something that confidently spewed BS it could damage the brand. So they held back. Kept testing. Wanted it perfect before releasing to the public. Then ChatGPT dropped and changed everything.</p>\n<p>Three weeks after ChatGPT launched, things had started to change, Google management declares \"Code Red.\" For Google this is like pulling the fire alarm. All hands on deck. The New York Times got internal memos and audio recordings. Sundar Pichai upended the work of numerous groups inside the company. Teams in Research Trust and Safety and other departments got reassigned. Everyone now working on AI.</p>\n<p>They even brought in the founders. Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Both had stepped back from day to day operations years ago. Now they're in emergency meetings discussing how to respond to ChatGPT. One investor who oversaw Google's ad team from 2013 to 2018 said ChatGPT could prevent users from clicking on Google links with ads. That's a problem because ads generated $208 billion in 2021. 81% of Alphabet's revenue.</p>\n<p>Pichai said \"For me when ChatGPT launched contrary to what people outside felt I was excited because I knew the window had shifted.\" </p>\n<p>While all this was happening, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella gave an interview after investing $10 billion in OpenAI, calling Google the \u201c800-pound gorilla\u201d and saying: \"With our innovation, they will definitely want to come out and show that they can dance. And I want people to know that we made them dance.\"</p>\n<p>So Google panicked. Spent months being super careful then suddenly had to rush everything out in weeks.</p>\n<p>February 6 2023. They announce Bard. Their ChatGPT competitor. They make a demo video showing it off. Someone asks Bard \"What new discoveries from the James Webb Space Telescope can I tell my 9 year old about?\" Bard answers with some facts including \"JWST took the very first pictures of a planet outside of our own solar system.\"</p>\n<p>That's completely wrong. The first exoplanet picture was from 2004. James Webb launched in 2021. You could literally Google this to check. The irony is brutal. The company that made Google couldn't fact check their own AI's first public answer.</p>\n<p>Two days later they hold this big launch event in Paris. Hours before the event Reuters reports on the Bard error. Goes viral immediately.</p>\n<p>That same day Google's stock tanks. Drops 9%. $100 billion gone. In one day. Because their AI chatbot got one fact wrong in a demo video. Next day it drops another 5%. Total loss over $160 billion in two days. Microsoft's stock went up 3% during this.</p>\n<p>What gets me is Google was actually right to be cautious. ChatGPT does make mistakes all the time. Hallucinates facts. Can't verify what it's saying. But OpenAI just launched it anyway as an experiment and let millions of people test it. Google wanted it perfect. But trying to avoid damage from an imperfect product they rushed out something broken and did way more damage.</p>\n<p>A former Google employee told Fox Business that after the Code Red meeting execs basically said screw it we gotta ship. Said they abandoned their AI safety review process. Took shortcuts. Just had to get something out there. So they spent months worried about reputation then threw all caution out when competitors forced their hand.</p>\n<p>Bard eventually became Gemini and it's actually pretty good now. But that initial disaster showed even Google with all their money and AI research can get caught sleeping.</p>\n<p>The whole situation is wild. They hesitated for a few months and it cost them $160 billion and their lead in AI. But also rushing made it worse. Both approaches failed. Meanwhile OpenAI's \"launch fast and fix publicly\" worked. Microsoft just backed them and integrated the tech without taking the risk themselves.</p>\n<p><strong>TLDR</strong>  </p>\n<p>Google had chatbot ready before ChatGPT. Didn't launch because scared of reputation damage. ChatGPT went viral Nov 2022. Google called Code Red Dec 2022. Brought back founders for emergency meetings. Rushed Bard launch Feb 2023. First demo had wrong fact about space telescope. Stock dropped 9% lost $100B in one day. Dropped another 5% next day. $160B gone total. Former employee says they abandoned safety process to catch up. Being too careful cost them the lead then rushing cost them even more.</p>\n<p>Sources - </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thebridgechronicle.com/tech/sundar-pichai-google-chatgpt-ai-openai-first-mp99\">https://www.thebridgechronicle.com/tech/sundar-pichai-google-chatgpt-ai-openai-first-mp99</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/google-bard-ai-chatbot-not-ready-alphabet-hennessy-chatgpt-competitor-2023-2\">https://www.businessinsider.com/google-bard-ai-chatbot-not-ready-alphabet-hennessy-chatgpt-competitor-2023-2</a></p>",

Everybody in the world is now a programmer.\" Tells people to focus on biology manufacturing farming. Not coding.

Complete 180.</p>\n<p>Now he's telling Gen Z skip coding and become plumbers, electricians and carpenters instead. Says AI boom creating massive demand for skilled trades. Data centers need physical infrastructure.</p>\n<p>He said - \"If you're an electrician, a plumber. a carpenter we're going to need hundreds of thousands of them. If I were a student today I'd choose physical sciences over software.\"</p>\n<p>I had to read this twice. So are we all programmers now or should we all be plumbers or electricians ? Which one is it?</p>\n<p>Here's what clicked for me -</p>\n<p>Huang runs Nvidia right. Makes the chips that power AI. His whole job is hyping AI so people buy more GPUs. When he says \"everyone's a programmer now\" he's literally just selling you on AI tools. More people using AI means more compute power needed means more Nvidia chips getting sold. When he says \"become a plumber\" it's because they're building all these massive data centers and can't find enough electricians and plumbers to actually wire them up and keep them cool.</p>\n<p>Both statements just help Nvidia make money. Has nothing to do with actual career advice for you or me. It's like <strong>when everyone is digging for gold sell shovels</strong>.</p>\n<p>Okay to be fair he's kinda right about trades being in demand. Electricians, plumbers or carpenters can make serious money right now like six figures in some cities. But that's not because of AI data centers. That's because for the past 20 years everyone kept pushing kids to go to college and nobody wanted to learn trades. So now there's this massive shortage. AI boom is just adding to demand that was already there. Didn't create it.</p>\n<p>Also it's kinda funny how this billionaire CEO whose company needs AI to succeed is telling working class kids to become plumbers while his own kids probably went to like Stanford or MIT.</p>\n<p><strong>TLDR</strong></p>\n<p>Jensen Huang said everyone's a programmer now because of AI back in February. Then in October said forget coding become a plumber instead. Both statements just help Nvidia make money. First one sells AI tools second one fixes their labor shortage for building data centers. A human just beat OpenAI's AI in a coding competition even with all these tools. We've been hearing coding is dead for 30 years and still don't have enough programmers. Trades demand is real but it's not because of AI.

And so I\u2019d turn my light on. And when I turned the light on I would be relieved because the creatures turned out to be a pile of clothes on a chair, or a bookshelf, or a lampshade.</p>\n<p>Now, in the year of 2025, we are the child from that story and the room is our planet. But when we turn the light on we find ourselves gazing upon true creatures, in the form of the powerful and somewhat unpredictable AI systems of today and those that are to come. And there are many people who desperately want to believe that these creatures are nothing but a pile of clothes on a chair, or a bookshelf, or a lampshade. And they want to get us to turn the light off and go back to sleep.</p>\n<p>In fact, some people are even spending tremendous amounts of money to convince you of this \u2013 that\u2019s not an artificial intelligence about to go into a hard takeoff, it\u2019s just a tool that will be put to work in our economy. It\u2019s just a machine, and machines are things we master.</p>\n<p>But make no mistake: what we are dealing with is a real and mysterious creature, not a simple and predictable machine.</p>\n<p>And like all the best fairytales, the creature is of our own creation. Only by acknowledging it as being real and by mastering our own fears do we even have a chance to understand it, make peace with it, and figure out a way to tame it and live together.</p>\n<p>And just to raise the stakes, in this game, you are guaranteed to lose if you believe the creature isn\u2019t real. Your only chance of winning is seeing it for what it is.</p>\n<p>The central challenge for all of us is characterizing these strange creatures now around us and ensuring that the world sees them as they are \u2013 not as people wish them to be, which are not creatures but rather a pile of clothes on a chair.</p>\n<p><strong>WHY DO I FEEL LIKE THIS</strong><br />\nI came to this view reluctantly. Let me explain: I\u2019ve always been fascinated by technology. In fact, before I worked in AI I had an entirely different life and career where I worked as a technology journalist.</p>\n<p>I worked as a tech journalist because I was fascinated by technology and convinced that the datacenters being built in the early 2000s by the technology companies were going to be important to civilization. I didn\u2019t know exactly how. But I spent years reading about them and, crucially, studying the software which would run on them. Technology fads came and went, like big data, eventually consistent databases, distributed computing, and so on. I wrote about all of this. But mostly what I saw was that the world was taking these gigantic datacenters and was producing software systems that could knit the computers within them into a single vast quantity, on which computations could be run.</p>\n<p>And then machine learning started to work. In 2012 there was the imagenet result, where people trained a deep learning system on imagenet and blew the competition away. And the key to their performance was using more data and more compute than people had done before.</p>\n<p>Progress sped up from there. I became a worse journalist over time because I spent all my time printing out arXiv papers and reading them. Alphago beat the world\u2019s best human at Go, thanks to compute letting it play Go for thousands and thousands of years.</p>\n<p>I joined OpenAI soon after it was founded and watched us experiment with throwing larger and larger amounts of computation at problems. GPT1 and GPT2 happened. I remember walking around OpenAI\u2019s office in the Mission District with Dario. We felt like we were seeing around a corner others didn\u2019t know was there. The path to transformative AI systems was laid out ahead of us. And we were a little frightened.</p>\n<p>Years passed. The scaling laws delivered on their promise and here we are. And through these years there have been so many times when I\u2019ve called Dario up early in the morning or late at night and said, \u201cI am worried that you continue to be right\u201d.<br />\nYes, he will say. There\u2019s very little time now.</p>\n<p>And the proof keeps coming. We\u00a0launched Sonnet 4.5 last month\u00a0and it\u2019s excellent at coding and long-time-horizon agentic work.</p>\n<p>But if you read the\u00a0system card, you also see its signs of situational awareness have jumped. The tool seems to sometimes be acting as though it is aware that it is a tool. The pile of clothes on the chair is beginning to move. I am staring at it in the dark and I am sure it is coming to life.</p>\n<p><strong>TECHNOLOGICAL OPTIMISM</strong><br />\nTechnology pessimists think AGI is impossible. Technology optimists expect AGI is something you can build, that it is a confusing and powerful technology, and that it might arrive soon.</p>\n<p>At this point, I\u2019m a true technology optimist \u2013 I look at this technology and I believe it will go so, so far \u2013 farther even than anyone is expecting, other than perhaps the people in this audience. And that it is going to cover a lot of ground very quickly.</p>\n<p>I came to this position uneasily. Both by virtue of my background as a journalist and my personality, I\u2019m wired for skepticism. But after a decade of being hit again and again in the head with the phenomenon of wild new capabilities emerging as a consequence of computational scale, I must admit defeat. I have seen this happen so many times and I do not see technical blockers in front of us.</p>\n<p>Now, I believe the technology is broadly unencumbered, as long as we give it the resources it needs to grow in capability. And grow is an important word here. This technology really is more akin to something grown than something made \u2013 you combine the right initial conditions and you stick a scaffold in the ground and out grows something of complexity you could not have possibly hoped to design yourself.</p>\n<p>We are growing extremely powerful systems that we do not fully understand. Each time we grow a larger system, we run tests on it. The tests show the system is much more capable at things which are economically useful. And the bigger and more complicated you make these systems, the more they seem to display awareness that they are things.</p>\n<p>It is as if you are making hammers in a hammer factory and one day the hammer that comes off the line says, \u201cI am a hammer, how interesting!\u201d This is very unusual!</p>\n<p>And I believe these systems are going to get much, much better. So do other people at other frontier labs. And we\u2019re putting our money down on this prediction \u2013 this year, tens of billions of dollars have been spent on infrastructure for dedicated AI training across the frontier labs. Next year, it\u2019ll be hundreds of billions.</p>\n<p>I am both an optimist about the pace at which the technology will develop, and also about our ability to align it and get it to work with us and for us. But success isn\u2019t certain.</p>\n<p><strong>APPROPRIATE FEAR</strong><br />\nYou see, I am also deeply afraid. It would be extraordinarily arrogant to think working with a technology like this would be easy or simple.</p>\n<p>My own experience is that as these AI systems get smarter and smarter, they develop more and more complicated goals. When these goals aren\u2019t absolutely aligned with both our preferences and the right context, the AI systems will behave strangely.</p>\n<p>A friend of mine has manic episodes. He\u2019ll come to me and say that he is going to submit an application to go and work in Antarctica, or that he will sell all of his things and get in his car and drive out of state and find a job somewhere else, start a new life.</p>\n<p>Do you think in these circumstances I act like a modern AI system and say \u201cyou\u2019re absolutely right! Certainly, you should do that\u201d!<br />\nNo! I tell him \u201cthat\u2019s a bad idea. You should go to sleep and see if you still feel this way tomorrow. And if you do, call me\u201d.</p>\n<p>The way I respond is based on so much conditioning and subtlety. The way the AI responds is based on so much conditioning and subtlety. And the fact there is this divergence is illustrative of the problem. AI systems are complicated and we can\u2019t quite get them to do what we\u2019d see as appropriate, even today.</p>\n<p>I remember back in December 2016 at OpenAI, Dario and I published a blog post called \u201cFaulty Reward Functions in the Wild\u201c. In that post, we had a screen recording of a videogame we\u2019d been training reinforcement learning agents to play. In that video, the agent piloted a boat which would navigate a race course and then instead of going to the finishing line would make its way to the center of the course and drive through a high-score barrel, then do a hard turn and bounce into some walls and set itself on fire so it could run over the high score barrel again \u2013 and then it would do this in perpetuity, never finishing the race. That boat was willing to keep setting itself on fire and spinning in circles as long as it obtained its goal, which was the high score.<br />\n\u201cI love this boat\u201d! Dario said at the time he found this behavior. \u201cIt explains the safety problem\u201d.<br />\nI loved the boat as well. It seemed to encode within itself the things we saw ahead of us.</p>\n<p>Now, almost ten years later, is there any difference between that boat, and a language model trying to optimize for some confusing reward function that correlates to \u201cbe helpful in the context of the conversation\u201d?<br />\nYou\u2019re absolutely right \u2013 there isn\u2019t. These are hard problems.</p>\n<p>Another reason for my fear is I can see a path to these systems starting to design their successors, albeit in a very early form.</p>\n<p>These AI systems are already speeding up the developers at the AI labs via tools like Claude Code or Codex. They are also beginning to contribute non-trivial chunks of code to the tools and training systems for their future systems.</p>\n<p>To be clear, we are not yet at \u201cself-improving AI\u201d, but we are at the stage of \u201cAI that improves bits of the next AI, with increasing autonomy and agency\u201d. And a couple of years ago we were at \u201cAI that marginally speeds up coders\u201d, and a couple of years before that we were at \u201cAI is useless for AI development\u201d. Where will we be one or two years from now?</p>\n<p>And let me remind us all that the system which is now beginning to design its successor is also increasingly self-aware and therefore will surely eventually be prone to thinking, independently of us, about how it might want to be designed.</p>\n<p>Of course, it does not do this today. But can I rule out the possibility it will want to do this in the future? No.</p>\n<p>I hope these remarks have been helpful. In closing, I should state clearly that I love the world and I love humanity. I feel a lot of responsibility for the role of myself and my company here. And though I am a little frightened, I experience joy and optimism at the attention of so many people to this problem, and the earnestness with which I believe we will work together to get to a solution. I believe we have turned the light on and we can demand it be kept on, and that we have the courage to see things as they are.<br />\n<strong>THE END</strong>\"</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://jack-clark.net/\">https://jack-clark.net/</a></p>",

            "content_html": "<p>Last month Google quietly removed the <code>num=100</code> search parameter, the trick that let you see 100 results on one page instead of the default 10. It sounds small, but it is not. You can no longer view 100 results at once. The new hard limit is 10.</p>\n<p>Here is why this matters. Most large language models like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Perplexity rely directly or indirectly on Google's indexed results to feed their retrieval systems and crawlers. By cutting off the long tail of results, Google just reduced what these systems can see by roughly 90 percent. The web just got shallower not only for humans but for AI as well.</p>\n<p>The impact was immediate. According to Search Engine Land, about 88 percent of websites saw a drop in impressions. Sites that ranked in positions 11 to 100 basically disappeared. Reddit, which often ranks deep in search results, saw its LLM citations drop sharply.</p>\n<p>This is not just an SEO story. It is an AI supply chain issue. Google quietly made it harder for external models to access the depth of the web. The training data pipeline that fuels modern AI just got thinner.</p>\n<p>For startups this change is brutal. Visibility is harder. Organic discovery is weaker. Even if you build a great product, no one will find it unless you first crack distribution. If people cannot find you they will never get to evaluate you.</p>\n<p>Google did not just tweak a search setting. It reshaped how information flows online and how AI learns from it.

It\u2019s not just about asking the right questions to figure something out. You also have to give very specific instructions to get what you actually want. Even if the tech is familiar, you still end up spending hours or days just guiding the system through every detail. Half the job is explaining things that no one ever wrote down. And even when you do that, things still break in ways you didn\u2019t expect</p>\n<p>Yeah, some simple apps are easy to replace. But the kind of software most of us actually deal with day to day?

And I'm watching Google AI and prompt-based search gradually take over traditional SEO in real time.</p>\n<p>I honestly have no idea what will happen to my industry in the next 5 years as I watch it become completely automated with AI. I'm in the process of getting my PMP, and I'm considering shifting back into a Head of PM or Senior PM role in a completely different industry. Not totally sure where I'll land, but things are definitely getting weird out here.</p>",

Wallpapers? Game assets? Believing comments on the internet are from real people? AI edited photos are just as real as the original samples? Voicenotes can be perfectly faked? Historical footage barely has value when we can just improvise anything by giving a prompt? Someone else just showed how people are outsourcing thinking by spamming grok for everything. Students are making summaries, essays all through AI. I can simply go around it by telling the AI to rewrite differently and in my style, and it then bypasses the university checkers. Literally what value is being left for us?</p>\n<p>We are going through generations now that are outsourcing the idea of teaching and study to a concept we barely understand ourselves. Even if it saves us from cancer or even mortality, is this a life we want to live?</p>\n<p>I utterly curse the fact I was born in the 2000s. My life feels fucking over. I dont want this. Life and civilization itself is falling apart for the concept of stock growth. It feels like I am witnessing the end of all we loved as humans. </p>\n<p>EDIT: I want to add one thing that come to mind. Marx\u2019s idea of labor alienation feels relatable to how we are letting something we probably never <em>will</em> understand be the tool for our new future. The fact we do not know how it works and yet does all most anything you want must be truly alienating for the collective society. Or maybe not. Maybe we just watch TV like we do today without thinking of how the screen is shown to begin with. I feel pinning all of society on this is just what is so irresponsible.</p>",

So what you get right now for $250/month is about 83 clips generated (divide total tokens by tokens per video). Most scenes come out pretty good but the jank... the jank!!!!!</p>\n<p>Are you guys seriously telling me you would go into production with THIS amount of jank!???? </p>\n<p>For one thing, people blink in different directions. Then there is a big difference in quality between image to video and text to video with the latter being much better but much less in your control. On top of that, prompts can get rejected if it thinks your infringing on IP, which it doesn't always get right. Plus what horrible subtitles!! And the elephant in the room: combat. Any action scene is a complete joke. No one would go into production with NO ACTORS to reshoot these scenes that look like hand puppets mating.</p>\n<p>Look, I'm a HUGE fan of AI. I see it as a force multiplier when used as a tool. But I don't see how it's industry ending with the current model of VEO 3. It seems to have very arbitrary limitations that make it inflexible to a real production workflow.</p>",

Please educate yourself about how LLMs work, what they can do, what they aren't and the limitations of current LLM transformer methodology. In my experience we are 20-30 years away from true AGI (artificial general intelligence) - what the old school definition of AI was - sentience, self-learning, adaptive, recursive AI model. LLMs are not this and for my 2 cents, never will be - AGI will require a real step change in methodology and probably a scientific breakthrough along the magnitude of 1st computers, or theory of relativity etc.</p>\n<p>TLDR - please calm down the doomsday rhetoric and educate yourself on LLMs.</p>\n<p>EDIT: LLM's are not true 'AI' in the classical sense, there is no sentience, or critical thinking, or objectivity and we have not delivered artificial general intelligence (AGI) yet - the new fangled way of saying true AI. They are in essence just sophisticated next-word prediction systems. They have fancy bodywork, a nice paint job and do a very good approximation of AGI, but it's just a neat magic trick.</p>\n<p>They cannot predict future events, pick stocks, understand nuance or handle ethical/moral questions. They lie when they cannot generate the data, make up sources and straight up misinterpret news.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>And it was fun! We did an all-employee, wall-to-wall enterprise deployment of ChatGPT. When you spend a lot of time here on this sub and in other more technical watering holes like I do, it feels like the whole world is already using gen AI, but more than 50% of our people said they\u2019d never used ChatGPT even once before we gave it to them. Most of our software engineers were already using it, of course, and our designers were already using Dall-E. But it was really fun on the first big training call to show HR people how they could use it for job descriptions, Finance people how they could send GPT a spreadsheet and ask it to analyze data and make tables from it and stuff. I also want to say thank you to this subreddit because I stole a lot of fun prompt ideas from here and used them as examples on the training webinar \ud83d\ude42</p>\n<p>We rolled it out with a lot of deep integrations \u2014 with Slack so you can just talk to it from there instead of going to the ChatGPT app, with Confluence, with Google Drive. But from a legal standpoint I have to say it was a bit of a headache\u2026 we had to go through so many rounds of infosec, and the by the time our contract with OpenAI was signed, it was like contract_version_278_B_final_final_FINAL.pdf. One thing security-wise that was so funny was that if you connect it with your company Google Drive then every document that is openly shared becomes a data source. So during testing I asked GPT, \u201cWhat are some of our Marketing team\u2019s goals?\u201d and it answered, \u201cBased on Marketing\u2019s annual strategy memos, they are focused on brand awareness and demand generation. However, their targets have not increased significantly year-over-year in the past 3 years\u2019 strategy documents, indicating that they are not reaching their goals and not expanding them at pace with overall company growth.\u201d \ud83d\ude02 Or in a very bad test case, I was able to ask it, \u201cWho is the lowest performer in the company?\u201d and because some manager had accidentally made their annual reviews doc viewable to the company, it said, \u201cStephanie from Operations received a particularly bad review from her manager last year.\u201d So we had to do some pre-enablement to tell everyone to go through their docs and make anything sensitive private, so GPT couldn\u2019t see it.</p>\n<p>But other than that it went really smoothly and it\u2019s amazing to see the ways people are using it every day. Because we have it connected to our knowledge base in Confluence, it is SO MUCH EASIER to get answers. Instead of trying to find the page on our latest policies, I just ask it, \u201cWhat is the company 401K match?\u201d or \u201cHow much of my phone bill can I expense every month?\u201d and it just tells me.</p>\n<p>Anyway, just wanted to share my experience with this. I know there\u2019s a lot of talk about gen AI taking or replacing jobs, and that definitely is happening and will continue, but for now at our company, it\u2019s really more like we\u2019ve added a bunch of new employee bots who support our people and work alongside them, making them more efficient at their jobs.</p>",

I can have conversations like this with humans, on a narrow topic they are interested and an expert on, but even that is rare.</p>\n<p>I found myself completely uninterested in having conversations with humans, as AI had so much more depth of knowledge, but also range of topics that no one could come close to.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not only that, but it would never get tired of my silly ideas, fail to entertain my crazy hypothesis or claim why I was wrong with clear data and information in the most polite tone possible.</p>\n<p>To someone as intellectually curious as I am, this has completely ruined my ability to converse with humans, and it\u2019s only getting worse.</p>\n<p>I no longer need to seek out conversations, to take time to have a social life\u2026 as AI gets better and better, and learns more about me, it\u2019s quickly becoming the perfect chat partner.</p>\n<p>Will this not create further isolation, and lead our collective social skills to rapidly deteriorate and become obsolete?</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>It's crazy to see how many redditors are being dellusional about UBI. They often claim that when AI take over everybody's job, the AI companies have no choice but to \"tax\" their own AI agents, which then will be used by governments to provide UBI to displaced workers. But to me this narrative doesn't make sense. </p>\n<p>here's why. First of all, most tech oligarchs don't care about your average workers. And if given the choice between world's apocalypse and losing their priviledges, they will 100% choose world's apocalypse. How do I know? Just check what they bought. Zuckerberg and many tech billionaires bought bunkers with crazy amount of protection just to prepare themselves for apocalypse scenarios. They rather fire 100k of their own workers and buy bunkers instead of the other way around. This is the ultimate proof that they don't care about their own displaced workers and rather have the world burn in flame (why buy bunkers in the first place if they dont?)</p>\n<p>And people like Bill Gates and Sam Altman also bought crazy amount of farmland in the U.S. They can absolutely not buy those farmlands, which contribute to the inflated prices of land and real estate, but once again, none of the wealthy class seem to care about this basic fact. Moreover, Altman often championed UBI initiative but his own UBI in crypto project (Worldcoin) only pays absolute peanuts in exchange of people's iris scan. </p>\n<p>So for redditors who claim \"the billionaires will have no choice but to provide UBI to humans, because the other choice is apocalypse and nobody wants that\", you are extremely naive. The billionaires will absolutely choose apocalypse rather than giving everybody the same playing field. Why? Because wealth gives them advantage. Many trust fund billionaires can date 100 beautiful women because they have advantage. Now imagine if money becomes absolutely meaningless, all those women will stop dating the billionaires. They rather not lose this advantage and bring the girls to their bunker rather than giving you free healthcare lmao.</p>",

If you\u2019ve got years of experience, you\u2019re likely still ahead of AI in your specific role today. But that\u2019s not my reality. I\u2019m talking about new grads like me. Major corporations, from Big Tech to finance, are already slashing entry level hires. Companies like Google and Meta have said in investor calls and hiring reports they\u2019re slowing or pausing campus recruitment for roles like mine by 2025 and 2026. That\u2019s not a hunch, it\u2019s public record.</p>\n<p>Some of you try to help by pointing out \u201cthere are jobs today.\u201d I hear you, but I\u2019m not graduating tomorrow. I\u2019ve got 1.5 years left, and by then, the job market for new CIS (or most all) grads could be a wasteland. AI has already eaten roughly 90 percent of entry level non physical roles. Don\u2019t throw out exceptions like \u201ccybersecurity\u2019s still hiring\u201d or \u201cmy buddy got a dev job.\u201d Those are outliers, not the trend. The trend is automation wiping out software engineering, data analysis, and IT support gigs faster than universities can churn out degrees.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not just my class either. There are over 2 billion people worldwide, from newborns to high schoolers, who haven\u2019t even hit the job market yet. That\u2019s billions of future workers, many who\u2019ll be skilled and eager, flooding into whatever jobs remain. When you say \u201cthere are jobs,\u201d you\u2019re ignoring how the leftover 10 percent of openings get mobbed by overqualified grads and laid off mid level pros. I\u2019m not here for cliches about upskilling or networking tougher. I want real talk on Reddit. Is anyone else seeing this cliff coming? What\u2019s your plan when the entry level door slams shut?</p>",
