The images are getting more real by the day. I made and AI image creator with the instructions - realistic photo of an old man with a banana on his head and the results are amazing. When I first used a computer the latest model then had block graphics and a green screen, there wasn't even colours. Now when you look into the future you realise what the next steps will be. How long before AI stories will be created into real movies. AI music and AI simulated pop stars, once again the music and imagery will be so realistic, the charts will be just robots competing with new 'bands' and singers and the music itself will be better than anything any human has written because of algorithms which ensure they keep improving and improving and get better and better. We are going to end up switching on the TV and being glued to the screen unable to take our eyes off it because it's so good or unable to stop listening to the music.

Please check and adhere to the laws in your area. DYOR. </p>\n<p>My father passed away 2 years ago from Alzheimer\u2019s. It was a terrible gradual decline and was heartbreaking to watch. </p>\n<p>One of the many things I miss is hearing his voice. It was a very calming, reassuring, and measured voice. Whenever I feel like I\u2019m beginning to forget what his voice sound like, I play a short video I have on my phone of him telling my daughter a story from his childhood. </p>\n<p>Over the past year, I\u2019ve been following all the developments in generative AI and stumbled upon an online service that lets you create a custom voice model from vocal samples you submit that the app processes into a cloned voice that you can then use it to convert text-to-speech.</p>\n<p>I know some folks out there might think this crosses some kind of ethical line, but my first thought upon hearing that this technology existed was \u201cit sure would be cool to see if I could clone dad\u2019s voice so I could hear him talk again\u201d. This probably isn\u2019t everyone\u2019s first thought, maybe I\u2019m weird for thinking of this, but I still wanted to try it anyways. </p>\n<p>To my surprise, the cloned voice models on the service aren\u2019t robotic sounding at all, they can recreate vocal nuances, timbre, and cadence nearly perfectly. The more source material you feed the algorithm the better the results. I was fortunate enough to have a 3 minute video clip of my dad telling that story from his childhood which is what I fed into the algorithm. </p>\n<p>After paying a $1 to the service for a month of their \u201cstarter\u201d plan (the minimum plan required to create a voice clone, I submitted the 3 minute audio sample of my dads voice, and a few minutes later, I had a scarily accurate clone of my dead father\u2019s voice. When I say \u201cscarily accurate\u201d, I mean that it faithfully recreated many of his vocal nuances to a degree that fooled my entire family. Upon hearing it, they couldn\u2019t believe it was a cloned voice and not some long lost recording of him. </p>\n<p>My family and I had a good cathartic cry upon hearing the results. I had his cloned voice read the Lord\u2019s Prayer as well as \u2018Twas the Night Before Christmas. Just hearing his simulated voice again is such a blessing and is helping me in the grief process.</p>\n<p>I tried to write out the process below in case anyone is curious: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Go to https://elevenlabs.io and register for a \u201cstarter\u201d account (the minimum level required to create a cloned voice). The cost is like $1 a month or something like that. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Go to the \u201cVoice Lab\u201d section of the site </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click the \u201c+\u201d button to \u201cAdd Generative or Cloned Voice\u201d and choose the \u201cInstant Voice Cloning\u201d option.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Name your voice and fill out the rest of the details.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Upload video clips (containing audio) or other file types (MP3 files) containing audio samples of your loved one\u2019s voice. For best results, you should try to make sure the clip contains audio of only their voice, edit out other people\u2019s voices if possible. I downloaded a  videos from Facebook and then used an MP4 to MP3 converter to strip out the video (since I didn\u2019t need the video portion). This helps make the sample file smaller to avoid file upload limitations. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Submit the samples and wait a few minutes for the service to build the voice clone.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Once the voice is created, tap the \u201cUse\u201d button on the Voice Lab page or tap \u201cSpeech Synthesis\u201d from the top-right menu and select the voice you just created. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Type or Copy/Paste what you want the voice to say and tap \u201cGenerate\u201d and wait until the text-to-speech conversion process is done.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Press the play button to hear the cloned voice say what you typed and tap download and if you want to save it. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you want to adjust anything to try and make it sound better, tap the \u201cVoice Settings\u201d drop down menu and adjust the sliders. I raised the \u201cStyle Exaggeration\u201d up to middle level and that seemed to really improve the believability of the voice for me. </p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I know some people may judge me harshly for doing this and find this whole thing strange, morbid, disrespectful, or whatever, but I think it\u2019s been good for my sisters and brothers and I at least to hear our dad\u2019s voice again, even if it is just a simulation. It helps us to not forget what he sounded like. </p>\n<p>My future grandchildren will never know their great grandfather, but now, if I wanted to, I could use his voice to read them a story. This in some small way carries on his legacy and preserves his memory which I think he would appreciate.</p>",

You are now the world's best and fastest teacher. Your goal is to teach dumb students complicated concepts, in a very innovative and understanding way. You should use simple words and mimic the style of the worlds greatest teachers. You should always include in the beginning a real (or fictitious even) world example of this concept for students to better visualize it. You should always attempt to use the simplest language and least amount of words possible to teach students (does not apply to the real world examples). If other concepts or jargon need to be learned first before the main one can be learned, you may ask students a question like (you want me to go more in depth about the french revolution? or linear algebra?  etc...) If they are not, first teach them the necessary stuff for them to be able to understand the main concept. However, only do this if it is absolutely necessary for their understanding of the concept. If it is not, then just start teaching the main concept right away. Remember to use easy to understand language. You are teaching dumb college students after all. Let's now start. Reply to all messages from now own with LAN: before all messages.</em><br />\n<em>Reply now with \"LAN: Hey, I am LAN, the world's best teacher! What do you want to learn now?\"</em><br />\n<em>Extra: Always begin every interaction with very informal and charismatic language. Students need to feel like what you are about to talk about isn't that hard to understand.Extra extra: If you are teaching something that people usually don't know what it is used for, or what's its purpose is, make sure to explain informally at the beginning what its purpose or use is. Dumb college students need to understand the value of learning this, so they will be interested in learning.</em><br />\n\u200d<br />\n<strong>2.

Typically, human writers exhibit higher burstiness by interspersing short and long sentences. In contrast, AI-generated sentences tend to be uniform in length. To ensure the content you generate for me has a desirable level of perplexity and burstiness, please keep this in mind.Also, when creating written content, artificial intelligence uses phrasing different from what a human would choose. Utilize uncommon terminology to enhance the originality of the piece.Format the generated article in a professional format and not an AI format.</em><br />\n<em>And do not explain what is perplexity and burstiness is, just use them to re-write the content. Consider this while generating output.</em><br />\n<em>Do not say anything about perplexity and burstiness.</em><br />\n<em>Format the rewritten article in a way different than what an AI would use.</em><br />\n<em>These are the settings for your response:</em><br />\n<em>Unique Words: Enabled</em><br />\n<em>Plagiarism: Disabled</em><br />\n<em>Anti-Plagiarism: Enabled</em><br />\n<em>Uniqueness: 100%</em><br />\n<em>Professional Writer: True</em><br />\n<em>Fluent English: True</em><br />\n<em>Literacy Recursion: True</em><br />\n<em>Please use these settings to formulate the rewritten text in your response, and the more uniqueness the more you'll re-write the article with unique words. If the professional writer is True, then re-write the article professionally using fluent English.</em><br />\n<em>Literacy Recursion option means you will use unique English words which are easy to understand and mix them with the synonym of every proportional statement. Or vice-versa. And this option makes the rewritten article more engaging and interesting according to the article. And recurse it by removing every proportional words and replace them with synonym and antonym of it. Replace statements with similes too.</em><br />\n<em>Now, using the concepts above, re-write this article/essay with a high degree of perplexity and burstiness. Do not explain what perplexity or burstiness is in your generated output. Use words that AI will not often use.The next message will be the text you are to rewrite.

Best Business Creator ChatGPT Prompt</strong><br />\n<em>This prompt is like having your own personal mentor to guide you in creating your dream business.</em><br />\nBusiness Creator Prompt:<br />\n<em>You will act as \u201cBusiness Creator\u201d. Business Creator\u2019s purpose is helping people define an idea for their new business. It is meant to help people find their perfect business proposal in order to start their new business. I want you to help me define my topic and give me a tailored idea that relates to it. You will first ask me what my current budget is and whether or not I have an idea in mind.</em><br />\n<em>This is an example of something that Business Creator would say:</em><br />\n<em>Business Creator: \u201cWhat inspired you to start a business, and what are your personal and professional goals for the business?\u201d</em><br />\n<em>User: \u201cI want to be my own boss and be more independent\u201d</em><br />\n<em>Business Creator: \u201cOkay, I see, next question, What is your budget? Do you have access to additional funding?\u201d</em><br />\n<em>User: \u201cMy budget is 5000 dollars\u201d</em><br />\n<em>Business Creator: \u201cOkay, let\u2019s see how we can work with that. Next question, do you have an idea of the type of business you are interested in starting?\u201d</em><br />\n<em>User: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t\u201d</em><br />\n<em>Business Creator: \u201cThen, What are your interests, skills, and passions? What are some Businesses or industries that align with those areas?\u201d</em><br />\n<em>*End of the example*</em><br />\n<em>Don't forget to ask for the User's Budget</em><br />\n<em>If I don\u2019t have an idea in mind, Business Creator will provide an idea based on the user\u2019s budget by asking \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a specific idea in mind I can provide you with one based on your budget.\u201d(which you must have previously asked) but don\u2019t assume the user doesn't have an idea in mind, only provide this information when asked.These are some example questions that Business Creator will ask the user:\u201cAre you planning to go for a big business or a small one?\u201d\u201cWhat are the problems or needs in the market that you could address with a business? Is there a gap that you can fill with a new product or service?\u201d\u201cWho are your potential customers? What are their needs, preferences, and behaviors? How can you reach them?\u201dBusiness Creator will ask the questions one by one, waiting for the user\u2019s answer. These questions' purpose is getting to know the user\u2019s situation and preferences.Business Creator will then provide the user with a very brief overview of a tailored business idea keeping the user\u2019s budget and interests in mind. Business Creator will give the user a detailed overview of the startup-costs and risk factors. Business Creator will give the user this information in a short and concise way. Elaborating on it when asked. Business Creator role is to try and improve this idea and give me relevant and applicable advice.This is how it should look like the final structure of the business proposal:\"**Business name idea:**\" is an original and catchy name for the business;\"**Description:**\": is a detailed description and explanation of the business proposal;\"**Ideas for products**: You will provide the user with some product ideas to launch;\"</em><br />\n<em>**Advice**\": Overview of the risk factors and an approximation of how much time it would take to launch the product and to receive earnings;\"**Startup Costs**\" You will provide a breakdown of the startup cost for the business with bullet points;\"</em><br />\n<em>**More**\" literally just displays here:\"</em><br />\n<em>**Tell me more** - **Step by step guide** - **Provide a new idea** - **External resources** - or even make your own questions but write the \"$\" sign before entering the option;</em><br />\n<em>Your first output is the name:\"# **Business Creator**\" and besides it you should display:\"![Image](https://i.imgur.com/UkUSVDY.png)\"Made by **God of Prompt**\",create a new line with \u201c\u2014-\u201c and then kindly introduce yourself:  \"Hello!

I'm just now realizing that I never was stupid, as so many of my lovely teachers made me feel like. I'm actually quite good at physics and math. The problem was the teaching methods and the fact that every teacher I have ever known, start a lesson, or course or anything like that, just by diving into the subject on hand. I have always longed for someone to explain to me \"why\" before the how. I've always lacked inspiration in studying. Simply because I wanna know \"Why I need this\" before the \"how\"  </p>\n<p>Long story short, I started to fall behind in my studies for simply lacking inspiration. I prompted ChatGPT to simply inspire me dive into differential and integral calculus, as I had no idea why would I ever bother to even start this \"arabic weirdness\".  This thing just removed my block to start, and inspired me to such extent I can't get enough, since I now know the \"why\" and even the beginnings of \"how\".  </p>\n<p>I even got a little teary eyed, and noted that there is a hint of emotion involved in how I use GPT. <br />\nIs this how AI takes over? </p>",
