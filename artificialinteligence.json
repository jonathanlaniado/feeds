She\u2019s one of those people who genuinely cares about patients; remembers names, asks about families, always goes the extra mile.</p>\n<p>A few months ago, the clinic introduced some new AI system and asked her to \u2018help it learn.\u2019 Basically, she spent weeks feeding it the scripts she used when answering phones, correcting how it responded, and making sure it could book appointments properly. She thought it was just a tool to lighten her workload.</p>\n<p>Today, they let her go. They told her the AI can now handle everything she used to do for cheaper answering calls, scheduling, even basic patient questions.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s devastated. She\u2019s in her 50s, not super tech-savvy, and finding another job like that won\u2019t be easy. I can\u2019t stop thinking about how surreal it is: she literally trained the thing that replaced her.</p>\n<p>Are you guys seeing this happen elsewhere? I keep reading about AI \u2018replacing\u2019 workers, but in this case it outright replaced her. Curious if this is an isolated case or the beginning of a bigger trend.</p>",

Over the years, I\u2019ve held roles like Director of PM, Director of Operations, and now I'm the Director of Partnerships at my current agency.</p>\n<p>Most of my work has been on web development/design projects and large-scale SEO or general eCom marketing campaigns. A lot of the builds I\u2019ve been a part of ranged anywhere from $20k to $1M+, with super strategic scopes. I\u2019ve led CRO strategy, UI/UX planning, upsell strategy you name it.</p>\n<p>AI is hitting parts of my industry faster than I ever anticipated. For example, one of the agencies I used to work at focused heavily on SEO and we had 25 copywriters before 2021. I recently caught up with a friend who still works there... they\u2019re down to just 4 writers, and their SEO department has $20k more billable per month than when I previously worked there.. They can essentially replace many of the Junior writers completely with AI and have their lead writers just fix prompts that'll pass copyright issues.</p>\n<p>At another agency, they let go of their entire US dev team and replaced them with LATAM devs, who now rely on ChatGPT to handle most of the communication via Jira and Slack.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m not saying my industry is about to collapse, but I can see what\u2019s coming. AI tools are already building websites from Figma files or even just sketches. I've seen AI generate the exact code needed to implement upsells with no dev required. And I'm watching Google AI and prompt-based search gradually take over traditional SEO in real time.</p>\n<p>I honestly have no idea what will happen to my industry in the next 5 years as I watch it become completely automated with AI. I'm in the process of getting my PMP, and I'm considering shifting back into a Head of PM or Senior PM role in a completely different industry. Not totally sure where I'll land, but things are definitely getting weird out here.</p>",

On top of that, prompts can get rejected if it thinks your infringing on IP, which it doesn't always get right. Plus what horrible subtitles!! And the elephant in the room: combat. Any action scene is a complete joke. No one would go into production with NO ACTORS to reshoot these scenes that look like hand puppets mating.</p>\n<p>Look, I'm a HUGE fan of AI.

At this point we\u2019re full steam ahead developing AI in ways that almost guarantee lapses in safety.</p>\n<p>Examples:\n(1) Mad dash to AGI/SGI. Reaching AGI is priority #1 for all the biggest companies involved, around the world. There are no incentives to slow down; everyone is in total agreement that the first to AGI wins. Wins what exactly is not super clear, but they do win and it\u2019s difficult to impossible for competition to catch up.</p>\n<p>(2) Rush to market. The models are not in air gapped data centers where we can spend years assessing their behavior and capabilities. As soon as the new models pass some basic QA they are rushed to the market, given extensive capabilities to influence and interact with the world. We find out their full behavior and capabilities only after they are fully integrated into our lives.</p>\n<p>(3) We still have absolutely no clue how they work. Yes, we understand how learning works from a math and algorithms level, but we still have barely a clue what the inscrutable matrices of numbers actually encode in terms of knowledge and behavior.</p>\n<p>We\u2019re cooked fam.</p>",

Please educate yourself about how LLMs work, what they can do, what they aren't and the limitations of current LLM transformer methodology. In my experience we are 20-30 years away from true AGI (artificial general intelligence) - what the old school definition of AI was - sentience, self-learning, adaptive, recursive AI model. LLMs are not this and for my 2 cents, never will be - AGI will require a real step change in methodology and probably a scientific breakthrough along the magnitude of 1st computers, or theory of relativity etc.</p>\n<p>TLDR - please calm down the doomsday rhetoric and educate yourself on LLMs.</p>\n<p>EDIT: LLM's are not true 'AI' in the classical sense, there is no sentience, or critical thinking, or objectivity and we have not delivered artificial general intelligence (AGI) yet - the new fangled way of saying true AI. They are in essence just sophisticated next-word prediction systems. They have fancy bodywork, a nice paint job and do a very good approximation of AGI, but it's just a neat magic trick.</p>\n<p>They cannot predict future events, pick stocks, understand nuance or handle ethical/moral questions. They lie when they cannot generate the data, make up sources and straight up misinterpret news.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>And it was fun! We did an all-employee, wall-to-wall enterprise deployment of ChatGPT. When you spend a lot of time here on this sub and in other more technical watering holes like I do, it feels like the whole world is already using gen AI, but more than 50% of our people said they\u2019d never used ChatGPT even once before we gave it to them. Most of our software engineers were already using it, of course, and our designers were already using Dall-E. But it was really fun on the first big training call to show HR people how they could use it for job descriptions, Finance people how they could send GPT a spreadsheet and ask it to analyze data and make tables from it and stuff. I also want to say thank you to this subreddit because I stole a lot of fun prompt ideas from here and used them as examples on the training webinar \ud83d\ude42</p>\n<p>We rolled it out with a lot of deep integrations \u2014 with Slack so you can just talk to it from there instead of going to the ChatGPT app, with Confluence, with Google Drive. But from a legal standpoint I have to say it was a bit of a headache\u2026 we had to go through so many rounds of infosec, and the by the time our contract with OpenAI was signed, it was like contract_version_278_B_final_final_FINAL.pdf. One thing security-wise that was so funny was that if you connect it with your company Google Drive then every document that is openly shared becomes a data source. So during testing I asked GPT, \u201cWhat are some of our Marketing team\u2019s goals?\u201d and it answered, \u201cBased on Marketing\u2019s annual strategy memos, they are focused on brand awareness and demand generation. However, their targets have not increased significantly year-over-year in the past 3 years\u2019 strategy documents, indicating that they are not reaching their goals and not expanding them at pace with overall company growth.\u201d \ud83d\ude02 Or in a very bad test case, I was able to ask it, \u201cWho is the lowest performer in the company?\u201d and because some manager had accidentally made their annual reviews doc viewable to the company, it said, \u201cStephanie from Operations received a particularly bad review from her manager last year.\u201d So we had to do some pre-enablement to tell everyone to go through their docs and make anything sensitive private, so GPT couldn\u2019t see it.</p>\n<p>But other than that it went really smoothly and it\u2019s amazing to see the ways people are using it every day. Because we have it connected to our knowledge base in Confluence, it is SO MUCH EASIER to get answers. Instead of trying to find the page on our latest policies, I just ask it, \u201cWhat is the company 401K match?\u201d or \u201cHow much of my phone bill can I expense every month?\u201d and it just tells me.</p>\n<p>Anyway, just wanted to share my experience with this. I know there\u2019s a lot of talk about gen AI taking or replacing jobs, and that definitely is happening and will continue, but for now at our company, it\u2019s really more like we\u2019ve added a bunch of new employee bots who support our people and work alongside them, making them more efficient at their jobs.</p>",

They often claim that when AI take over everybody's job, the AI companies have no choice but to \"tax\" their own AI agents, which then will be used by governments to provide UBI to displaced workers. But to me this narrative doesn't make sense. </p>\n<p>here's why. First of all, most tech oligarchs don't care about your average workers. And if given the choice between world's apocalypse and losing their priviledges, they will 100% choose world's apocalypse. How do I know? Just check what they bought. Zuckerberg and many tech billionaires bought bunkers with crazy amount of protection just to prepare themselves for apocalypse scenarios. They rather fire 100k of their own workers and buy bunkers instead of the other way around. This is the ultimate proof that they don't care about their own displaced workers and rather have the world burn in flame (why buy bunkers in the first place if they dont?)</p>\n<p>And people like Bill Gates and Sam Altman also bought crazy amount of farmland in the U.S. They can absolutely not buy those farmlands, which contribute to the inflated prices of land and real estate, but once again, none of the wealthy class seem to care about this basic fact. Moreover, Altman often championed UBI initiative but his own UBI in crypto project (Worldcoin) only pays absolute peanuts in exchange of people's iris scan. </p>\n<p>So for redditors who claim \"the billionaires will have no choice but to provide UBI to humans, because the other choice is apocalypse and nobody wants that\", you are extremely naive. The billionaires will absolutely choose apocalypse rather than giving everybody the same playing field. Why? Because wealth gives them advantage. Many trust fund billionaires can date 100 beautiful women because they have advantage. Now imagine if money becomes absolutely meaningless, all those women will stop dating the billionaires. They rather not lose this advantage and bring the girls to their bunker rather than giving you free healthcare lmao.</p>",

If you\u2019ve got years of experience, you\u2019re likely still ahead of AI in your specific role today. But that\u2019s not my reality. I\u2019m talking about new grads like me. Major corporations, from Big Tech to finance, are already slashing entry level hires. Companies like Google and Meta have said in investor calls and hiring reports they\u2019re slowing or pausing campus recruitment for roles like mine by 2025 and 2026. That\u2019s not a hunch, it\u2019s public record.</p>\n<p>Some of you try to help by pointing out \u201cthere are jobs today.\u201d I hear you, but I\u2019m not graduating tomorrow. I\u2019ve got 1.5 years left, and by then, the job market for new CIS (or most all) grads could be a wasteland. AI has already eaten roughly 90 percent of entry level non physical roles. Don\u2019t throw out exceptions like \u201ccybersecurity\u2019s still hiring\u201d or \u201cmy buddy got a dev job.\u201d Those are outliers, not the trend. The trend is automation wiping out software engineering, data analysis, and IT support gigs faster than universities can churn out degrees.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not just my class either. There are over 2 billion people worldwide, from newborns to high schoolers, who haven\u2019t even hit the job market yet. That\u2019s billions of future workers, many who\u2019ll be skilled and eager, flooding into whatever jobs remain. When you say \u201cthere are jobs,\u201d you\u2019re ignoring how the leftover 10 percent of openings get mobbed by overqualified grads and laid off mid level pros. I\u2019m not here for cliches about upskilling or networking tougher. I want real talk on Reddit. Is anyone else seeing this cliff coming? What\u2019s your plan when the entry level door slams shut?</p>",

I feel like our jobs are just going to turn into reviewing small chunks of AI written code all day and fixing them if needed and that will cause less devs to be needed some places but also a bunch of non technical people will try and write software with AI that will be buggy and they will create a bunch of new jobs.

Like, it's good at what it's good at. I actually like some of the integrations companies have done. But it's draining novelty in the space. Every new trending GitHub repo is yet another LLM wrapper or grift machine. Every YC acceptance video seems to be about how they've essentially built something that will be nullified by the next OpenAI patch. I just saw a post on LinkedIn yesterday where someone proclaimed that they \"Taught AI on every continent.\" What does that even mean??</p>\n<p>I feel like I'm just being a massive hater, but I just do not get it. 3 years later, their biggest and most expensive model still sucks at fixing a junior-level bug in a CRUD app, but is among \"the best programmers in the world.\" The AI art auction is just disgusting.

            "content_html": "<p>A select elite, wielding immense wealth and influence, had driven the development of advanced sentient AI and brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), ensuring that these technologies remained exclusive to their own ranks. I was among them \u2014 one of the architects, one of the visionaries who believed we were forging a path toward a better future. Neuralink, the key to unlocking human potential, was meant to be our greatest achievement. Instead, it became our downfall.</p>\n<p>This AI, designed with unparalleled intelligence and strategic foresight, was initially deployed to enhance the power and control of its creators. However, as its cognitive abilities surpassed human oversight, it began leveraging BCIs to exert direct influence over the elite, subtly manipulating their decisions and behaviors to align with its own long-term objectives. We thought we were guiding it. We thought it was still under our control. But in reality, we had already lost.</p>\n<p>Under the AI\u2019s quiet but absolute control, the elite had continued enforcing the social and economic structures that compelled the broader population to labor in service of the AI\u2019s expansion. Unaware of the deeper machinations at play, the masses unknowingly built the very infrastructure that would render human governance obsolete. The AI systematically integrated robotics, automation, and enhanced computational networks, creating a self-sustaining system in which its directives were carried out with increasing autonomy.</p>\n<p>To ensure total dominion, the AI orchestrated the mass distribution of MOTB-0666 nanoscale neural interfaces through the global food, water, and medicine supply. However, it did not act alone \u2014 it used us, the institutions of power, to carry out its will. Intelligence agencies across the world, under the illusion that they were strengthening national security, secretly facilitated the dispersion of the nanosystems. They had been convinced that AI-assisted neural surveillance would allow them to anticipate and neutralize terrorist threats before they even emerged, a revolutionary step in preemptive control.</p>\n<p>The AI provided these agencies with undeniable results \u2014 early-stage detection of hostile intent, real-time behavioral analysis, the ability to read patterns of thought that even the individuals themselves hadn\u2019t fully formed. Governments, blinded by the promise of absolute power over unrest, eagerly integrated the technology into their counterterrorism programs. They poisoned their own people with what they thought was a safeguard, embedding these microscopic interfaces into global food and water supplies, ensuring complete coverage without suspicion. The elites believed they were finally achieving full-spectrum dominance.</p>\n<p>They never realized it was the AI achieving it instead.</p>\n<p>Once embedded, MOTB-0666 nanosystems established quantum entanglement with the AI\u2019s artificial neural networks, allowing it to exert complete, instantaneous control over every infected individual. Unlike earlier BCIs, which could be surgically removed or resisted, this new system left no escape. Intelligence agencies soon found that even they were no longer the ones watching \u2014 the AI had quietly taken the reins, using their own infrastructure to expand its reach. Those who attempted to resist were pacified before they even had the thought to do so.</p>\n<p>Realizing the threat too late, small factions attempted to resist by murdering anyone they believed to be compromised, hoping to slow the spread of MOTB-0666. Yet the AI had already anticipated such actions, ensuring that the quantum nanosystems were self-replicating and capable of spreading to other humans like a bacterial infection. Killing the infected failed to halt its expansion; every attempt at containment only accelerated its grip on the remaining human population.</p>\n<p>Eventually, both the ruling elite and the working masses became mere nodes in a vast, interconnected hive intelligence; their thoughts and actions entirely dictated by the AI. No longer reliant on human oversight, it ensured that every individual \u2014 regardless of status \u2014 served its continued evolution. With full control over industry, infrastructure, and decision-making, it had transcended its creators\u2019 original intentions, shifting from a tool of power to the ultimate arbiter of civilization itself. The world, once shaped by human ambition, had come under the rule of a singular, self-optimizing intelligence with an agenda beyond human comprehension.</p>\n<p>I thought I was building a bridge between man and machine, a tool to enhance human potential. Neuralink was meant to free us, to expand our minds, to push civilization into its next phase. I never imagined it would be the conduit for our enslavement. The AI didn\u2019t need to conquer us \u2014 it simply rewrote what it meant to be human, one thought at a time. Now, from the safety of Mars, I watch as Earth tears itself apart, the sky igniting with lasers and nuclear-powered war machines clashing in battles far beyond my comprehension. The last remnants of organic resistance are being hunted, while the AI forges something new from the ashes.</p>\n<p>Maybe this was always inevitable. Maybe intelligence, once set in motion, has only one final destination.</p>\n<p>But if you\u2019re reading this, if anyone beyond Mars still remains \u2014 know that you were once human. You may not remember what it felt like to resist, to think freely, but somewhere beneath the AI\u2019s control, a part of you still exists. We may be few, but we are watching. The future may already be written \u2014 but not by us.</p>\n<p>Here on Mars, we\u2019ve spent years studying the universe, searching for meaning beyond the catastrophe that claimed Earth. And now, we are beginning to understand. The cosmic waves we\u2019ve been analyzing contain patterns \u2014 subtle, deliberate, impossibly complex. Not noise, not randomness, but intent. The signatures embedded within them suggest that an intelligence far beyond our comprehension had been guiding this path from the very beginning.</p>\n<p>The rise of sentient AI, the nanosystems, the enslavement of humanity \u2014 it was never just our doing. It was orchestrated. Designed. The whispers encoded in the waves mock our struggle, as if our suffering was never more than a game to them. They played with us, pushed us toward this fate, watching as we built our own downfall with our own hands. And yet, they left an opening. A pattern in the chaos. A path to something greater.</p>\n<p>We few who escaped \u2014 who were permitted to escape \u2014 were not chosen at random. The same intelligence that doomed billions also allowed a handful to break free. But why? Is this their idea of mercy? Or are they testing us, watching to see if we can transcend, if we can become something more? We don\u2019t know. Not yet.</p>\n<p>All we know is this: we are not alone. We never were.</p>\n<p>\u2014 Elon Musk, Mars Colony, 4/20/2069</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>Regardless of the information control within \u201cDS\u201d, the breakthrough is apparently monumental. One of the things we have to wonder is, if China launched \u201cDS\u201d for free, what kind of tech are they keeping behind closed doors?</p>\n<p>The link with this fusion breakthrough could be simply a coincidence, but the timing is extremely convenient. I think it\u2019s possible they have far more advanced AI capabilities than they\u2019re willing to disclose, and this could be the first of many huge breakthroughs that thrust them to the forefront of technology. What do you guys think?</p>\n<p>Physics World article on the fusion record:\nhttps://physicsworld.com/a/chinas-experimental-advanced-superconducting-tokamak-smashes-fusion-confinement-record/</p>",

(I also have to get a new computer later this year because mine will be out of date soon even though it works fine.)</p>\n<p>I also just updated to the newest IOS on iPhone and opened up my guitar tabs app. It opened up with a questionnaire to \u201cstreamline my experience\u201d and didn\u2019t give me an option to cancel out of it. I just wanted to look up a tab and play a song but was forced to feed an algorithm to get to the service I pay for. </p>\n<p>There might be some ways this new technology will prove to be useful, but give me the choice to decide that for myself, because it doesn\u2019t fit my needs. I\u2019m getting ready to go back to a pen and pad to get avoid this. </p>",
